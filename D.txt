Question 1
Which two security mechanisms are used by Cisco Threat Defense to gain visibility into the most dangerous cyber threats? (Choose two)
A. dynamic enforce policy
B. file reputation
C. virtual private networks
D. Traffic Telemetry
E. VLAN segmentation

Answer: BD

Explanation
Threat defense: It is important to have visibility into the most dangerous cyber threats. Threat defense provides this visibility through network traffic telemetry, file reputation, and contextual information (such as device types, locations, users, identities, roles, privileges levels, login status, posture status, and so on). It enables assessment of the nature and the potential risk of suspicious activity so that the correct next steps for cyber threats can be taken.

RouterB(config-if)# ip access-group 101 out
!
RouterB(config)# int g0/0/1
RouterB(config-if)# ip access-group 101 out

A. Option A
B. Option B
C. Option C
D. Option D

Answer: D

Explanation
There are two interfaces that are connected to networks “outside” of router B, which are Gi0/0/0 & Gi0/0/1 so we have to apply the ACL to both interfaces with outbound direction.

Question 7
Drag and drop the code snippets from the bottom onto the blanks in the script to convert a Python object into a compact JSON object by removing space characters. Not all options are used.
Make sure to put answers in order they appear.

import json
data = { ... }

obj = json._____________(_____________, ____________)
print(obj)

A. separators=(',', ':')
B. data
C. "loads"
D. "dumps"

Answer: DBA

Explanation
1. “dumps”
2. data
3. separators=(‘,’, ‘:’)

json.dumps() adds spaces in the JSON object. For example:

{'key1': 'default', 'key2': 'none'}
We can create a compact JSON object by removing spaces with “dumps”. It helps save some bytes when sending over the wire:

Question 13
Which action is a LISP ITR responsible for?
A. responding to map-request messages
B. finding EID-to-RLOC mappings
C. accepting registration requests from ETRs
D. forwarding user data traffic

Answer: B

Explanation
Ingress Tunnel Router (ITR) is the device (or function) that is responsible for finding EID-to-RLOC mappings for all traffic destined for LISP-capable sites. After the encapsulation, the original packet become a LISP packet.

Question 14
An engineer modifies the existing ISE guest portal URL to use a static FQDN. Users immediately report that they receive certificate errors when they are redirected to the new page. Which two additional configuration steps are needed to implement the change? (Choose two)
A. Create and sign a new CSR that contains the static FQDN entry
B. Add the FQDN entry under the WLC virtual interface
C. Manually configure the hosts file on each user device
D. Disable HTTPS on the WLC under the Management menu
E. Add a new DNS record to resolve the FQDN to the PSN IP address

Explanation

Question 16
Which JSON script is properly formatted?

Option A

{
 "car":[
 {
  "type":"Ford",
  "color":"red",
  "year":"1998"
 }
]
}
Option B

"truck":[
     {
	"type":"Dodge",
	"color":"blue",
	"year":"2015"
      }
     ]
Option C

[
   "book":{
    "title":"Engineering",
    "grade":"11",
    "edition":"4".
      }
]
Option D

{ "device":
    {[   
       "type":"switch,
       "model":"Catalyst",
       "mac":"00:46:10:06:93:55",
      ]
     }
}

A. Option A
B. Option B
C. Option C
D. Option D

Answer: A

Explanation
A JSON script should start with “{” -> Only Option A and Option D are correct. But Option D is surely not correct as the “switch is written without closing quote. Also another error in Option D is: square bracket [ can only hold a group of values or objects, separated by comma. For example:

"sports": ["volley-ball","badminton"] -> This [] holds a group of values
or

"book": [
{
  "id": "01",
  "language": "Java",
  "edition": "third"
},
{
  "id": "02",
  "language": "C++",
  "edition": "second"
} -> This [] holds a group of objects
But in Option D we see square bracket holds key/value pair which is not correct. Therefore only Option A is correct.

Question 20
Drag and drop the snippets onto the blanks within the code to create an EEM script that adds an entry to a locally stored text file with a timestamp when a configuration change is made. Not all options are used.
Make sure that answers are in the correct order.

event manager applet CONF_CHANGE
_____________ "SYS-5-CONFIG_I"
action 1.0 cli command ____________
action 2.0 cli command "show clock ______________:ConfSave.txt"
action 3.0 syslog Priority information msg "Configuration changed"

A. event cli pattern
B. "conf t"
C. "enable"
D. | append flash
E. event syslog pattern
F. flash
 
Answer: ECD

Explanation
1. event syslog pattern
2. “enable”
3. | append flash

The command “show clock | append flash:ConfSave.txt” means that we want to write the output of the “show clock” command to a file on the flash memory.

Question 21
A customer requires their wireless data traffic to egress at the switch port of the access point. Which access point mode supports this?
A. FlexConnect
B. Sniffer
C. Bridge
D. Monitor

Answer: A

Explanation
FlexConnect AP mode enables switching traffic between an SSID and a VLAN locally if the CAPWAP to the WLC is down, even when the AP is at a remote site. It can also be configured to egress at the access point’s LAN port.

Explanation
The range() function returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default, and increments by 1 (by default), and stops before a specified number.

Question 25
What is a benefit of YANG modules?
A. tightly coupled models with encoding to improve performance
B. easier multivendor interoperability provided by common or industry models
C. avoidance of ecosystem fragmentation by having fixed modules that cannot be changed
D. single protocol and model coupling to simplify maintenance and support

Answer: B

Explanation

Question 27
What is contained in the VXLAN header?
A. VXLAN network identifier
B. source and destination RLOC ID
C. endpoint ID
D. original Layer 2 VLAN ID

Answer: A

Explanation
The key fields for the VXLAN packet in each of the protocol headers are:

+ Outer MAC header (14 bytes with 4 bytes optional) – Contains the MAC address of the source VTEP and the MAC address of the next-hop router. Each router along the packet’s path rewrites this header so that the source address is the router’s MAC address and the destination address is the next-hop router’s MAC address.

+ Outer IP header (20 bytes)- Contains the IP addresses of the source and destination VTEPs.
+ (Outer) UDP header (8 bytes)- Contains source and destination UDP ports:
– Source UDP port: The VXLAN protocol repurposes this standard field in a UDP packet header. Instead of using this field for the source UDP port, the protocol uses it as a numeric identifier for the particular flow between VTEPs. The VXLAN standard does not define how this number is derived, but the source VTEP usually calculates it from a hash of some combination of fields from the inner Layer 2 packet and the Layer 3 or Layer 4 headers of the original frame.
– Destination UDP port: The VXLAN UDP port. The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) allocates port 4789 to VXLAN.

+ VXLAN header (8 bytes)- Contains the 24-bit VXLAN Network Identifiers (VNI).
+ Original Ethernet/L2 Frame – Contains the original Layer 2 Ethernet frame.

Note: In fact this question has two correct answer, which are: VXLAN network identifier and original Layer 2 VLAN ID. But we believe the first answer is better.

Question 30
Which function is performed by vSmart in the Cisco SD-WAN architecture?
A. redistribution between OMP and other routing protocols
B. facilitation of NAT detection and traversal
C. distribution of centralized policies 
D. execution of localized policies

Answer: C

Explanation
Answer A is not correct as it is the role of vEdges. But by default, vEdges do not automatically redistribute OMP routes into any legacy routing protocol. We must explicitly enable the redistribution for each particular local protocol on each vEdge router.

Answer B mentions about vBond while answer D mentions about vEdge.

Question 31
Refer to the exhibit.

R2
IP - 192.168.0.5/30
RID 10.0.0.5
Network Type BROADCAST
State DR, Priority 1
Timers - Hello 10, Dead 40, Wait 40
Neighbor Count 0

R3
IP - 192.168.0.6/29
RID 10.0.0.3
Network Type BROADCAST
State DR, Priority 1
Timers - Hello 10, Dead 40, Wait 40
Neighbor Count 0

Why does the OSPF neighborship fail between the two interfaces?
A. The IP subnet mask is not the same.
B. There is a mismatch in the OSPF interface network type.
C. The OSPF timers are different.
D. The MTU is not the same.

Answer: A

Explanation
OSPF forms neighbor relationship with other OSPF routers on the same segment by exchanging hello packets. The hello packets contain various parameters. Some of them should match between neighboring routers. These include:

+ Hello and Dead intervals
+ Area ID
+ Authentication type and password
+ Stub Area flag
+ Subnet ID and Subnet mask

In this question we see the subnet mask between two neighbors are not matched (/30 & /29) so the OSPF neighborship failed.

Question 32
Refer to the exhibit.

  172.16.250.0/30
R2==============R1
  172.16.250.4/30

C 172.16.0.0/16, 2 subnets
D 172.16.1.0/24 [110/7445] via 172.16.250.1 G0/0
                [110/7445] via 172.16.250.5 G0/4

Clients are reporting an issue with the voice traffic from the branch site to the central site. What is the cause of this issue?
A. The voice traffic is using the link with less available bandwidth
B. There is a high delay on the WAN links
C. There is a routing loop on the network
D. Traffic is load-balancing over both links, causing packets to arrive out of order

Answer: D

Explanation
From the traceroute output, we learn the second link (172.16.250.5) has greater latency than the first link (172.16.250.1) so the packets will arrive out of order when traffic is load-balancing over both links.

Note: Latency (also known as delay) refers to the time it takes a voice packet to reach its destination. Latency is measured in milliseconds (ms) (or thousandths of a second). Latency of 150ms or less (one-way) is generally acceptable. Latency greater than 150ms (again, one way) adversely affects the call quality experience.

Question 33
Refer to the exhibit.

10.1.1.10                               10.1.1.20

SW1(config-access-map)# match ip address DENY-HTTP
SW1 (config-access-map)# action drop
SW1(config)# vlan filter HOST-A-B vlan 10

Option C

SW1(config)# mac access-list extended HOST-A-B
SW1(config-ext-macl)# permit host aaaa.bbbb.cccc aaaa.bbbb.dddd

SW1(config)# ip access-list extended DENY-HTTP
SW1(config-ext-nacl)#deny tcp host 10.1.1.10 host 10.1.1.20 eq www

SW1(config-access-map)# match ip address MATCH_ALL
SW1(config-access-map)# action forward

SW1(config)# vlan filter HOST-A-B vlan 10

A. Option A
B. Option B
C. Option C
D. Option D

Answer: A

Explanation
In this case we need to configure a VLAN access-map to deny HTTP traffic and apply it to VLAN 10. To do it, first create an access-list, by which interesting traffic will be matched. The principle of VLAN access-map config is similar to the route-map principle.

After this we’ll create a vlan access-map, which has two main parameters: action and match.
Match: by this parameter the interesting traffic is matched and here RACL or MAC ACL can be applied as well.
Action: what to do with matched traffic. Two main parameters exist: Drop and Forward. In case of Drop, matched traffic will be dropped, and in case of forward, matched traffic will be allowed.

A good reference and example can be found at https://www.networkstraining.com/vlan-access-map-example-configuration/

In this question, we have to permit both ACL because the matched traffic will be decided by the VLAN Access map below (forward or drop).

Question 34
Which virtualization component creates VMs and performs hardware abstraction that allows multiple VMs to run at the same time?
A. rkt
B. Docker
C. container 
D. hypervisor

Answer: D

Explanation
Hypervisors support the creation and management of virtual machines (VMs) by abstracting a computer’s software from its hardware.

Question 40
An SSID is configured and both clients can reach their gateways on the Layer 3 switch, but they cannot communicate with each other. Which action resolves this issue?
A. Set the P2P Blocking Action to Forward-UpStream.
B. Set the P2P Blocking Action to Disabled
C. Set the WMM Policy to Required.
D. Set the WMM Policy to Allowed.

Answer: B

Explanation
Wi-Fi Multimedia (WMM) is used to prioritize different types of traffic -> It cannot block traffic so it is not a problem of this question.

Peer to peer (P2P) blocking is applied to individual WLANs. You can have traffic bridged locally within the controller, dropped by the controller, or forwarded to the upstream VLAN.

Choose one of the following options from the P2P Blocking drop-down list:

+ Disabled – Disables peer-to-peer blocking and bridges traffic locally within the controller whenever possible.This is the default value.
Note: Traffic is never bridged across VLANs in the controller.
+ Drop – Causes the controller to discard the packets.
+ Forward-UpStream – Causes the packets to be forwarded on the upstream VLAN. The device above the controller decides what action to take regarding the packets.

Reference: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/wireless/controller/7-5/configuration-guide/b_cg75/b_cg75_chapter_01001011.pdf

-> In this question two laptops are in the same VLAN so answer A is not correct. Only answer B is correct.

Question 43
Where is the wireless LAN controller located in a mobility express deployment?
A. There is no wireless LAN controller in the network.
B. The wireless LAN controller is embedded into the access point.
C. The wireless LAN controller exists in the cloud.
D. The wireless LAN controller exists in a server that is dedicated for this purpose.

Answer: B

Explanation
Mobility Express is the ability to use an access point (AP) as a controller instead of a real WLAN controller. But this solution is only suitable for small to midsize, or multi-site branch locations where you might not want to invest in a dedicated WLC. A Mobility Express WLC can support up to 100 APs.

Question 44
What is a characteristic of VXLAN?
A. It uses TCP for transport.
B. It has a 12-byte packet header.
C. It extends Layer 2 and Layer 3 overlay networks over a Layer 2 underlay.
D. It is a multi-tenant solution.

Answer: D

Explanation
VXLAN header consists of 8 bytes and contains the 24-bit VNI -> Answer B is not correct.

VXLAN uses UDP, not TCP -> Answer A is not correct.

VXLAN is often described as an overlay technology because it allows to stretch Layer 2 connections over an intervening Layer 3 network -> Answer C is not correct.

Therefore only answer D is left.

Question 48
Which capability does a distributed virtual switch have?
A. use floating static routes
B. provide configuration consistency across the hosts
C. run dynamic routing protocols
D. use advanced IPsec encryption algorithms

Answer: B

Explanation
Virtual switches are used to connect virtual network controllers of VMs to networks on the second layer of the OSI model.

Standard vSwitches are configured on each ESXi host manually. However, in large virtual environments, virtual switches usually have the same vSwitch configuration, including for port groups, VLANs, connected networks, etc. If you need to add a new port group associated with VLAN to connect VMs on ESXi hosts to that VLAN, you have to configure vSwitch on each ESXi host the same way manually. This is a time-consuming process.

To address this, VMware allows you to use the distributed virtual switch, a logical switch that can be configured on vCenter Server once for several hosts. This means that you don’t have to configure standard virtual switches on each ESXi host manually.

What is a benefit of using segmentation with TrustSec?
A. Integrity checks prevent data from being modified in transit.
B. Packets sent between endpoints on a LAN are encrypted using symmetric key cryptography.
C. Security group tags enable network segmentation.
D. Firewall rules are streamlined by using business-level profiles.

Answer: C

Explanation
Benefits of Segmentation with TrustSec

Security Group Tagging transforms segmentation by simplifying administration:
+ Security group tags allow organizations to segment their networks without having to redesign to accommodate more VLANs and subnets.
+ Firewall rules are dramatically streamlined by using an intuitive business-level profile method.
+ Policy enforcement is automated, assisting compliance and increasing security efficacy.
+ Security auditing becomes much easier, as Qualified Security Assessors can more easily validate that rules are being enforced to meet compliance.

Drag and drop the characteristic from the left onto the orchestration tools that they describe on the right.
Which of the following are about Ansible? (Choose two)
A. Uses playbooks
B. Uses a pull model
C. Procedural
D. Declarative

Answer: AC

Explanation
Ansible:
+ uses playbooks
+ prodedural

Puppet:
+ uses a pull model
+ declarative

In Ansible, Playbooks are files that provide actions and logic about what Ansible should do. Ansible playbooks are files that contain tasks to configure hosts. Ansible playbooks are written in YAML format.

Puppet is based on a Pull deployment model, where the nodes check in regularly after every 1800 seconds with the Master to see if anything needs to be updated in the agent. If anything needs to be updated the agent pulls the necessary Puppet codes from the Master and performs required actions.

Chef and Ansible encourage a procedural style where you write code that specifies, step-by-step, how to to achieve some desired end state. Terraform, SaltStack, and Puppet all encourage a more declarative style where you write code that specifies your desired end state, and the IAC tool itself is responsible for figuring out how to achieve that state.

Authentication servers - Enabled, none set
Accounting servers - Enable, none set
EAP Parameters - Disabled
RADIUS Interim Update - Enabled
Local EAP Auth - Disabled

An engineer must configure a Cisco WLC with WPA2 Enterprise mode and avoid global server lists. Which action is required?
A. Select a RADIUS authentication server
B. Disable the RADIUS server accounting interim update
C. Enable EAP parameters
D. Apply CISCO ISE default settings

Answer: A

Explanation
The “interim update” option is intended to periodically send the accounting data to the RADIUS server (e.g every 60 seconds) -> Answer B is not correct.

If we scroll up a bit in the “AAA Servers” tab, we will see the message “Select AAA servers below to override use of default servers on this WLAN” so we can choose the AAA server in the boxes to avoid default/global server lists -> Answer A is correct.

Question 67
An engineer must configure a multicast UDP jitter operation. Which configuration should be applied?
A. Router(config)#ip sla 1
Router(config)#udp jitter 10.0.0.1 source-ip 192.168.1.1
B. Router(config)#ip sla 1
Router(config)#udp-jitter 192.0.2.115 65051 num-packets 20
C. Router(config)#ip sla 1
Router(config)#udp-jitter 192.0.2.115 65051
D. Router(config)#ip sla 1
Router(config)#udp jitter 239.1.1.1 65051 end-point list List source-ip 192.168.1.1

Answer: D

Explanation
The command “udp jitter 239.1.1.1 65051 end-point list List source-ip 192.168.1.1” configures the IP SLAs operation as a multicast UDP jitter operation and enters multicast UDP jitter configuration mode.

Reference: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/ipsla/configuration/15-mt/sla-15-mt-book/sla_mcast_suppt.html

Note: In fact the correct command should be “Router(config-ip-sla)# udp-jitter 239.1.1.1 65051 endpoint-list List source-ip 192.168.1.1”. Maybe they are unintended typos of this question.

if Response.status_code < 200 or Response.status_code > 299: 
  print(f"Aborting; received status code {Response.status_code}") 
  exit ()

<...removed...>

admin@linux:~$ ./fetch.py 
Aborting; received status code 401

An administrator writes a script to fetch the list of devices that are registered with Cisco DNA Center. Why does the execution abort?

A. The “dna-center” hostname cannot be resolved to an IP address
B. The username or the password is incorrect
C. The TLS certificate of DNA Center is invalid
D. The authentication URL is incorrect

Answer: B

Explanation
From the last line, we see the returned code was 401.

The 401 Unauthorized Error is an HTTP status code error that represented the request sent by the client to the server that lacks valid authentication credentials. It may be represented as 401 Unauthorized, Authorization required, HTTP error 401- Unauthorized. It represents that the request could not be authenticated.

Question 76
When is GLBP preferred over HSRP?
A. When encrypted helm are required between gateways h a single group
B. When the traffic load needs to be shared between multiple gateways using a single virtual IP
C. When the gateway routers are a mix of Cisco and non-Cisco routers
D. When clients need the gateway MAC address lo Be the same between multiple gateways

Answer: B

Explanation
An advantage of GLBP over HSRP, VRRP is GLBP can load-balance traffic without any trick.

Question 77
A network engineer wants to configure console access to a router without using AAA so that the privileged exec mode is entered directly after a user provide the correct login credentials. Which action achieves this goal?
A. Configure login authentication privileged on line con 0
B. Configure a local username with privilege level 15
C. Configure privilege level 15 on line con 0
D. Configure a RADIUS or TACACS+ server and use it to send the privilege level

Answer: C

Explanation
Putting the privilege-level 15 on the console is one way to work around the issue. And it works – as long as you are comfortable with the fact that everyone who logs in on the console will be immediately placed directly into privilege/enable mode.

Reference: https://community.cisco.com/t5/network-access-control/privileged-exec-at-line-con-0/td-p/1705892

We also tested both “login authentication privileged” and “privilege level 15” commands. Only the latter exists:

Question 91
Which two functions is an edge node responsible for? (Choose two)
A. provides multiple entry and exit points for fabric traffic
B. provides the default exit point for fabric traffic
C. provides the default entry point for fabric traffic
D. provides a host database that maps endpoint IDs to a current location
E. authenticates endpoints

Answer: AE

Explanation
From below reference, we learn that answer D is not correct as the Control node (not Edge node) is a simple Host Database that maps Endpoint IDs to a current Location, along with other attributes.

Also from below reference, we can see the functions of Edge Node (page 34):

Edge Node provides first-hop services for Users / Devices connected to a Fabric

+ Responsible for Identifying and Authenticating Endpoints (e.g. Static, 802.1X, Active Directory) -> Answer E is correct
+ Register specific Endpoint ID info (e.g. /32 or /128) with the Control-Plane Node(s)
+ Provide an Anycast L3 Gateway for the connected Endpoints (same IP address on all Edge nodes)
+ Performs encapsulation / de-encapsulation of data traffic to and from all connected Endpoints

Reference: https://www.ciscolive.com/c/dam/r/ciscolive/us/docs/2019/pdf/BRKCRS-2818.pdf

Also from above reference, we also learn Border Node is the “default” exit if no entry is available in Control-Plane (“Gateway of Last Resort” for any unknown destinations) -> Answer B and answer C are not correct.

Therefore only answer A is left.

Question 93
Which configuration filters out DOT1X messages in the format shown below from being sent toward Syslog server 10.15.20.33?

Nov 20 13:47:32.553: %DOT1X-5-FAIL: Authentication failed for client (e04f.438e.de4f) on Interface Gi1/0/1 AuditSessionID OAQB50A5000004543910739E

A. logging discriminator DOT1X facility drops DOT1X
logging host 10.15.20.33 discriminator DOT1X

B. logging discriminator DOT1X msg-body drops DOTX
logging host 10.15.20.33 discriminator DOTX

C. logging discriminator DOT1X mnemonics includes DOTX
logging host 10.15.20.33 discriminator DOT1X

D. logging discriminator DOT1X mnemonics includes DOT1X
logging host 10.15.20.33 discriminator DOTX

Answer: A

Explanation
The “logging discriminator DOT1X facility drops DOT1X” command creates a logging message filter that drops log messages with a specific facility of “DOT1X”.

Here’s a breakdown of the command:

+ logging discriminator DOT1X: This command creates a logging message discriminator named “DOT1X” which can be used to filter specific types of log messages.

+ facility drops DOT1X: This option tells the discriminator to drop log messages that have a facility of “DOT1X”. Facilities are used to group log messages based on the type of device or process that generated them.

Overall, this command creates a logging message filter that drops log messages with a facility of “DOT1X”. Any log messages that have this facility will not be saved to the router’s log buffer.

This command could be useful in situations where a large number of log messages are generated by the 802.1X authentication process and these messages are not required for troubleshooting or auditing purposes. By dropping these messages, the router’s log buffer can be conserved and the visibility of other log messages can be improved.

Question 98
Refer to the exhibit.

Coverage Hole Detection - Enabled
Aironet IE - Enabled
Layer 2 ACL - None
URL ACL - None
P2P Blocking - Disabled
MFP Client Protection - Optional
DTIM Period
a/n - 1
b/g/n - 1
NAC State - ISE NAC

An engineer is troubleshooting an issue with client devices triggering excessive power changes on APs in the 2.4 GHz band. Which action resolves this issue?
A. Disable Coverage Hole Detection
B. Disable Aironet IE
C. Set the 802.11 b/g/n DTIM interval to 0
D. Enable MFP Client Protection

Answer: A

Explanation
Coverage Hole Detection is a feature that detects areas with poor wireless coverage and may trigger power changes on APs to improve coverage. Disabling it would prevent the APs from making these adjustments, which could stabilize the power levels.

MFP Client Protection is used to protect against clients connecting to a rogue access point only -> Answer D is not correct.

From the exhibit, we see that DTIM Period ranges from 1 to 255 so we cannot set it to 0 -> Answer C is not correct.

“Aironet IE” option means “Aironet IE Extension”. This extension help clients choose the best access point. But it does not relate to our question.

Why does the vBond orchestrator have a public IP?
A. to allow for global reachability from all WAN Edges in the Cisco SD-WAN and to facilitate NAT traversal
B. to provide access to Cisco Smart Licensing servers for license enablement
C. to enable vBond to learn the public IP of WAN Edge devices that are behind NAT gateways or in private address space
D. to facilitate downloading and distribution of operational and security patches

Answer: A

Explanation
SD-WAN Validator – This software-based component performs the initial authentication of WAN Edge devices and orchestrates SD-WAN Controller, Manager, and WAN Edge connectivity. It also has an important role in enabling the communication between devices that sit behind Network Address Translation (NAT).

Reference: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/solutions/CVD/SDWAN/cisco-sdwan-design-guide.html

The major components of the Cisco SD-WAN Validator are:

…

NAT traversal: The Cisco SD-WAN Validator facilitates the initial orchestration between edge routers and Cisco SD-WAN Controllers when one or both of them are behind NAT devices.

Reference: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/routers/sdwan/configuration/sdwan-xe-gs-book/system-overview.html

Note: Cisco SD-WAN has been rebranded to Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN. As part of this rebranding, the vManage name has been changed to SD-WAN Manager, the vSmart name has been changed to SD-WAN Controller, and the vBond name has been changed to SD-WAN Validator.


Question 3
A network engineer must configure the VTY lines on a router to achieve these results:

+ Remote access should be permitted only for secure protocols.
+ Only a password should be required for device authentication.
+ All idle EXEC sessions must be terminated in 60 minutes.

Which configuration should be applied?

Option A
line vty 0 15 
 login
 password Cisco123 
 transport input all 
 exec-timeout 60

Option B

Option D
line vty 0 15
 password Cisco123 
 transport input telnet ssh 
 exec-timeout 60

A. Option A
B. Option B
C. Option C
D. Option D

Answer: B

Explanation
From the requirement “Remote access should be permitted only for secure protocols” we can immediately figure out only Option B is correct as it only allows SSH connection with the “transport input ssh” command.

Question 6
Refer to the exhibit.

R1
Track 26 interface S0/0.1 line-protocol
Int g0/0
Ip address 10.10.10.2 255.255.255.0
Standby 100 ip 10.10.10.1
Standby 100 priority 105
Standby 100 preempt
Standby 100 track 26

R2
Int g0/0
Ip address 10.10.10.3 255.255.255.0
Standby 100 ip 10.10.10.1

An engineer must modify the existing configuration so that R2 can take over as the primary router when serial interface 0/0.1 on R1 goes down. Which command must the engineer apply?
A. R2# standby 100 preempt
B. R2# standby 100 priority 100
C. R2# standby 100 track 26 decrement 10
D. R2# track 26 interface Serial0/0.1 line-protocol

Answer: A

Explanation
This is a tricky question as we cannot apply any command about “track 26” on R2 as it only decrease the HSRP priority on R2. We need the “standby 10o preempt” command to take over the primary router because R1 is tracking S0/0.1 interface already. When this interface goes down, R1’s HSRP priority will decrease by 10 which is smaller than that of R2.

Question 7
Refer to the exhibit.

from ncclient import manager

netconf_host = manager.connect(host='ios-xe-example.com',
				port=22,
				username='cisco',    
				password='cisco',
				hostkey_verify=False, 
				device_params={'name':'iosxe'})
print (netconf_host.get_config('running'))
netconf_host.close_session()

An engineer deploys a script to retrieve the running configuration from a NETCONF-capable Cisco IOS XE device that is configured with default settings. The script falls. Which configuration must be applied to retrieve the configuration using NETCONF?
A. print (netconf_host.get_config(‘show running’))
B. port=830
C. device_params={‘name’:’ ios-xe’})
D. hostkey_verify=True,

Answer: B

Explanation
Port 830 listens for NETCONF over SSH connections so we need to connect via this port, not port 22.

Question 10
A customer requires their wireless network to be fully functional, even if the wireless controller fails. Which wireless design supports these requirements?
A. FlexConnect
B. mesh
C. centralized
D. embedded

Answer: A

Explanation
FlexConnect, formerly known as Hybrid Remote Edge AP (H-REAP), mode: allows data traffic to be switched locally and not go back to the controller. The FlexConnect AP can perform standalone client authentication and switch VLAN traffic locally even when it’s disconnected to the WLC (Local Switched).

Question 12
Refer to the exhibit.

WLAN
Layer 2 Security - WPA + WPA2
Mac Filtering - Disabled
PMF - Disabled
WPA2 Policy - Enabled
Encryption - AES
Auth Key Mgmt - None
MPSK - Disabled
Fast Transition - Disabled

Which action must be taken to configure a WLAN for WPA2-AES with PSK and allow only 802.11r-capable clients to connect?
A. Enable Fast Transition and FT + PSK.
B. Enable Fast Transition and PSK
C. Change Fast Transition to Adaptive Enabled and enable FT +PSK.
D. Enable PSK and FT + PSK.

Answer: A

Explanation
Cisco created a proprietary method known as “Adaptive FT” to workaround the issue of incompatible Apple devices not being able to associate to 802.11r enabled WLANs -> Answer C is not correct.

“Pure mode” sets a hard requirement on the wireless network in that clients that connect must support Fast Transition. Clients that do not support Fast Transition will not be able to connect at all. For WPA2-PSK networks, select “FT + PSK”.

Note: Answer D is the “mixed mode”. For this mode, in the beacon/probe response sent out by the AP towards the client devices, both the non-FT 802.11x and FT 802.11x authentication methods are announced and the client can choose which one it wants to use.

ip nat inside source static 10.10.10.10 10.0.3.10

Which address type is 10.10.10.10 configured for?
A. outside global
B. inside global
C. outside local
D. inside local

Answer: D

Explanation
The syntax of this command is: Router(config)# ip nat inside source static [inside_local_address [inside_global_address].

Therefore the inside local IP address 10.10.10.10 will be translated to 10.0.3.10 when it is sent out from the router.

Question 14
Which function does a virtual switch provide?
A. RAID storage for virtual machines
B. connectivity between virtual machines
C. CPU context switching for multitasking between virtual machines
D. emulation of power for virtual machines

Answer: B

Explanation
Hypervisors provide virtual switch (vSwitch) that Virtual Machines (VMs) use to communicate with other VMs on the same host. The vSwitch may also be connected to the host’s physical NIC to allow VMs to get layer 2 access to the outside world.

Question 15

To configure a Cisco device as an Authoritative NTP Server, use the ntp master [stratum] command. An Authoritative NTP Server can distribute time even when it is not synchronized to an existing time server.

Question 19
Refer to the exhibit.

R2(config)#event manager applet script_1
R2(config-applet)#action 1 cli command "enable"
R2(config-applet)#action 2 cli command "config t"
R2(config-applet)#action 3 cli command "interface ge0/0"
R2(config-applet)#action 4 cli command "ip add 172.16.1.1 255.255.255.0" 
R2(config-applet)#action 5 cli command "no sh"
R2(config-applet)#action 6 cli command "end"
R2(config-applet)#exit

An engineer must create a manually triggered EEM applet to enable the R2 router interface and assign an IP address to it. What is required to complete this configuration?
A. R2(config-applet)#action 4 cli command “ip add 172.16.1.1 0.0.0.255”
B. R2(config)# event manager session cli username
C. R2(config-applet)# event oir
D. R2(config-applet)# event none sync yes

Answer: D

Explanation
If you want to manually run the EEM applet, use the “event none” command. “sync yes” means “run the commands synchronously”. In other words, “run each command and wait until it is executed then run the next one”.

Question 20
What is stateful switchover?
A. cluster protocol used to facilitate switch failover
B. mechanism to take control from a failed RP while maintaining connectivity
C. mechanism used to prevent routing protocol loops during an RP switchover
D. First Hop Redundancy Protocol for host gateway connectivity

Answer: B

Explanation
Stateful switchover (SSO) establishes one of the supervisor engines as active while the other supervisor engine is designated as standby, and then SSO synchronizes information between them. A switchover from the active to the redundant supervisor engine occurs when the active supervisor engine fails, or is removed from the switch, or is manually shut down for maintenance.

Question 27

Refer to the exhibit.

R1#show policy-map control-plane
Control Plane

Service-policy input: CoPP
  Class-map: telnet_copp (match-all)
   33 packets, 1998 bytes

  20 permit tcp any any eq 22 (2 matches)
  30 deny tcp host 10.0.0.5 any eq telnet (18 matches) 
  40 permit tcp any any eq telnet (31 matches)

Which result is achieved by the CoPP configuration?
A. Traffic that matches entry 10 of ACL 100 is always dropped.
B. Class-default traffic is dropped.
C. Traffic that matches entry 10 of ACL 100 is always allowed with a limited CIR.
D. Traffic that matches entry 10 of ACL 100 is always allowed.

Answer: D

Explanation
Packets that match a deny rule are excluded from that class and cascade to the next class (if one exists) for classification. This is in contrast to packets matching a permit rule, which are then included in that class and no further comparisons are performed. Let’s see an example:

ip access-list extended CoPP_Telnet
 deny tcp host 192.168.1.1 any eq telnet      ! Allow this traffic unconstrained
 permit tcp any any eq telnet                 ! Rate-limit this traffic
!
class-map Telnet_class
 match access-group name CoPP_Telnet
!
policy-map CoPP_Telnet_policy
 class Telnet_class
  police cir 8000
   conform-action transmit
   exceed-action drop
!
control-plane
 service-policy input CoPP_Telnet_policy
!
This CoPP allows host with source address of 192.168.1.1 to forward Telnet packets to the control plane without constraint while all remaining Telnet packets are policed at the specified rate. A strange thing here is we have to “deny” source 192.168.1.1 in the ACL so that it is excluded from “class-map Telnet_class”. It will be matched by the “class-default” which is implemented implicitly at the end of the policy-map. This default class will match all the traffic and allows them by default.

Question 32
Which function is performed by vSmart in the Cisco SD-WAN architecture?
A. redistribution between OMP and other routing protocols
B. facilitation of NAT detection and traversal
C. aggregation and distribution of VPN routing information
D. execution of localized policies

Answer: C

Explanation
Answer A is not correct as it is the role of vEdges. But by default, vEdges do not automatically redistribute OMP routes into any legacy routing protocol. We must explicitly enable the redistribution for each particular local protocol on each vEdge router.

Answer B mentions about vBond while answer D mentions about vEdge.

Question 35
An engineer must use flexible NetFlow on a group of switches. To prevent overloading of the flow collector, if the flow is idle for 20 seconds, the flow sample should be exported. Which command set should be applied?

Option A
flow record recordflow 
 exporter flowexport
 record recordflow
 cache timeout active 120 
 cache timeout inactive 20 
 cache type immediate

Option B
flow monitor monitorflow
 exporter flowexport
 record recordflow
 cache timeout active 120 
 cache timeout inactive 20 
 cache type immediate

Option C
flow monitor monitorflow 
 exporter recordflow 
 cache timeout active 20 
 cache timeout inactive 120 
 cache type permanent

Option D
flow record recordflow
 match ipv6 destination ip-address 
 match ipv6 source ip-address 
 match ipv6 protocol-type view 
 match interface input 
 match interface output 
 match transport destination-port 
 collect counter bytes long

A. Option A
B. Option B
C. Option C
D. Option D

Answer: B

Explanation
“if the flow is idle for 20 seconds, the flow sample should be exported” -> We need to use the “cache timeout inactive 20” command.

+ “cache type permanent”: This command specifies the permanent cache type. This type of cache never ages out any flows.

+ “cache type immediate”: This command specifies the immediate cache type. This type of cache will age out every record as soon as it is created, with the result that every flow contains just one packet.

-> Therefore we need to use the “cache type permanent” with the “cache timeout inactive 20” to age out a flow if it has not seen any activity for 20 seconds. Maybe there is a typo in this question as none of the answers has both commands. But Option B is the best answer as these commands are used in “flow monitor”, not “flow record”.

Question 36
When a branch location loses connectivity, which Cisco FlexConnect state rejects new users but allows existing users to function normally?
A. Authentication-Down / Switch-Local
B. Authentication-Down / Switching-Down
C. Authentication-Central / Switch-Local
B. Authentication-Local / Switch-Local

Answer: A

Explanation
authentication down, local switching—In this state, the WLAN rejects any new clients trying to authenticate, but it continues sending beacon and probe responses to keep existing clients alive. This state is valid only in standalone mode.

VTEPs connect between Overlay and Underlay network and they are responsible for encapsulating frame into VXLAN packets to send across IP network (Underlay) then decapsulating when the packets leaves the VXLAN tunnel.

Question 57
Refer to the exhibit.

Elevation
Two ovals

Azimuth
Circle

Which antenna emits this radiation pattern?
A. omnidirectional
B. RP-TNC
C. dish
D. Yagi

Answer: A

Explanation
These Omnidirectional antennas have a doughnut shaped radiation pattern and are ideal for connecting devices that are on the same plane and to either side of each other. These are commonly misused in in-building and mobile applications. In mobile applications, Omnidirectional Dipole Antennas fail to have the proper patterning needed in order to connect to a tower that is on a much higher elevation. In in-building applications, Omnidirectional Dipole Antennas fail specifically in point to multipoint deployments where the user can be standing directly underneath a transmitting antenna, and be in a dead zone.

Reference: https://www.mpantenna.com/omnidirectional-antenna-radiation-patterns/

Question 63
In a campus network design, what are two benefits of using BFD for failure detection? (Choose two)
A. BFD is an efficient way to reduce memory and CPU usage.
B. BFD speeds up routing convergence time.
C. BFD provides path failure detection in less than a second.
D. BFD enables network peers to continue forwarding packets in the event of a restart.
E. BFD provides fault tolerance by enabling multiple routers to appear as a single virtual router.

Answer: BC

Explanation
BFD (Bidirectional Forwarding Detection) is a super-fast protocol that is able to detect link failures within milliseconds or even microseconds -> Answer C is correct.

While BGP can detect route failures, BFD can be configured to detect these failures more quickly, which allows for faster responses and improved convergence -> Answer B is correct.

Question 74
Which action is the vSmart controller responsible for in an SD-WAN deployment?
A. onboard vEdge nodes into the SD-WAN fabric
B. distribute security information for tunnel establishment between vEdge routers
C. manage, maintain, and gather configuration and status for nodes within the SD-WAN fabric
D. gather telemetry data from vEdge routers

Answer: B

Explanation
+ Orchestration plane (vBond) assists in securely onboarding the SD-WAN WAN Edge routers into the SD-WAN overlay (-> Therefore answer A mentioned about vBond). The vBond controller, or orchestrator, authenticates and authorizes the SD-WAN components onto the network. The vBond orchestrator takes an added responsibility to distribute the list of vSmart and vManage controller information to the WAN Edge routers. vBond is the only device in SD-WAN that requires a public IP address as it is the first point of contact and authentication for all SD-WAN components to join the SD-WAN fabric. All other components need to know the vBond IP or DNS information.

+ Management plane (vManage) is responsible for central configuration and monitoring. The vManage controller is the centralized network management system that provides a single pane of glass GUI interface to easily deploy, configure, monitor and troubleshoot all Cisco SD-WAN components in the network. (-> Answer C and answer D are about vManage)

+ Control plane (vSmart) builds and maintains the network topology and make decisions on the traffic flows. The vSmart controller disseminates control plane information between WAN Edge devices, implements control plane policies and distributes data plane policies to network devices for enforcement (-> Answer B is about vSmart)

Question 78
Which version of NetFlow does Cisco Threat Defense utilize to obtain visibility into the network?
A. NBAR2
B. IPFIX
C. 8

Question 82
Refer to the exhibit.

Request URL: https://www.cisco.com/libs/granite/csrf/token.json
Request Method: GET
Status Code: 403
Remote Address: 23.207.65.173:443
Referrer Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin

Why was the response code generated?
A. The resource was unreachable
B. Access was denied based on the user permissions.
C. The resource 15 no longer available on the server.
D. There is a conflict in the current state of the resource.

Answer: B

Explanation
Status code 403 means “Forbidden”, which means “access was denied” -> Answer B is correct.

For your information, Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is an HTTP mechanism that allows resource sharing from one origin to another origin securely.

Two URLs would be considered to be having different origins when they have different protocols, ports (if specified), or hosts.

For example, making a request from https://domain-a.com to https://domain-b.com/api-1 is considered cross-origin as they have different hostnames.

Internet browsers follow the same-origin policy and restrict cross-origin HTTP requests initiated from scripts. This means that a website is only allowed to make requests to the same origin unless the response from other origins includes the right CORS headers.

Question 83
An engineer must configure interface and sensor monitoring on a router. The NMS server is located in a trusted zone with IP address 10.15.2.19. Communication between the router and the NMS server must be encrypted and password-protected using the most secure algorithms. Access must be allowed only for the NMS server and with the minimum permission levels needed. Which configuration must the engineer apply?

Option A

ip access-list extended nms 
  permit 1 host 10.15.2.19 any

 snmp-server view ro internet included

 snmp-server view ro ifEntry included

 snmp server group nms v3 priv notify ro access nms
  snmp-server user user1 nms v3 encrypted auth md5 Password1 pri 3des Password123

Option B
ip access-list standard nms
  permit 10.15.2.19 0.0.0.0

 snmp-server view ro iso included

 snmp-server view ro ifEntry included

 snmp server group nms v3 priv read ro access nms
  snmp-server user user1 nms v3 auth sha Password1 pri aes 256 Password123

Option C
ip access-list standard nms 
  permit 10.15.2.19 0.0.0.0

 snmp-server view rw iso included

 snmp server view rw ifEntry included

snmp-server group nms v3 auth write rw access nms
 snmp server user user1 nms v3 auth des Password1 pri des Password123

Option D
ip access list standard nms 
  permit 10.15.2.19 255.255.255.255

 snmp server view ro cisco included

 snmp server view ro ifEntry included 

 snmp-server group nms v3 priv read ro access nms
  snmp server user user1 nms v3 auth 3des Password1 pri aes 192 Password123

A. Option A
B. Option B
C. Option C
D. Option D

Answer: B

Explanation
“The NMS server must be encrypted and password-protected using the most secure algorithms” -> Option A and Option C are not correct as they are using MD5 and DES (Data Encryption Standard).

Option D is not correct as the access-list must use the wildcard mask, not subnet mask in “permit 10.15.2.19 255.255.255.255” statement.

-> Only Option B is correct. Option B is also using SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm) and AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) which are the most secure algorithms so far.

Question 84
Refer to the exhibit.

Router# configure terminal 
Router(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/1
Router(config-if)#ip address 10.0.0.3 255.255.255.0 
Router(config-if)# standby 512 ip 10.0.0.1

An engineer attempts to configure standby group 512 on interface GigabitEthernet0/1, but the configuration is not accepted. Which command resolves this problem?
A. standby version 2
B. standby 512 preempt
C. standby redirects
D. standby 512 priority 100

Answer: A

Explanation
The group number range is from 0 to 255 for HSRP version 1 and from 0 to 4095 for HSRP version 2 so we must change to version 2 to use group 512.

Question 86
Which mechanism does OAuth use to strengthen REST API security when compared to BasicAuth?
A. Token
B. SSL
C. Authentication
D. TLS

Answer: A

Explanation
Auth0 generates access tokens for API authorization scenarios, in JSON web token (JWT) format. The permissions represented by the access token, in OAuth terms, are known as scopes. When an application authenticates with Auth0, it specifies the scopes it wants. If those scopes are authorized by the user, then the access token will represent these authorized scopes.

*Sep 11 11:00:12.520: DHCPD: relay information option exists, but giaddr is zero.

The CPE router acts as a DHCP server for the locally attached LAN. After DHCP snooping is enabled on the switch where the DHCP clients are connected, clients are unable to obtain their configuration from the DHCP server. What is the cause of this issue?
A. The IP address of the DHCP server is in the excluded DHCP range.
B. The configuration of Gi0/1 is missing the ip helper-address 192.168.255.1 command.
C. The DHCP server drops DHCP packets carrying Option 82 and an empty relay agent IP address.
D. The excluded DHCP range contains the subnet address of the entire LAN network.

Answer: C

Explanation
To solve this problem, we can add the global command ip dhcp relay information trust-all on the DHCP server CPE. This will instruct CPE to accept DHCP requests with a zero giaddr.

The web server is configured to listen only to TCP port 8080 for all HTTP requests. Which command is required to allow Internet users to access the web server on HTTP port 80?
A. ip nat outside source static tcp 10.1.1.100 8080 10.1.1.100 80
B. ip nat inside source static tcp 10.1.1.100 80 10.1.1.100 8080
C. ip nat inside source static tcp 10.1.1.100 8080 10.1.1.100 80
D. ip nat outside source static tcp 10.1.1.100 80 10.1.1.100 8080

Answer: C

Explanation
From the Internet side, users request HTTP with port 80: Outside port is 80
This question said the web server only listens on port 8080: Inside port is 8080

The syntax of this command is “ip nat inside source static tcp {inside-ip} [inside-port] {outside-ip} [outside-port]” so answer A is correct.

The purpose of this command  is to translate packets on the inside interface with a source IP address of 10.1.1.100 and port 8080 to the IP address 10.1.1.100 with port 80. This also implies that any packet received on the outside interface with a destination address of 10.1.1.100:8080 has the destination translated to 10.1.1.100:80.

We can find the same scenario at: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/network-address-translation-nat/13772-12.html#toc-hId–907557791 where the internal web server is configured to listen to TCP port 8080.

A. It counts JSON data from a website.
B. It loads JSON data into an HTTP request.
C. It reads JSON data into a formatted list.
D. It converts JSON data to an HTML document.

Answer: C

Explanation
First the variable bp is created as an empty list “bp= []”. Then we append the bad IPs into this list with a “for” loop. At the end of this code, bp may look like this: bp = [‘100.11.1.1’, ‘201.89.23.33’, ‘89.90.28.34’,…]

Which configuration causes the traffic from PC-1 to the internet to use the link between CoreSW-1 and CoreSW-2 when both switches are up?

A.CoreSW-2(config)# interface vlan 10
CoreSW-2(config-if)# standby 10 priority 100

B.CoreSW-1(config)# interface vlan 10
CoreSW-1(config-if)# standby 10 priority 90

C.CoreSW-2(config)# interface vlan 10
CoreSW-2(config-if)# standby 10 priority 110

D.CoreSW-1(config)# interface vlan 10
CoreSW-1(config-if)# standby 10 priority 100

Answer: C

Explanation
From the “show spanning-tree vlan 10” command on both switches, we learn that CoreSw-1 is the root bridge for VLAN 10 so all traffic in this VLAN must flow to it. Therefore we must make the CoreSw-2 the primary HSRP router so that traffic will be forwarded to CoreSw-1 before sending to the Internet -> We need to set the HSRP priority to a value that is higher than 100 on CoreSW-2.

access-list 101 permit ip any any

A. Option A
B. Option B
C. Option C
D. Option D
E. Option E

Answer: AD

Explanation
MAYBE????
Maybe something is wrong in this question as the direction of the ACL applied to Gi0/0 interface is not correct. All the ACL statements have 10.0.2.0/24 as the source address so we must apply the ACL on the inbound direction of the WAN interface or outbound direction of the LAN interface -> Both Option A and Option B are not correct but we have to choose either of them because three other Options are just ACL statements. We should choose to block the WAN interface as it is closer to the source -> Option A is better.

In the three Options left, Option D is the best choice as it totally blocks FTP connection.

Question 19

C. Option C
D. Option D

Answer: A

Explanation

The purpose of the command “ip nat inside source static tcp 192.168.10.17 192.168.27.42” is to translate packets on the inside interface with a source IP address of 192.168.10.17 to the IP address 192.168.27.42 -> Gi0/1 interface should be “ip nat inside” (not “pat”) -> Option A is correct.

Question 28
Which type of roaming event occurs when a client roams across multiple mobility groups?
A. Layer 1
B. Layer 7
C. Layer 3
D. Layer 2

Answer: C

Explanation
A Mobility Group is a collection of Wireless LAN Controllers (WLCs) that work together to provide seamless wireless roaming for clients. Each Mobility Group consists of one or more WLCs, and when a client roams from one Mobility Group to another, it’s called Inter-Mobility Group Roaming.

The controller supports seamless roaming across multiple mobility groups. During seamless roaming, the client maintains its IP address across all mobility groups. When a client crosses a mobility group boundary during a roam, the client is fully authenticated, but the IP address is maintained, and mobility tunneling is initiated for Layer 3 roaming.

B. Open CAPWAP UDP ports 5246 and 5247 in the network firewall
C. Enable the UDP Lite feature on the WLC.
D. Ensure that the controller is connected to a AAA server

Answer: B

Explanation
CAPWAP uses UDP ports 5246 (control channel) and 5247 (data channel) so we must open these ports first.

Question 30

Question 31
A client requests a wireless solution for remote branch offices to eliminate the need for a local controller at each branch. The branch users require local termination in a specific VLAN for local internet breakout. Which solution must be deployed?
A. central switched
B. FlexConnect local switching
C. auto-anchor mobility
D. asymmetric tunneling

Answer: B

Explanation
+ FlexConnect mode, formerly known as Hybrid Remote Edge AP (H-REAP), mode: allows data traffic to be switched locally and not go back to the controller if the CAPWAP to the WLC is down. The FlexConnect AP can perform standalone client authentication and switch VLAN traffic locally even when it’s disconnected to the WLC (Local Switched). FlexConnect AP can also tunnel (via CAPWAP) both user wireless data and control traffic to a centralized WLC (Central Switched). The AP can locally switch traffic between a VLAN and SSID when the CAPWAP tunnel to the WLC is down.

Question 44
How does a WLC achieve stateful switchover for APs and clients?
A. The active WLC establishes a CAPWAP tunnel to the AP, and the standby WLC establishes a LWAPP tunnel to the AP
B. The active WLC establishes a CAPWAP tunnel with the AP, and the standby WLC copies the AP database and the client database from the active WLC
C. The active WLC establishes a CAPWAP tunnel with the AP and standby WLC to share the AP database information
D. The active and standby WLCs establish separate CAPWAP tunnels to the AP

Answer: B

Explanation
This guide provides information on the theory of operation and configuration for the Cisco Unified Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) as it pertains to supporting stateful switchover of access points and clients (AP and Client SSO).

The new High Availability (HA) feature (that is, AP SSO) set within the Cisco Unified Wireless Network software release version 8.0 and above allows the access point (AP) to establish a CAPWAP tunnel with the Active WLC and share a mirror copy of the AP database with the Standby WLC. The APs do not go into the Discovery state when the Active WLC fails and the Standby WLC takes over the network as the Active WLC.

There is only one CAPWAP tunnel maintained at a time between the APs and the WLC that is in an Active state.

Reference: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/wireless/controller/technotes/8-7/High_Availability_DG.html

Note: The underlined sentence is a bit unclear. It should say “… the Active WLC shares a mirror copy of the AP database with the Standby WLC”.

B. The router will use 172.16.1.1 as the source for NTP packets
C. The router is allowed to receive NTP broadcast packets
D. The router will function as an authoritative NTP server

Answer: D

Explanation
The “ntp source …” command allows you to define the interface to be used as the source interface for generating NTP traffic. By default, the router normally uses the interface closest to the destination as the source interface.

With the ntp master [stratum] command, this device is configured as an Authoritative NTP Server.

Question 60
Which mechanism can be used to enforce network access authentication against an AAA server if the endpoint does not support the 802.1X supplicant functionality?
A. private VLANs
B. port security
C. MAC Authentication Bypass
D. MACsec

Answer: C

Explanation
802.1x is a great way to protect your network by authenticating everything you connect to your switch ports, However, one disadvantage of 802.1X is that your end devices have to support it. If you can’t use 802.1X but still want to secure your switch ports somehow, you can use MAC Authentication Bypass (MAB).

When you enable MAB on a switchport, the switch drops all frames except for the first frame to learn the MAC address. Pretty much any frame can be used to learn the MAC address except for CDP, LLDP, STP, and DTP traffic. Once the switch has learned the MAC address, it contacts an authentication server (RADIUS) to check if it permits the MAC address.

!
tacacs server prod 
address ipv4 10.10.10.23 
key cisco123
!
ip tacacs source-interface Gig 0/0

Which configuration must be applied for the TACACS+ server to grant access-level rights to remote users?
A. R1(config)# aaa authorization exec default group tacacs+
B. R1(config)# aaa authorization exec default local if-authenticated
C. R1(config)# aaa authentication login enable
D. R1(config)# aaa accounting commands 15 default start-stop group tacacs+

Answer: A

Explanation
“grant access-level rights” -> we must use “authorization”
“applied for the TACACS+ server” -> our command must have “tacacs+” keyword

Question 66
A wireless network engineer must configure a WPA2+WPA3 policy with the Personal security type. Which action meets this requirement?
A. Configure the GCMP256 encryption cipher.
B. Configure the CCMP256 encryption cipher.
C. Configure the CCMP128 encryption cipher.
D. Configure the GCMP128 encryption cipher.

Answer: C

Explanation
CCMP (Counter/CBC-MAC Protocol)

The Counter/CBC-MAC Protocol (CCMP) is considered more secure than TKIP. CCMP consists of two algorithms:

+ AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) counter mode encryption.
+ Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code (CBC-MAQ used as a message integrity check (MIC).

The WPA3 Personal stills support AES. WPA3 uses AES-128 for message encryption in Personal and 192 bits in Enterprise

Devices that support CCMP have the WPA2 designation.

Note:

GCMP (Galois/Counter Mode Protocol)

The Galois/Counter Mode Protocol (GCMP) is a cryptographic protocol that provides confidentiality and integrity for data in wireless networks. It is used in the IEEE 802.11 i standard for wireless security, and is also supported by some other wireless networking standards.

GCMP is an authenticated encryption suite that is more secure and more efficient than CCMP. GCMP consists of two algorithms:

+ AES counter mode encryption.
+ Galois Message Authentication Code (GMAQ used as a message integrity check (MIC).

GCMP is used in WPA3.

Question 69A
Drag and drop the characteristics from the left onto the corresponding switching architectures on the right.
Which of these are characteristics of the RIB? (Choose two)
A. It is known as CEF
B. It is used to make destination prefix-based switching decisions
C. Each routing protocol has its own information base
D. It is built form information obtained form dynamic routing protocols and connected and static routes

Answer: CD

Explanation
RIB:
+ Each routing protocol has its own information base
+ It is built from information obtained from dynamic routing protocols and connected and static routes

FIB:
+ It is known as CEF
+ It is used to make destination prefix-based switching decision

Each routing protocol like OSPF, EIGRP has its own Routing information base (RIB) and they select their best candidates to try to install to global RIB so that it can then be selected for forwarding. In order to view the RIB table, use the command “show ip ospf database” for OSPF, “show ip eigrp topology” for EIGRP or “show ip bgp” for BGP. To view the Forwarding Information Base (FIB), use the “show ip cef” command. RIB is in Control plane while FIB is in Data plane.

The Forwarding Information Base (FIB) contains destination reachability information as well as next hop information. This information is then used by the router to make forwarding decisions. The FIB allows for very efficient and easy lookups. Below is an example of the FIB table:

The FIB maintains next-hop address information based on the information in the IP routing table (RIB). In other words, FIB is a mirror copy of RIB.

RIB is in Control plane (and it is not used for forwarding) while FIB is in Data plane (and it is used for forwarding).

Answer: A

Explanation

Question 81
Which encoding is used to protect a username and login with RESTful API basic authentication?
A. Type-7
B. SHA-1
C. MD5
D. Base64

Answer: D

Explanation
Basic authentication is a simple authentication scheme built into the HTTP protocol. The client sends HTTP requests with the “Authorization” header containing the word “Basic”, a space character, and a “username:password” string encoded in Base64.

For example, to authorize the user “demo” with password “p@55w0rd” the client sends:

Authorization: Basic ZGVtbzpwQDU1dzByZA==
In this example, the ZGVtbzpwQDU1dzByZA== string results from encoding the string demo:p@55w0rd in Base64.

Question 82
Drag and drop the code snippets from the bottom onto blanks in the Python script so that the program changes the IP address and saves it as a new JSON file on the disk. Not all options are used.

Import json
With open("json_ios_xe.json", "r") as json_file:
json_file_content = json_file.__________()

deconded_json = json.___________(json_file_content)

decoded_json['Cisco-IOS-XE-native:interface']['Gig'][0]['ip'] =¥ "192.168.1.12"

encoded_json_compact = json.__________(decoded_json)
encoded_json_indented = json.dumps(decoded_json, indent = 4)

With open("json_ios_xe_compact.json", "w") as json_file:
json_file__________________(dencoded_json_compact)

with open("json_ios_xe_indented.json", "w") as json_file:
json_file.write(encoded_json_indented)

A. dumps
B. loads
C. open
D. read
E. load
F. write

Answer: DBAF

Explanation
1. read
2. loads
3. dumps
4. write
Although we can use “load” method (for the first blank box) to read a file object and parse it at the same time but it requires a parameter so we cannot use it at the first blank box (at 3rd line). For example, we can use “load” with this:

with open("json_ios_xe.json", "r") as json_file:
    json_file_content = json_file.load(json_file)
Therefore in this question we must use “read” instead at the first blank box then parse it later at the second blank box with “loads”.

Good reference: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/loading-a-json-file-in-python-how-to-read-and-parse-json/

json.dumps() takes a JSON object and returns a string.

D. R4(config)# router bgp 65020
R4(config-router)# bgp default local-preference 200

R5(config)# router bgp 65020
R5(config-router)# bgp default local-preference 300

Answer: B

Explanation
We can use local preference attribute to influence the decision of iBGP neighbor to choose the path to external BGP neighbors:

In this question we need to configure higher local preference value on R2 than on R1.

Question 88
Drag and drop the code snippets from the bottom onto the blanks in the Python script to convert a Python object into a JSON string. Not all options are used.

import ____________

data = {
...
}

model = data["devices"][0]["model"]

json_string = ________________(data)

print(______________)

A. json.dumps
B. json
C. json_string
D. json.loads

Answer: BAC

Explanation
1. json
2. json.dumps
3. json_string

The json.dumps() function is used to convert Python objects (dictionary, list, string, integer, boolean… type) into JSON strings. Here’s a simple example:

import json
data = {'name': 'John', 'age': 25} #Define a Python dictionary
json_data = json.dumps(data) #Use json.dumps() to convert the dictionary into a JSON string
print(json_data) #Output: '{"name": "John", "age": 25}'

An engines configured TACACS+ to authenticate remote users but the configuration is not working as expected. Which configuration must be applied to enable access?
A. R1(config)#ip tacacs source-interface Gig0/0
B. R1(config)#tacacs-server prod
R1(config-server-tacacs)#key cisco123
C. R1(config)#aaa authorization exec default group tacacs+ local
D. R1(config)#tacacs-server prod
R1(config-server-tacacs)#port 1020

Answer: B

Explanation
From the output, we see the last line is “Invalid AUTHEN packet (check keys)” so surely the key was not matched.

Question 98
Which access control feature does MAB provide?
A. user access based on IP address
B. allows devices to bypass authenticate
C. network access based on the physical address of a device
D. simultaneous user and device authentication

Answer: C

Explanation
Standalone MAC Authentication Bypass (MAB) is an authentication method that grants network access to specific MAC addresses regardless of 802.1X capability or credentials. As a result, devices such as cash registers, fax machines, and printers can be readily authenticated, and network features that are based on authorization policies can be made available.

Question 99
What function does VXLAN perform in an SD-Access deployment?
A. policy plane forwarding
B. control plane forwarding
C. data plane forwarding
D. systems management and orchestration

Answer: C

Explanation 


Question 2
What is a characteristic of traffic shaping?
A. drops out-of-profile packets
B. can be applied in both traffic directions
C. queues out-of-profile packets until the buffer is full
D. causes TCP retransmits when packets are dropped

Answer: C

Explanation
Traffic shaping can be applied to outgoing direction only. Traffic shaping queues excess traffic by holding packets inside a shaping queue (buffer) -> Answer C is correct.

Note: The portion of the traffic that causes the flow to exceed its QoS limit is referred to as out‑of‑profile packets.

Question 3
Why would an architect use an OSPF virtual link?
A. to merge two existing Area 0s through a nonbackbone
B. to allow a stub area to transit another stub area
C. to connect a nonbackbone area to Area 0 through another nonbackbone area
D. to connect two networks that have overlapping private IP address space

Answer: C

Explanation
In fact there are two correct answers here:

All areas in an Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) autonomous system must be physically connected to the backbone area (Area 0). In some cases, where this is not possible, you can use a virtual link to connect to the backbone through a non-backbone area (-> Answer C is correct). You can also use virtual links to connect two parts of a partitioned backbone through a non-backbone area (-> Answer A is correct).

Reference: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/open-shortest-path-first-ospf/47866-ospfdb7.html

But if we have to choose one then answer C is better as it is used more popularly than answer A.

Question 13
Drag and drop the code snippets from the bottom onto the blanks in the script to convert a Python object into a JSON string. Not all options are used.

Import json

Data = {
...
}

Obj = json._____________()._______________(_____________)

A. data
B. JSONEncoder
C. encode
D. decode
E. JSONDecoder

Answer: BCA

Explanation
1. JSONEncoder
2. encode
3. data
JSONEncoder class is used for serialization of any Python object while performing encoding. It contains three different methods of encoding which are:
+ default(obj) – Implemented in the subclass and return serialize object for o object.
+ encode(obj) – Same as JSON dumps Python method return JSON string of Python data structure.
+ iterencode(obj) – Represent string one by one and encode object.


Question 15
Refer to the exhibit.

SW1
monitor session 1 type rpsan-dest
source remote vlan 50
dest int gig0/1

SW2
monitor session 1 type rpsan-source
source vlan 60
dest remote vlan 50

An engineer must send the 172.16.2.0/24 user traffic to a packet capture tool to troubleshoot an issue. Which action completes the configuration?
A. Disable the spanning tree protocol on the monitoring server VLAN.
B. Enable the Cisco Discovery Protocol on the server interfaces.
C. Encrypt the traffic between the users and the monitoring servers.
D. Define the remote span VLAN on SW1 and SW2.

Answer: D

Explanation
We need to define the remote span VLAN on both switches as well:

SW1(config)#vlan 50
SW1(config-vlan)#remote-span

SW2(config)#vlan 50
SW2(config-vlan)#remote-span
Note: In this question, SW2 captures all VLAN 60 traffic and send them to SW1 via VLAN 50.

Question 16
What is one characteristic of Cisco DNA Center and vManage northbound APIs?
A. They push configuration changes down to devices.
B. They implement the RESTCONF protocol.
C. They exchange XML-formatted content.
D. They implement the NETCONF protocol.

Answer: C

Explanation
Answer A answer B and answer D are not correct as they are characteristics of southbound APIs, not northbound.

Answer C is the best choice as both DNA Center and vManage use REST APIs, which can use XML or JSON as data formats for exchanging information between the client and the server.

Question 17
High bandwidth utilization is occurring on interface Gig0/1 of a router. An engineer must identify the flows that are consuming the most bandwidth. Cisco DNA Center is used as a flow exporter and is configured with the IP address 192.168.23.1 and UDP port 23000. Which configuration must be applied to set NetFlow data export and capture on the router?

Option A
R1(config)# ip flow-export
R1(config)# ip flow-export destination 192.168.23.1 23000
R1(config)# interface Gig0/1
R1(config-if)# ip flow monitor

Option B
R1(config)# ip flow-export
R1(config)# ip flow-export destination 192.168.23.1
R1 (config)# interface Gig0/1
R1(config-if)# collect counter bytes
R1(config-if)# collect counter packets

Option C
R1(config)# ip flow-export version 9
R1(config)# ip flow-export destination 192.168.23.1 23000
R1(config)# interface Gig0/1
R1(config-if)# ip flow ingress
R1(config-if)# ip flow egress

Option D
R1(config)# ip flow-export version 9
R1(config)# ip flow-export destination 192.168.23.1 23000
R1(config)# interface Gig0/1
R1(config-if)# ip flow-top-talkers

A. Option A
B. Option B
C. Option C
D. Option D

Answer: C

Explanation
The default UDP port is 2055 but we need port 23000 in this question so we have to manually configure it with “ip flow-export destination 192.168.23.1 23000” command. Also the “collect counter bytes” & “collect counter packets” must be placed under flow record, not under interface mode -> Option B is not correct.

The syntax of “ip flow monitor …” command is ip flow monitor {monitor_name} -> Option A is not correct.

The “top talkers” feature must be configured under global configuration mode, not interface mode -> Option D is not correct.

-> Only Option C is left.

Question 18

A network engineer must use a Python script to convert data received from a network device. Which type of data is printed to the console when the script runs?
A. dictionary with a key-value pair
B. list of strings
C. tuple list
D. list of lists

Answer: A

Explanation
We created initial variables to test this script and print the type of the result:

The type of the result is “dictionary”.

Code explanation:

line.split("=>"): This part splits the input string line into a list of substrings using the “=>” delimiter. For example, if line is “vlan1 => 10”, line.split("=>") would produce ['vlan1 ', ' 10'].

[word.strip() for word in line.split("=>")]: This is a list comprehension that iterates over each element in the list obtained from the previous step (line.split("=>")). For each element word, the strip() method is applied to remove leading and trailing whitespace. This results in a new list of cleaned-up strings.

k, v = [word.strip() for word in line.split("=>")]: This unpacks the two elements of the list into the variables k and v. In the example of “vlan1 => 10”, after this line of code, k would be assigned the value “vlan1” (with leading and trailing spaces removed), and v would be assigned the value “10” (with leading and trailing spaces removed).

In summary, this line of code is used to extract key-value pairs from a string by splitting it based on the “=>” delimiter and removing any extra whitespace around the keys and values.

Question 23
An engineer creates the configuration below. Drag and drop the authentication methods from the left into the order of priority on the right. Not all options are used.

R1#sh run | i aaa
aaa new-model
aaa authentication login default group ACE group AAA_RADIUS local-case
aaa session-id common
R1#

Put each login method in the correct order. Use all four.
A. AAA_RADIUS group
B. Deny
C. ACE group
D. local

Answer: CADB

Explanation
The “aaa authentication login default group ACE group AAA_RADIUS local-case” command is broken down as follows:

+ The ‘aaa authentication’ part is simply saying we want to configure authentication settings.
+ The ‘login’ is stating that we want to prompt for a username/password when a connection is made to the device.
+ The ‘default’ means we want to apply for all login connections (such as tty, vty, console and aux). If we use this keyword, we don’t need to configure anything else under tty, vty and aux lines. If we don’t use this keyword then we have to specify which line(s) we want to apply the authentication feature.
+ The ‘group ACE group AAA_RADIUS” means all users are authenticated using group ACE (the first method). If the credentials are not found on this group, then the group AAA_RADIUS is used (the second method).
+ The ‘local-case‘ option uses case-sensitive local usernames.

Question 26
An engineer must save the configuration of router R2 using the NETCONF protocol. Which script must be used?

Option A
<?xml version=1 encoding= utf-8?>

Question 29
What is the result of this python program (3*5)%2?
A. 7
B. 7.5
C. 0
D. 1

Answer: D

Explanation
This question is missing a number after “%”. From the answers, we believe the number after “%” is 2 so the full question is (3*5)%2 so the result is 1.

Note: The % symbol in Python is called the Modulo Operator. It returns the remainder of dividing the left hand operand by right hand operand. It’s used to get the remainder of a division problem.

Question 30
How are control traffic, client authentication and data traffic handled in a mobility express environment?
A. Control traffic and client authentication is handled centrally by the controller. Data traffic is switched centrally by the controller.
B. Control traffic and client authentication is handled centrally by the controller. Data traffic is switched locally by the access points.
C. Control traffic and client authentication is handled locally by each access point. Data traffic is switched locally by the access points.
D. Control traffic and client authentication is handled locally by each access point. Data traffic is switched centrally by the controller.

Answer: B

Explanation

Question 31
Which Cisco DNA Center Assurance feature verifies host reachability?
A. detail information
B. application experience
C. path trace
D. network time travel

Answer: C

Explanation
When you initiate a path trace, the Cisco DNA Center controller reviews and collects network topology and routing data from the discovered devices. It then uses this data to calculate a path between the two hosts or Layer 3 interfaces, and displays the path in a path trace topology. The topology includes the path direction and the devices along the path, including their IP addresses.

A. Set the EtherChannel to mode active.
B. Set the EtherChannel to mode on.
C. Configure the EtherChannel members in desirable mode.
D. Configure the EtherChannel members in passive mode.

An engineer must prevent VLAN 20 routes from appearing in the routing table of Switch-1. Which command set must be applied?

Option A
On Switch-2:
router ospf 1
distribute-list 1 in
access-list 1 deny 192.168.2.0 0.0.0.255

Option B
On Switch-2:
router ospf 1
distribute-list 1 out
access-list 1 permit 192.168.2.0 0.0.0.255

Option C
On Switch-1:
router ospf 1
distribute-list 1 out
access-list 1 deny 192.168.2.0 0.0.0.255

Option D
On Switch-1:
router ospf 1
distribute-list 1 in
access-list 1 deny 192.168.2.0 0.0.0.255

A. Option A
B. Option B
C. Option C
D. Option D

Answer: D

Explanation
There are two ways to prevent VLAN 20 routes from appearing in the routing table of Switch-1 with distribute-list:
+ Deny this route on Switch-1 inbound direction so Switch-1 will not learn about this route
+ Deny this route on Switch-2 outbound direction so Switch-2 will not advertise this route

-> We must use an access-list with a “deny” statement for 192.168.2.0/24 -> Only Option D is correct.

But there is a mistake in this question as we must allow other prefixes (routes) to be learned with the “access-list 1 permit any” statement under above “deny” statement. Otherwise all other prefixes will be dropped as well.

Question 36

Router(config)#clock timezone EST -5 0
Router(config)#clock summer-time EDT recurring
Router(config)#clock calendar-valid
Router(config)#ntp master
Router(config)#interface vlan 3
Router(config-if)#ntp broadcast

What are two results of the NTP configuration? (Choose two)
A. It distributes the time via NTP broadcast packets.
B. It distributes the time via NTP broadcast and multicast packets.
C. It uses other systems as an authoritative time source.
D. It uses the hardware clock as an authoritative time source.
E. It forms a peer association with another system.

Answer: AD

Explanation
The command “clock timezone EST -5 0” is used to set the time zone on a Cisco device. “EST” is the abbreviation for the “Eastern Standard Time” zone. “-5” value represents the time zone offset from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). In this example, it is set to -5 hours. If your time zone is ahead of UTC, you would use a positive value; if it’s behind, you use a negative value. The last parameter (0 in this case) represents whether or not daylight saving time (DST) is in effect. A value of 0 means that DST is not observed.

The command “clock summer-time EDT recurring” is used to configure daylight saving time (DST) on a Cisco device.

The command “clock calendar-valid” enables the router to act as a valid time source to which network peers can synchronize. By default, the time maintained on the software clock is not considered to be reliable and will not be synchronized with NTP or VINES time service -> Answer D is correct.

The command “ntp broadcast” enables the interface to send NTP broadcast packets to a peer. If we want to use multicast for NTP synchronization, we must use the “ntp multicast” command instead -> Answer C is correct while answer B is not correct.

With all of the above commands, the local router becomes an authoritative NTP server and broadcast NTP messages to NTP clients.

Question 38
Refer to the exhibit.

event manager applet Config
event cli pattern "config term" ___________
action 1.0 cli command "enable"

An engineer constructs an EEM applet to prevent anyone from entering configuration mode on a switch. Which snippet is required to complete the EEM applet?
A. sync yes skip yes
B. sync no skip yes
C. sync no skip no
D. sync yes skip no 

Answer: B

Explanation
When you use the “sync yes” option in the event cli command, the EEM applet runs before the CLI command is executed. The EEM applet should set the _exit_status variable to indicate whether the CLI command should be executed (_exit_status set to one) or not (_exit_status set to zero). But in this question we don’t use the _exit_status variable so we have to use the “syn no” option -> Only answer B and answer C are correct.

With the “sync no” option, the EEM applet is executed in background in parallel with the CLI command. As the CLI command starts at the same time as the EEM applet, you cannot use the _exit_status variable anymore; you have to specify whether you want the CLI command to execute with the skip yes|no option of the event cli command. In this question, we want to ignore the “configure terminal” command so we have to set the “skip yes” option -> Only answer B is correct.

Question 39
What is a characteristic of vManage?
A. It leverages the overlay management protocol to interface with WAN Edge devices.
B. It uses NETCONF to configure vSmart devices to build the overlay network data plane.
C. It requires a public IP address to allow WAN Edge devices to discover fabric components.
D. It supports protocols such as OSPF to integrate with legacy network devices.

Answer: B

Explanation
Centralized policies are built using vManage, and then stored in its database. They are then sent via NETCONF to the vSmart controller to become a part of vSmart configurations.-> Answer B is correct.

The vSmart controller then uses Overlay Management Protocol (OMP) to send the policy parameters as updates in the routing protocol to all of the WAN edge devices -> Answer A is not correct.

network 172.27.206.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
network 172.24.206.0 0.0.0.255 area 0

Answer: D

Explanation
By using the correct and exact network and subnet masks, CR1 will not turn on OSPF on new interfaces and it cannot exchange OSPF with other network devices by other interfaces than Gi0/0 & Gi0/1.

In this question we should understand that these commands make sure CR1 cannot form OSPF neighbor relationship with other routers directly (on a new interface). If it is connected through a switch then surely it can form OSPF neighbor relationship. For example if we add a new router to SW3 in the 10.165.231.0/24 subnet then surely it will create OSPF neighbor relationshipo with CR1.

Answer “router ospf 1
network 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255 area 0
passive-interface GigabitEthernet0/2″

is not correct because if CR1 has a new interface then OSPF will also be turned on that interface.
Answer “interface Gi0/2
ip ospf 1 area 0
!
router ospf 1
passive-interface GigabitEthernet0/2″

is not correct as OSPF is not run on Gi0/1 and CR1 and CR3 cannot exchange OSPF information.

Question 44
Which configuration saves the running configuration to the startup configuration and logs a “saving configuration automatically” message when a syslog message that contains “SYS-5-CONFIG_I” is received’?

Option A
event manager applet saveconfig 
 event syslog pattern "SYS-5-CONFIG_I" period 1 
 event track 1 
 action 1.0 cli command "write mem" 
 action 2.0 syslog msg "saving configuration automatically"

Option B
event manager applet save_config
 action 1.0 string match "SYS-5-CONFIG_I" save_config
 action 2.0 cli command "write mem"
 action 3.0 syslog msg "saving configuration automatically"

Option C
event manager applet save_config
 event syslog pattern "SYS-5-CONFIG_I" period 1
 action 1.0 cli command "end"
 action 2.0 cli command "write mem
 action 3.0 syslog msg "saving configuration automatically"

Option D
event manager applet save_config
 event syslog pattern "SYS-5-CONFIG_I" period 1
 action 1.0 cli command "write mem"
 action 2.0 syslog msg "saving configuration automatically"

A. Option A
B. Option B
C. Option C
D. Option D 

Answer: D

Explanation
To use the “string match” keyword, we should use “?” and “*” to match the whole string or it will return false. For example we should use: action 1.0 string match “*SYS-5-CONFIG_I*” save_config

When we receive the pattern “SYS-5-CONFIG_I”, that means we have just configured something and exited configuration mode. In the example below, we will see the syslog “%SYS-5-CONFIG_I” message after exit the configuration mode:

-> Therefore we don’t need the “end” command -> Option D is correct.

Question 45
Which type of antenna is designed to provide a 360-degree radiation pattern?

Question 46
Refer to the exhibit.

Channel Assignment - Auto
Avoid Foreign AP interference - Enabled
Avoid Cisco AP load - Disabled
Avoid non-802.11a noise - Enabled
Avoid Persistent Non-Wifi Interference - Disabled
DCA Channel Sensitivity - Medium
Channel Width - 40 MHz
EDRRM - Disabled

An engineer is troubleshooting an issue with non-Wi-Fi interference on the 5-GHz band. The engineer has enabled Cisco CleanAir and set the appropriate traps, but the AP does not change the channel when it detects significant interference. Which action will resolve the issue?
A. Enable the Event Driven Radio Resource Management option
B. Change the DCA Sensitivity option to High
C. Enable the Avoid Persistent Non-WiFi interference option
D. Disable the Avoid Foreign AP Interference option

Answer: A

Explanation
DRRM is a feature that allows an access point that is in distress to bypass normal RRM intervals and immediately change channels. A CleanAir access point always monitors AQ and reports the AQ every 15 minutes. AQ only reports classified interference devices. The key benefit of EDRRM is fast action time.

A is correct

C works differently.
if the Persistent Device Avoidance function is enabled, the interference will be marked so that the access-points that have been affected by the interference do not use the channel again.

Reference: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/wireless/controller/9800/16-12/config-guide/b_wl_16_12_cg/cisco-cleanair.html

hostname router 
ip domain-name cisco.com

line vty 0 15 
session-timeout 30 
exec-timeout 120 0 
login local

Which configuration must be added to enable remote access only using SSHv1 or SSHv2 to this router?

Option A
R1(config)# crypto key generate rsa modulus 2048
R1(config)# line vty 0 15
R1(config-line)# transport input ssh

Option B
R1(config)# ip ssh version 2
R1(config)# line vty 0 15
R1(config-line)# transport input ssh
R1(config-line)# transport output ssh

Option C
R1(config)# crypto key generate rsa modulus 2048
R1(config)# ip ssh version 2
R1(config)# line vty 0 15
R1(config-line)# transport input all

Option D
R1(config)# line vty 0 15
R1(config-line)# transport input ssh
R1(config-line)# transport output ssh

A. Option A
B. Option B
C. Option C
D. Option D

Answer: A

Explanation
To enable remote access via SSH, we only need the “transport input ssh” (not “transport output ssh”).

The command “crypto key generate rsa modulus 2048” is required to generate the RSA key with key-size of 2048 bits.

The “login local” command means that authentication uses locally configured credentials using the “username … password/secret …” command. Therefore in fact we need to configure an username and password on this device as well.

Steps to configure SSH:
1. Configure the router hostname using command “hostname”.
2. Configure the domain name using command “ip domain-name”.
3. Generate public and private keys using command “crypto key generate rsa”.
4. Create a user in the local database using command “username…secret”.
5. Allow only SSH access on VTY lines using command “transport input ssh”.

Question 51
Which two actions are recommended as security best practices to protect REST API? (Choose two)
A. Enable out-of-band authentication
B. Use a password hash
C. Use TACACS+ authentication
D. Use SSL for encryption
E. Enable dual authentication of the session

Answer: BD

Explanation
Passwords must always be hashed to protect the system (or minimize the damage) even if it is compromised in some hacking attempts. There are many such hashing algorithms that can prove really effective for password security e.g. PBKDF2, bcrypt, and scrypt algorithms. -> Answer B is correct.

By always using SSL, the authentication credentials can be simplified to a randomly generated access token. The token is delivered in the username field of HTTP Basic Auth. It’s relatively simple to use, and you get a lot of security features for free. -> Answer D is correct.

RESTful APIs should be stateless – so request authentication/authorization should not depend on sessions -> Answer E is not correct.

Question 52
How do the MAC address table and TCAM differ?
A. TCAM is populated from the ARP file, and the MAC address table is populated from the switch configuration file
B. TCAM stores Layer 2 forwarding information, and the MAC address table stores QoS information
C. TCAM is a type of memory and the MAC address table is a logical structure
D. TCAM lookups can match only 1s and 0s, and MAC address lookups can match 1s, 0s and a third “care/don’t care” state

Answer: C

Explanation
When using Ternary Content Addressable Memory (TCAM) inside routers it’s used for faster address lookup that enables fast routing.

MAC address table is contented in Content Addressable Memory (CAM), which is used for building and lookup of mac address table that enables L2 forwarding decisions.

Question 55
What does the Cisco WLC Layer 3 roaming feature allow clients to do?
A. maintain their IP address when roaming to an AP or controller with a different client VLAN assignment
B. maintain their connection between APs even when the AP management VLANs are different
C. maintain their connection even if the client IP address changes when roaming
D. roam seamlessly between controllers even when the controller management VLANs are different

Answer: A

Explanation
When a client starts an intercontroller roam, the two WLCs compare the VLAN IDs allocated to their WLAN interfaces. If the VLAN IDs are the same, then the client performs a Layer 2 intercontroller roam and keeps using its original IP address on the new AP and WLC. If the VLAN IDs are different, the WLCs will arrange a Layer 3 or local-to-foreign roam, allowing the client to continue using its current IP address.

Which hypervisor requires a host OS to run and is not allowed to directly access the hosts hardware and resources?
A. native
B. bare metal
C. type 1
D. type 2

Answer: D

Explanation
In contrast to type 1 hypervisor, a type 2 hypervisor (or hosted hypervisor) runs on top of an operating system and not the physical hardware directly. A big advantage of Type 2 hypervisors is that management console software is not required. Examples of type 2 hypervisor are VMware Workstation (which can run on Windows, Mac and Linux) or Microsoft Virtual PC (only runs on Windows).

Question 62
Refer to the exhibit.

Router# show running-config

radius-server key cisco123

A network engineer must permit administrators to automatically authenticate if there is no response from either of the AAA servers. Which configuration achieves these results?
A. aaa authentication login default group tacacs+ line
B. aaa authentication login default group radius
C. aaa authentication enable default group radius local
D. aaa authentication login default group radius none

Answer: D

Explanation
If “automatically authenticate” means no authentication is required then answer D is correct with keyword “none” (requires no authentication if “radius” servers fails).

If “automatically authenticate” means authentication with local database of the router then answer C is correct with keyword “local” (requires authentication with local username & password).

But maybe this question implied “no authentication is required” so answer D is better.

Question 63
What is a characteristic of Cisco DNA southbound APIs?
A. implements monitoring by using the SOAP protocol
B. enables orchestration and automation of network devices based on intent
C. utilizes REST API
D. simplifies management of network devices

Answer: D

Explanation
Only Northbound APIs uses REST API -> Answer C is not correct. Also Northbound APIs are also called “Intent APIs” -> Answer B is not correct.

SOAP is a Northbound API -> Answer A is not correct.

Answer D is the best choice as Southbound API is used to communicated with network devices.

Question 64
How is OAuth framework used in REST API?
A. by providing the external application a token that authorizes access to the account
B. by providing the user credentials to the external application
C. as a framework to hide the security information in the REST URL
D. as a framework to hash the security information in the REST URL 

Answer: A

Explanation
Auth0 generates access tokens for API authorization scenarios, in JSON web token (JWT) format. The permissions represented by the access token, in OAuth terms, are known as scopes. When an application authenticates with Auth0, it specifies the scopes it wants. If those scopes are authorized by the user, then the access token will represent these authorized scopes.

Reference: https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/protocols/oauth

Question 66

        "grade":"9",
        "ID":"7460059362",
        "type":"on-line"
      }]

A. Option A
B. Option B
C. Option C
D. Option D

Answer: A

Explanation
JSON script always starts with {, not [ so only Option A & Option B are correct. But in Option B the last key/value pair should not have the comma (“type”:”indoor”,) -> Option B is not correct.

-> Only Option A is correct.

Question 69
How is CAPWAP data traffic encapsulated when running an Over the Top WLAN in a Cisco SD-Access wireless environment?
A. LISP
B. VXLAN
C. GRE
D. IPsec

Answer: B

Explanation
In SD-Access Wireless, the control plane is centralized. This means that, as with Cisco Unified Wireless Network, a Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP) tunnel is maintained between APs and WLC. The main difference is that in SD-Access Wireless, the data plane is distributed using a Virtual Extensible LAN (VXLAN) directly from the fabric-enabled APs.

Question 75
What are two characteristics of a directional antenna? (Choose two)
A. commonly used to cover large areas
B. low gain
C. provides the most focused and narrow beam-width
D. receive signals equally from all directions
E. high gain

Answer: CE

Explanation
A directional antenna transmits or receives signals in a specific direction only. Unlike omnidirectional antennas, directional antennas have a more focused beam designed to concentrate more energy in a single direction. This makes them more powerful than omnidirectional antennas and better suited for long-distance transmission.

Directional antennas have a higher signal gain than omnidirectional ones, allowing them to transmit signals over longer distances. This makes them the ideal choice for applications that require a more focused and specific transmission range. For instance, directional antennas are often used for satellite communication, radio astronomy, and long-distance wireless networking.

What is output by this code?

A. -1 -2 -3 -4
B. 8 7 6 5
C. 4 5 6 7
D. -4 -5 -6 -7

Answer: B

Explanation
This Python code uses a while loop to print the value of the variable count while it is greater than 4. The line count -= 1 is equivalent to count = count - 1 which decrements the value of count by 1 in each iteration of the loop.

Question 77A
Drag and drop the characteristics from the left onto the corresponding switching architectures on the right.
Which are related to the RIB? (Choose three)

A. It is built directly from the routing table
B. It is known as an IP routing table
C. It is build from information obtained from dynamic routing protocols, connected, and static routes
D. Each routing protocol has its own information base

Answer: BCD

Explanation
Each routing protocol like OSPF, EIGRP has its own Routing information base (RIB) and they select their best candidates to try to install to global RIB so that it can then be selected for forwarding. In order to view the RIB table, use the command “show ip ospf database” for OSPF, “show ip eigrp topology” for EIGRP or “show ip bgp” for BGP. To view the Forwarding Information Base (FIB), use the “show ip cef” command. RIB is in Control plane while FIB is in Data plane.

The Forwarding Information Base (FIB) contains destination reachability information as well as next hop information. This information is then used by the router to make forwarding decisions. The FIB allows for very efficient and easy lookups. Below is an example of the FIB table:

The FIB maintains next-hop address information based on the information in the IP routing table (RIB). In other words, FIB is a mirror copy of RIB.

RIB is in Control plane (and it is not used for forwarding) while FIB is in Data plane (and it is used for forwarding).

Question 79
An engineer is implementing a new SSID on a Cisco Catalyst 9800 Series WLC that must be broadcast on 6 GHz radios. Users will be required to use EAP-TLS to authenticate. Which wireless Layer 2 security method is required?
A. WPA2 Enterprise
B. WPA2 Personal
C. WPA3 Enterprise
D. WPA3 Personal

Answer: C

Explanation
EAP-TLS (Extensible Authentication Protocol with Transport Layer Security) is a more secure and scalable method, especially suitable for enterprise environments. It involves the use of digital certificates for both the client and the authentication server, providing a strong mutual authentication mechanism.

For enterprise deployments with the requirement of EAP-TLS, you should opt for WPA3-Enterprise or WPA2-Enterprise, depending on the compatibility of your devices.

WPA2-Enterprise uses EAP-TLS for authentication. It provides a high level of security but is based on older security standards.

WPA3-Enterprise is the latest Wi-Fi security standard and introduces improvements over WPA2. It supports EAP-TLS and includes additional security enhancements.

-> Therefore using WPA3 Enterprise is the better solution.

Question 86A
Drag and drop the QoS mechanisms from the left onto their descriptions on the right.
Which describes QoS shaping?
A. bandwidth management technique which delays datagrams
B. tool to enforce rate-limiting on ingress/egress
C. portion of the 802.1Q header used to classify packets

Answer: A

Explanation
Class of Service (CoS) is a 3 bit field within an Ethernet frame header when we use 802.1q which supports virtual LANs on an Ethernet network. This field specifies a priority value which is between 0 and 63 inclusive which can be used in the Quality of Service (QoS) to differentiate traffic.

Traffic policing is also known as rate limiting as it propagates bursts. When the traffic rate reaches the configured maximum rate (or committed information rate), excess traffic is dropped (or remarked). The result is an output rate that appears as a saw-tooth with crests and troughs.

Traffic shaping retains excess packets in a queue and then schedules the excess for later transmission over increments of time -> It causes delay.

Question 87
Drag and drop the code snippets from the bottom onto the blanks in the Python script to print the device model to the screen and write JSON data to a file. Not all options are used.

import json

data = {
....
}
____________ (data["devices"][0]["model"]
with ____________ ("data.json", "___________") as file:
json._____________ (data, file, incident=4)

A. dumps
B. print
C. dump
D. open
E. r
F. w

Answer: BDFC

Explanation
1. print
2. open
3. w
4. dump


This Python code defines a dictionary called data and then display the value associated with the key model in the first dictionary of the devices list. This will output the string “Cisco Nexus 3550”.

The code then opens a file called “data.json” in write mode using a with statement. The "w" in the second argument of the open() function indicates that the file should be opened in write mode.

The json.dump() method is then used to write the contents of the data dictionary to the “data.json” file in JSON format. The first argument to json.dump() is the dictionary to be written, the second argument is the file object to write to, and the indent parameter is set to 4 to make the output more readable.

We also tested this code and this is the result (file data.json is also created):

Question 92
When should the MAC authentication bypass feature be used on a switch port?
A. when the attached host supports 802.1X and must authenticate itself based on its MAC address instead of user credentials
B. when the attached host supports limited 802.1X
C. when authentication should be bypassed for select hosts based on their MAC address
D. when authentication is required, but the attached host does not support 802.1X

Answer: D

Explanation
802.1x is a great way to protect your network by authenticating everything you connect to your switch ports, However, one disadvantage of 802.1X is that your end devices have to support it. If you can’t use 802.1X but still want to secure your switch ports somehow, you can use MAC Authentication Bypass (MAB).

When you enable MAB on a switchport, the switch drops all frames except for the first frame to learn the MAC address. Pretty much any frame can be used to learn the MAC address except for CDP, LLDP, STP, and DTP traffic. Once the switch has learned the MAC address, it contacts an authentication server (RADIUS) to check if it permits the MAC address.

Question 93
To which category does a REST API that has been developed for IP address management integration belong?
A. southbound
B. eastbound
C. northbound
D. westbound

Answer: D

Explanation
+ Westbound (Integration) APIs: provide the capability to publish the network data, events and notifications to the external systems and consume information in Cisco DNA Center from the connected systems. Through integration APIs, Cisco DNA Center platform can power end-to-end IT processes across the value chain by integrating various domains such as IT Service Management (ITSM), IP address management (IPAM), and reporting.

Question 94
Which template is used when multiple templates are grouped together to run in succession in Cisco DNA Center?
A. regular
B. composite
C. project
D. configuration

Answer: B

Explanation
Composite templates allow for the reuse of multiple regular templates, which will enable us to modularize our code for reuse, thereby using smaller chunks of configuration. Composite templates also allow us one place to make changes that affect a broader set of devices. Thus, if we upgrade one regular template applied to multiple composite templates, we may effect change on a broader set of devices. This also allows us to reduce the duplication of efforts and minimize the administrator’s amount of effort.

Question 95
An engineer applies this configuration to router R1.

username cisco privilege 15 noescape secret 5 F7u$9cyE438490035m8TQ$nv&6502x
username cisco autocommand show startup-config
aaa authentication login default local-case enable
aaa authorization exec default local

How does R1 respond when the user ‘cisco’ logs in?
A. It places the user into EXEC mode and permits the user to execute any command
B. It displays the startup config and then permits the user to execute commands
C. It places the user into EXEC mode but permits the user to execute only the show startup-config command
D. It displays the startup config and then terminates the session

Answer: D

Explanation
The line “username cisco autocommand show startup-config” causes the specified command (“show startup-config” in this case) to be issued automatically after the user logs in. After the “autocommand” is executed, the user is logged out and the session is disconnected, unless you configure the “username user nohangup” option, which causes the session to remain active, giving the operator another login prompt.

The “noescape” keyword prevents a user from using an escape character on the host to which that user is connected.

Question 97
Which tag defines the roaming domain and properties of an AP deployment?
A. RF tag
B. policy tag
C. AP tag
D. site tag

Answer: D

Explanation
If custom/named site-tags are used, then all APs in the same named-site tags are assigned to the same WNCd. Consider site tag = roaming domain.

Reference: https://www.ciscolive.com/c/dam/r/ciscolive/global-event/docs/2023/pdf/BRKEWN-2338.pdf

Note:
Site Tag: Assigns the AP Join profile settings to the AP. The site tag defines the properties of a site, both central and remote (FlexConnect) site. The attributes of a site that are common across central and remote site are part of the AP Join profile.

The DevOps team noticed missing NetFlow data during peak utilization times for remote branches. Which configuration allows for this issue to be minimized or resolved?
A. Configure NetFlow on the in and outbound directions.
B. Configure long byte counters when specifying a flow record.
C. Change the transport type from UDP to TCP.
D. Change the flow monitor to IPv6 from IPv4.

Answer: B

Explanation
The “long” keyword enables collecting the total number of bytes or packets from the flow using a 64-bit counter rather than a 32-bit counter.

Reference: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios/fnetflow/command/reference/fnf_book/fnf_01.html#wp1305223

During peak utilization times, 32-bit counter may not be enough -> Answer B is the best choice.

Other answers are not correct as this issue is only observed in peak times.

Question 99
What is one being of implementing a data modeling language?
A. accuracy of the operations performed
B. uses XML style of data formatting
C. machine-oriented logic and language-facilitated processing.
D. conceptual representation to simplify interpretation.

Answer: D

Explanation
Data models are conceptual representations of data, defining the specific information that needs to be included and the format to represent it.

Reference: https://blogs.cisco.com/developer/coding-essentials

Question 100
What is the function of an RP in a PIM-SM network?
A. to connect multicast sources with receivers
B. to track sources and receivers on the shared distribution tree
C. to automate the distribution of group-to rendezvous point mappings
D. to provide routing to the PIM leaf routers

Answer: A

Explanation
The concept of joining the rendezvous point (RP) is called the RPT (Root Path Tree) or shared distribution tree. The RP is the root of our tree which decides where to forward multicast traffic to. Each multicast group might have different sources and receivers so we might have different RPTs in our network.

An RP acts as the meeting place for sources and receivers of multicast data. In a PIM-SM network, sources must send their traffic to the RP. This traffic is then forwarded to receivers down a shared distribution tree

Reference: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/ipmulti_pim/configuration/xe-3s/imc-pim-xe-3s-book/imc_pim_allowrp.pdf

Answer B is not correct as a RP is the meeting point of sources and receivers only. It does not “track” sources and receivers.

Answer C is not correct as it is a function of Auto-RP: Auto-RP uses IP multicast to automate the distribution of group-to-RP mappings to all Cisco routers and multilayer switches in a PIM network.

Reference: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/metro/me3600x_3800x/software/release/12-2_52_ey/configuration/guide/swmcast.html

Answer D is surely not correct as RP does not “provide routing”.

Question 1
How do OSPF and EIGRP compare?
A. EIGRP shows all known routes, and OSPF shows successor and feasible successor routes.
B. Both OSPF and EIGRP use the concept of areas.
C. OSPF and EIGRP use the same administrative distance.
D. EIGRP shows successor and feasible successor routes, and OSPF shows all known routes.

Answer: D

Explanation
This question mentions about the EIGRP topology table (with command “show ip eigrp topology”), which keeps all the Successor and Feasible Successor routes. OSPF topology table (with command “show ip ospf database”) contains the entire road map of the network with all available OSPF routers.

Question 2
By default, which virtual MAC address does HSRP group 41 use?
A. 0c:5e:ac:07:0c:29
B. 00:05:0c:07:ac:41
C. 004:41:73:18:84:29
D. 00:00:0c:07:ac:29

Answer: D

Explanation
HSRP version 1 uses the MAC address range 0000.0C07.ACxx while HSRP version 2 uses the MAC address range 0000.0C9F.Fxxx.

The last two-digit hex value in the MAC address presents the HSRP group number. In this case 29 in decimal is 10 in hexadecimal. -> Answer D is correct.

Question 3
What is a characteristic of Layer 3 roaming?
A. Clients must obtain a new IP address when they roam between APs
B. It is only supported on controllers that run SSO.
C. It provides seamless client roaming between APs in different Layer 3 networks but within the same mobility group
D. It provides seamless roaming between APs that are connected to different Layer 3 networks and different mobility groups.

Answer: D

Explanation
Layer 3 roaming in wireless networks typically takes place between different mobility groups (but in the same mobility doamin). A mobility group refers to a set of WLCs that share information to facilitate client roaming.

When a client device roams between access points controlled by different WLCs within the same mobility group, it’s usually referred to as layer 2 roaming. In this scenario, the client maintains its IP address and session as it moves between access points, and the WLCs coordinate handoffs seamlessly.

However, when a client roams between access points controlled by WLCs in different mobility groups, it’s considered layer 3 roaming. In this case, the client may need to obtain a new IP address and establish a new session as it moves between different subnets or networks managed by different WLCs.

Question 4
Which element is unique to a Type 2 hypervisor?
A. memory
B. VM OS
C. host OS
D. host hardware

Answer: C

Explanation
“host OS” means “Underlying operating system”. In contrast to type 1 hypervisor, a type 2 hypervisor (or hosted hypervisor) runs on top of an operating system (and this is called host OS) and not the physical hardware directly.

Question 5
Refer to the exhibit.

Switch(config)# ip sla schedule 5 start-time now life forever
Switch(config)# end

What is the result of the IP SLA configuration?
A. The operation runs 300 times a day
B. The operation runs 5000 times a day
C. The rate is configured to repeat every 5 minutes
D. IP SLA is scheduled to run at 3 a.m

Answer: C

Explanation
“frequency 300” means it runs every 300 seconds (5 minutes).

Question 6
Which method requires a client to authenticate and has the capability to function without encryption?
A. open
B. WEP
C. WebAuth
D. PSK

Answer: C

Explanation
WebAuth is an authentication method without encryption.

Reference: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/wireless-mobility/wlan-security/115951-web-auth-wlc-guide-00.html

Note: WebAuth (Web Authentication) is an authentication method generally used as fallback authentication method. This authentication method needs a interactive user to enter the username and password to the web browser.

Question 7
Refer to the exhibit.

Layer 2 Security mode - None, WPA + WPA2, WPA2 + WPA3, Static WEP
Authorization list - Default

A client requests a new SSID that will use web-based authentication and external RADIUS servers. Which Layer 2 security mode must be selected?
A. WPA + WPA2
B. WPA2 + WPA3
C. Static WEP
D. None

Answer: D

Explanation
This document explains how to perform external web authentication using an external RADIUS Server.
…
Configure the WLAN on WLC for Web Authentication
The next step is to configure the WLAN for web authentication on WLC. Perform these steps in order to configure the WLAN on WLC:
1. Click the WLANs menu from the controller GUI, and choose New.
2. Choose WLAN for Type.
3. Enter a Profile Name and a WLAN SSID of your choice, and click Apply.
4. Under the General tab, make sure that the Enabled option is checked for both Status and Broadcast SSID.
5. Choose an interface for the WLAN. Typically, an interface configured in a unique VLAN is mapped to the WLAN so that the client receives an IP address in that VLAN. In this example, we use management for Interface.
6. Choose the Security tab.
7. Under the Layer 2 menu, choose None for Layer 2 Security.
8. Under the Layer 3 menu, choose None for Layer 3 Security. Check the Web Policy checkbox, and choose Authentication.

Question 8
Refer to the exhibit.

event manager applet CONFIG_BACKUP
action 1.0 cli command "enable"
action 3.0 cli command "end"
action 4.0 cli command "exit"

write_backup.tcl
set output [exec "copy run backup"]
set fd [open "flash:/backup.txt" "w"]
puts $fd $output
close $fd

ios_config "file prompt quiet" "end"
copy flash:/backup.txt tftp://10.1.1.23/backup.txt
ios_config "no file prompt quiet" "end"
file delete -force "flash:/backup.txt"

Which statement is needed to complete the EEM applet and use the Tcl script to store the backup file?
A. action 2.0 cli command “write_backup.tcl tcl”
B. action 2.0 cli command “flash:write_backup.tcl”
C. action 2.0 cli command “write_backup.tcl”
D. action 2.0 cli command “tclsh flash:write_backup.tcl”

Answer: D

Explanation
In order to run the “write_backup.tcl” file with Tcl script we need to use start the EEM applet with “tclsh …” command. Also notice that “action 2.0” will be put under “action 1.0” and above “action 3.0” so this Tcl script will be run after “enable” and before “end” command.

For your information, this Tcl script will do the following things:

+ ios_config “file prompt quiet” “end”: This command configures the device to suppress prompts for confirmation when performing file operations. It sets the device to not prompt the user when it is saving or copying files.

+ copy flash:/backup.txt tftp://10.1.1.23/backup.txt: This command copies a file named “backup.txt” from the device’s flash memory to a TFTP server located at the IP address 10.1.1.23. This is likely used for backing up configurations or other important files.

+ ios_config “no file prompt quiet” “end”: This command restores the default behavior of the device, enabling prompts for confirmation during file operations.

+ file delete -force “flash:/backup.txt”: This command deletes the “backup.txt” file from the device’s flash memory. The -force flag is used to bypass any confirmation prompts and delete the file immediately.

Question 9
What is a characteristics of Wi-Fi channels?
A. The 2.4-GHz band 2 non-overlapping channels
B. Devices that connect to the same Wi-Fi channel reside in the same collision domain.
C. Wi-Fi channels are spaced 30 MHz apart.
D. The 5-GHz band offers 11 different channels for Wi-Fi clients

Answer: B

Explanation
WiFi channels are smaller bands within WiFi frequency bands that are used by your wireless network to send and receive data. Depending on which frequency band your router is using, you have a certain number of WiFi channels to choose from:
+ 11 WiFi channels are in the 2.4 GHz frequency band (3 non-overlapping channels) -> Answer A is not correct.
+ 45 WiFi channels are in the 5 GHz frequency band (24 non-overlapping channels) -> Answer D is not correct.

Due to the WiFi standard, the channel spacing is 5 MHz. This causes that when the band is placed in a particular channel, for example, 6, there are 15MHz overlapping adjacent channels (part of 4, 5, 7, and 8) -> Answer C is not correct.

Question 10

An administrator must enable RESTCONF access to a router. Which two commands or command sets must be added to the existing configuration? (Choose two)

A. aaa authentication login default local
aaa authorization exec default local
B. restconf
C. username restconf privilege 0
D. netconf-yang

Answer: AB

Explanation
The CLI command to enable RESTCONF is displayed below:
restconf
Once enabled via CLI, all supported operations may be governed through model interfaces, including optional settings for RESTCONF configuration and operational data settings.

Reference: https://developer.cisco.com/docs/ios-xe/#!enabling-restconf-on-ios-xe/httphttps

Also we enable AAA so we need to configure suitable AAA commands for it.

Question 11
Which port is required to allow APs to join a WLC when directed broadcasts are used on a Cisco IOS switch?
A. UDP 5246
B. TCP 5246
C. TCP 5247
D. UDP 5247

Answer: A

Explanation
After the LAP gets an IP address from the DHCP server, the LAP broadcasts a Layer 3 CAPWAP discovery message on to its local subnet Normally these broadcast are limited to local subnet as it will not cross layer 3 boundaries.

Since CAPWAP broadcast uses UDP port 5246 it must be explicitly forwarded on the router. You have to use “ip forward-protocol udp <port-no>” CLI command for this.

Reference: https://mrncciew.com/2013/05/04/wlc-discovery-via-broadcast/

Question 12
Which security feature does stateless authentication and authorization use for REST API calls?
A. SSL/TLS certificate encryption
B. API keys
C. OAuth 2 token
D. Cookie-based session authentication

Answer: C

Explanation
Statelessness means that every HTTP request happens in complete isolation. When the client makes an HTTP request, it includes all information necessary for the server to fulfill the request.

The server never relies on information from previous requests from the client. If any such information is important then the client will send that as part of the current request.

Reference: https://restfulapi.net/statelessness/

TLS/SSL is stateful. The web server and the client (browser) cache the session including the cryptographic keys to improve performance and do not perform key exchange for every request. -> Answer A is not correct.

Cookie/Session Based Authentications are stateful. Here is how it works: The server creates a session ID upon a user’s login request, storing it in either a database or an in-memory cache on the server. This session ID is then stored on a cookie in the user’s browser. With each subsequent request, the server receives the cookie containing the session ID and validates the user’s identity by comparing it with the corresponding session information stored on the server. -> Answer D is not correct.

Token-based authentication enables users to obtain a token that allows them to access a service and/or fetch a specific resource without using their username and password to authenticate every request. Because the token can be a self-contained entity that conveys all the required information for authenticating the request, it is often referred to as stateless authentication.

The authentication token is created by the authenticating service and contains information to identify a particular user and the token validity. The token itself is cryptographically signed to prevent tampering.

After the token is validated by the service, it is used to establish security context for the client, so the service can make authorization decisions or audit activity for successive user requests -> Answer C is correct.

Reference: https://doubleoctopus.com/security-wiki/network-architecture/stateless-authentication/

When you use an API key to authenticate to an API, the API key does not identify a principal, nor does it provide any authorization information. -> Answer B is not correct.

Question 13

B. RESTCONF is not enabled on the device.
C. There is no BGP process running on the device

Answer: A

Explanation
After running this code, we received the message “HTTP Response: 404 Not Found” so answer A is the best choice.

Question 14
An engineer must configure HSRP for VLAN 1200 on SW1. The second switch is configured by using the last usable IP address in the network as the virtual IP. Which command set accomplishes this task?

Option A
SW1(config)#interface vlan 1200
SW1(config-if)#ip address 172.12.0.2 255.255.255.0
SW1(config-if)#standby 1200 ip 172.12.0.254
SW1(config-if)#standby 1200 timers 5 15
SW1(config-if)#standby 1200 preempt

Option B
SW1(config)#interface vlan 1200
SW1(config-if)#ip address 172.12.0.2 255.255.255.0
SW1(config-if)#standby version 2
SW1(config-if)#standby 1200 ip 172.12.0.254
SW1(config-if)#standby 1200 preempt

Option C
SW1(config)#interface vlan 1200
SW1(config-if)#ip address 172.12.0.1 255.255.255.0
SW1(config-if)#standby 1200 ip 172.12.0.254
SW1(config-if)#standby 1200 timers 5 15
SW1(config-if)#standby 1200 preempt

Option D
SW1(config)#interface vlan 1200
SW1(config-if)#ip address 172.12.0.254 255.255.255.0
SW1(config-if)#standby version 2
SW1(config-if)#standby 1200 ip 172.12.0.2
SW1(config-if)#standby 1200 preempt

A. Option A
B. Option B
C. Option C
D. Option D

Answer: B

Explanation
The group numbers of HSRP version 1 range from 0 to 255. HSRP does support group number of 0 (we do check it and in fact, it is the default group number if you don’t enter group number in the configuration) so HSRP version 1 supports up to 256 group numbers. HSRP version 2 supports 4096 group numbers so in this question we must configure HSRP version 2.

The virtual IP address must be the same on two HSRP switches so we must have command “standby 1200 ip 172.12.0.254” on both switches.

Question 15

Question 16
When the ”deny” statement is used within a route map that is used for policy-based routing, how is the traffic that matches the deny route-map line treated?
A. An additional sequential route-map line is needed to policy route this traffic.
B. Traffic is routed to the null 0 interface of the router and discarded.
C. An additional sequential route-map line is needed to divert the traffic to the router’s normal forwarding behavior.
D. Traffic is returned to the normal forwarding behavior of the router.

Answer: D

Explanation
Within a route map used for PBR, you can reference ACLs to match specific types of traffic. The deny statements in these ACLs are effectively ignored in the context of PBR. This means that when a packet matches a ‘deny’ statement in an ACL referenced by a route map for PBR, it is not actively denied; rather, it is not matched by the PBR policy and thus is processed using the regular routing table, not the PBR-defined path.

A. TCAM entries are stored for 600 seconds, and MAC address table entries are kept for 200 seconds
B. TCAM entries are populated using the ARP table and the MAC address table is populated dynamically from outgoing frames
C. TCAM entries consist of VLAN port ID and source MAC Address, and MAC address table entries consist of source MAC address and port ID
D. TCAM entries are composed of value, mask, and result and MAC address table entries are composed of value and results

Answer: D

Explanation
Each TCAM entry consist of three components: Value, Mask and Result. -> Answer C is not correct.

Reference: https://learningnetwork.cisco.com/s/article/tcam-demystified

MAC address table entries are composted of value, which is an INDEX or key value (MAC) and looks up for a result value (port ID or VlanID) -> Answer D is correct.

The default aging time of MAC address entries is 5 minutes (300 seconds) -> Answer A is correct.

MAC address table is populated by incoming frames -> Answer B is not correct.

What is a difference between OSPF and EIGRP?
A. OSPF is an advanced distance vector protocol, EIGRP is a link-state protocol.
B. OSPF is a hybrid routing protocol, EIGRP is a link-state routing protocol
C. OSPF uses the DUAL algorithm, EIGRP uses the SPF algorithm
D. OSPF uses an administrative distance of 110, EIGRP uses an administrative distance of 170.

Answer: D

Explanation
OSPF is a link-state routing protocol while EIGRP is an advanced distance vector protocol -> Answer A and answer B are not correct.

EIGRP uses DUAL algorithm while OSPF uses SPF algorithm -> Answer C is not correct.

OSPF administrative distance is 110 and EIGRP External route administrative distance is 170 -> Answer D is correct although it is tricky.

C. mobility tunnel
D. GRE tunnel

Answer: C

Explanation
The controller supports seamless roaming across multiple mobility groups. During seamless roaming, the client maintains its IP address across all mobility groups. When a client crosses a mobility group boundary during a roam, the client is fully authenticated, but the IP address is maintained, and mobility tunneling is initiated for Layer 3 roaming.

Question 22
An engineer adds a new switch to a Cisco StackWise stack. The switch that was active before the switch was added is elected as the active switch again. Which action does the active switch take?
A. It suspends traffic forwarding until the new switch is updated with the current running configuration of the stack.
B. It clears the MAC table of the stack and relearns the attached devices.
C. It removes any Layer 3 configuration on the new switch to maintain normal Layer 2 functionality on the stack.
D. It checks the IOS and running configuration of the new switch and updates them if necessary to match the other switches in the stack.

Answer: D

Explanation 

Question 23
An engineer must configure a router to allow users to run specific configuration commands by validating the user against the router database. Which configuration must be applied?
A. aaa authorization exec default local
B. aaa authorization network default local
C. aaa authentication exec default local
D. aaa authentication network default local

Answer: A

Explanation
“allow users to run specific configuration commands” which means authorization, not authentication so we need the “aaa authorization …” command.

“Enable AAA authorization with the network keyword to allow interface configuration from the RADIUS server.” -> Answer B is not correct.

Reference: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst4500/12-2/31sga/configuration/guide/config/dot1x.html

-> Only answer A is left. We need the keyword “exec” to allow user to run an EXEC shell.

Question 24
What is a common trait between Ansible and Chef?
A. Both are used for mutable infrastructure.
B. Both rely on a declarative approach.
C. Both require a client to be installed on hosts.
D. Both rely on NETCONF.

Answer: A

Explanation
Ansible is a procedural tool, meaning that each Ansible playbook defines the steps to transform your infrastructure or configuration into what it should look like.

Chef is procedural, meaning that rather than defining the end state, you write configuration code to determine how your infrastructure setup should eventually look.

-> Answer B is not correct.

Reference: https://redpanda.com/blog/ansible-terraform-chef-salt-puppet-cloud

Ansible is Agentless while Chef is Agent Based Architecture. Agentless means that the managed device does not need any code (agent) to be installed on it. Therefore Ansible uses SSH (NETCONF over SSH in particular) to “push” changes and extract information to managed devices.

Ansible_Puppet_Chef_compare.jpg

-> Answer C is not correct.

Ansible uses SSH/NETCONF while Chef use REST -> Answer D is not correct.

Note: The concept for mutable and immutable infrastructure is whether or not an environment can change after its creation. While a mutable environment allows changes to be made during its lifecycle, like fixing configuration errors and updating the resources that are already provisioned, in an immutable environment, that would not be possible. The resource is destroyed and created again with a new version.

Question 25
Which device, in a LISP routing architecture, receives and de-encapsulates LISP traffic for endpoints within a LISP-capable site?
A. MR
B. ETR
C. OMS
D. ITR

Answer: B

Explanation

Egress Tunnel Router (ETR) is the device (or function) that connects a site to the LISP-capable part of a core network (such as the Internet), publishes EID-to-RLOC mappings for the site, responds to Map-Request messages, and decapsulates and delivers LISP-encapsulated user data to end systems at the site. During operation, an ETR sends periodic Map-Register messages to all its configured map servers.

Question 26
What is used by vManage to interact with Cisco SD-WAN devices in the fabric?
A. IPsec
B. northbound API

We can use python xmltodict module to read XML file and convert it to Dict or JSON data.

Question 28
What are two benefits of using Cisco TrustSec? (Choose two)
A. advanced endpoint protection against malware
B. end-to-end traffic encryption
C. consistent network segmentation
D. simplified management of network access
E. unknown file analysis using sandboxing

Answer: CD

Explanation
Cisco TrustSec simplifies the provisioning and management of secure access to network services and applications. Unlike access control mechanisms that are based on network topology, Cisco TrustSec policies use logical groupings, so access is consistently maintained even as resources are moved in mobile and virtualized networks.

Reference: https://www.zones.com/images/pdf/cisco-trustsec.pdf

Question 29
Which action occurs during a Layer 3 roam?
A. The client receives a new ip address after authentication occurs
B. The client is marked as “Foreign” on the original controller
C. Client database entry is moved from the old controller to the new controller
D. Client traffic is tunneled back to the original controller after a Layer 3 roam occurs

Answer: D

Explanation
In instances where the client roams between APs that are connected to different WLCs and the WLC WLAN is connected to a different subnet, a Layer 3 roam is performed, and there is an update between the new WLC (foreign WLC) and the old WLC (anchor WLC) mobility databases.

If this is the case, return traffic to the client still goes through its originating anchor WLC. The anchor WLC uses Ethernet over IP (EoIP) to forward the client traffic to the foreign WLC, to where the client has roamed. Traffic from the roaming client is forwarded out the foreign WLC interface on which it resides; it is not tunneled back. (-> Answer D is not correct). But this is contradict to what is said in the Official Cert Guide book:

“A Layer 3 intercontroller roam consists of an extra tunnel that is built between the client’s original controller and the controller it has roamed to. The tunnel carries data to and from the client as if it is still associated with the original controller and IP subnet.” 

Layer3_roaming_wlc.jpgThe client begins with a connection to AP B on WLC 1. This creates an ANCHOR entry in the WLC client database. As the client moves away from AP B and makes an association with AP C, WLC 2 sends a mobility announcement to peers in the mobility group looking for the WLC with the client MAC address. WLC 1 responds to the announcement, handshakes, and ACKs. Next the client database entry for the roaming client is copied to WLC 2, and marked as FOREIGN. Included PMK data (master key data from the RADIUS server) is also copied to WLC 2. This provides fast roam times for WPA2/802.11i clients because there is no need to re-authenticate to the RADIUS server.

After a simple key exchange between the client and AP, the client is added to the WLC 2 database and is similar, except that it is marked as FOREIGN.

Reference: https://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/solutions/Enterprise/Mobility/emob30dg/TechArch.html

In Layer 3 roaming, no IP address refresh needed (although client must be re-authenticated and new security session established) -> Answer A is not correct.

In summary, the “Mobility State” of a client is described below:
+ Before roaming: Mobility State = Local
+ After roaming: Mobility State on Old Database = Anchor; Mobility State on New Database = Foreign

Therefore the client entry on the original controller is not passed to the database totally. The client entry is still on the old controller but it is marked “Anchor” (not “Foreign”) -> Answer B is not correct.

Answer C is not correct as the “Client database entry is not moved, but copied to the new controller.

-> Therefore the best choice should be answer D.

Question 30
The Radio Resource Management software that is embedded in the Cisco WLC acts as a manager to constantly monitor over-the-air metrics. Which other factor does the Radio Resource Management software detect?
A. end-node vulnerabilities
B. unauthorized wireless network access
C. presence of rogue APs or malicious SSIDs
D. repeated attempts to authenticate to a wireless network

Answer: C

Explanation
The Radio Resource Management (RRM) software embedded in the Cisco Wireless LAN Controller acts as a built-in RF engineer to consistently provide real-time RF management of your wireless network. RRM enables Cisco WLCs to continually monitor their associated lightweight access points.

Reference: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/wireless/controller/8-8/config-guide/b_cg88/radio_resource_management.html

One of the functions of RRM is Radio Resource Monitoring.

RRM automatically detects and configures new Cisco WLCs and lightweight access points as they are added to the network. It then automatically adjusts associated and nearby lightweight access points to optimize coverage and capacity.
Lightweight access points can simultaneously scan all valid 5-GHz and 2.4-GHz channels for the country of operation as well as for channels available in other locations. The access points go “off-channel” for a period not greater than 60 ms to monitor these channels for noise and interference. Packets collected during this time are analyzed to detect rogue access points, rogue clients, ad-hoc clients, and interfering access points.

A. Option A
B. Option B
C. Option C
D. Option D

Answer: D

Explanation
A JSON string should always start with {} (an object) or [] (an array) -> Option C is not correct.

In a JSON string, the key/value pairs are always in double quotes "" -> Option A and Option B are not correct.

Question 37
A customer deployed an ISE solution that allows for web authentication and URL redirect enforced from the access layer. Due to control plane security concerns, only host IP 10.0.1.25 should have HTTP access to these switches. Which configuration must be applied to the switches?

Option A
ip access-list standard 10 
 deny 10.0.1.25 0.0.0.0 
 permit any 
 ip http server 
 ip http secure-server

 ip http secure-active-session-modules none 
 ip http active-session-modules none 
 ip http access-class HOST-ACL

A. Option A
B. Option B
C. Option C
D. Option D

Answer: B

Explanation
Option A and Option C use CoPP but they do not solve the problem with “conform-action permit” (in fact it should be “conform-action transmit”). With Option A, host 10.0.1.25 is allowed unconstrained (deny 10.0.1.25 which means CoPP is not applied to this host) while other hosts are applied CoPP. But with “conform-action transmit”, these hosts can still access the devices.

The “ip http access-class” command can only be used with a standard ACL in the range 0 to 99 -> Only Option B is correct.

Question 38
An engineer must construct an access list for a Cisco Catalyst 9800 Series WLC that will redirect wireless guest users to a splash page that is hosted on a Cisco ISE server. The Cisco ISE servers are hosted at 10.9.11.144 and 10.1.11.141. Which access list meets the requirements?

Option A
ip access-list extended ACL_WEBAUTH_REDIRECT
 70 deny ip any host 10.9.11.141
 80 deny ip any host 10.1.11.141
 500 permit tcp any any eq www
 600 permit tcp any any eq 443
 700 permit tcp any any eq 8443
 800 deny udp any any eq domain

Option B
ip access-list extended ACL_WEBAUTH_REDIRECT
 50 deny ip host 10.9.11.141 any 
 60 deny ip any host 10.9.11.141
 70 deny ip host 10.1.11.141 any 
 80 deny ip any host 10.1.11.141 
 500 permit tcp any any eq www
 600 permit tcp any any eq 443
 700 permit tcp any any eq 80

Option C
ip access-list extended ACL_WEBAUTH_REDIRECT
 70 permit ip any host 10.9.11.141
 80 permit ip any host 10.1.11.141
 500 permit tcp any any eq www
 800 permit tcp any any eq 443
 700 permit tcp any any eq 8443
 800 deny udp any any eq domain

Option D
ip access-list extended ACL_WEBAUTH_REDIRECT
 70 permit ip any host 10.9.11.141
 80 permit ip any host 10.1.11.141
 500 deny tcp any any eq www
 600 deny tcp any any eq 443
 700 deny tcp any any eq 8443
 800 deny udp any any eq domain
 901 deny ip any any

A. Option A
B. Option B
C. Option C
D. Option D

Answer: B

Explanation
For the redirection ACL, think of the deny action as a deny redirection (not deny traffic) and the permit action as permit redirection. The WLC only looks into traffic that it can redirect (ports 80 and 443 by default).

CLI:

ip access-list extended REDIRECT
 deny ip any host <ISE-IP>
 deny ip host <ISE-IP> any
 deny udp any any eq domain
 deny udp any eq domain any
 permit tcp any any eq 80
Reference: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/wireless/catalyst-9800-series-wireless-controllers/213920-central-web-authentication-cwa-on-cata.html

-> Option B is the best choice.

Question 39
Drag and drop the snippets onto the blanks within the code to construct a script that blocks a MAC address.

event manager applet mac_block
event timer ___________ time 10
action 01 cli command "enable"
action 02 cli command "ter len 0"
action 03 cli command "show mac add"
action 04 regexp "_____________" match ports
action 05 if $_regexp_result eq _________________
action 06 cli command "conf t"
action 07 cli command "int $ports"
action 08 cli command "shut"
action 09 end

A. Gig
B. 1
C. Watchdog

Answer: CAB

Explanation
The “watchdog” keyword specifies that an event is triggered when the specified time counts down to zero. The timer automatically resets to the initial value and continues to count down.

The statement “action 04 regexp “(Gi…)” match Ports” means if any GigabitEthernet interface is found in the “show mac address-table 0050.7966.6800” then save the result in “Ports” variable.

The statement “action 05 if $_regexp_result eq 1” means if a match is found then perform below commands.

Switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q
Switchport trunk allowed vlan 1,10,20,30,40
Channel-group 5 mode desirable

Users in the Operations VLAN on Switch A are unable to communicate with users in the Operations VLAN on Switch B. Which action resolves the issue?
A. Set the switchport mode to dynamic desirable on Switch B.
B. Set the EtherChannel mode to LACP on Switch A.
C. Configure the same allowed VLAN list on Switch A and Switch B.
D. Set the EtherChannel mode to PAGP on Switch B.

Answer: A

Explanation
Answer B is not correct as we can use either PAgP or LACP.

Answer C is not correct as we only care about Operations VLAN, which is VLAN 30. This VLAN was allowed on both switches.

Answer D is not correct as PAGP has been configured already on both switches.

Therefore only answer A is left and this is the correct choice. We tested with above configuration, the Port-channel interface was still up but with “static access” operating mode:

SwitchB#show interface port-channel 5 switchport
Name: Po5
Switchport: Enabled
Administrative Mode: dynamic auto
Operational Mode: static access
Administrative Trunking Encapsulation: dot1q
Operational Trunking Encapsulation: native
Negotiation of Trunking: On
Access Mode VLAN: 1 (default)
Trunking Native Mode VLAN: 1 (default)
Administrative Native VLAN tagging: enabled
--output omitted--
Trunking VLANs Enabled: 1,10,20,30,40
Pruning VLANs Enabled: 2-1001
But after changing to “dynamic desirable” on Switch B (use the “switchport mode dynamic desirable” under physical interfaces), the operating mode changed to trunk:

SwitchB#show interface port-channel 5 switchport
Name: Po5
Switchport: Enabled
Administrative Mode: dynamic desirable
Operational Mode: trunk
Administrative Trunking Encapsulation: dot1q
Operational Trunking Encapsulation: dot1q
Negotiation of Trunking: On
Access Mode VLAN: 1 (default)
Trunking Native Mode VLAN: 1 (default)
Administrative Native VLAN tagging: enabled
--output omitted--
Trunking VLANs Enabled: 1,10,20,30,40
Pruning VLANs Enabled: 2-1001
The reason is shown in the table below. If both ends are “dynamic auto” then a trunk cannot be formed. But with one end configures as “dynamic desirable” then a trunk is formed:
