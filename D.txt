Question 2
What is a characteristic of traffic shaping?
A. drops out-of-profile packets
B. can be applied in both traffic directions
C. queues out-of-profile packets until the buffer is full
D. causes TCP retransmits when packets are dropped

Answer: C

Explanation
Traffic shaping can be applied to outgoing direction only. Traffic shaping queues excess traffic by holding packets inside a shaping queue (buffer) -> Answer C is correct.

Note: The portion of the traffic that causes the flow to exceed its QoS limit is referred to as out‑of‑profile packets.

Question 3
Why would an architect use an OSPF virtual link?
A. to merge two existing Area 0s through a nonbackbone
B. to allow a stub area to transit another stub area
C. to connect a nonbackbone area to Area 0 through another nonbackbone area
D. to connect two networks that have overlapping private IP address space

Answer: C

Explanation
In fact there are two correct answers here:

All areas in an Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) autonomous system must be physically connected to the backbone area (Area 0). In some cases, where this is not possible, you can use a virtual link to connect to the backbone through a non-backbone area (-> Answer C is correct). You can also use virtual links to connect two parts of a partitioned backbone through a non-backbone area (-> Answer A is correct).

Reference: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/open-shortest-path-first-ospf/47866-ospfdb7.html

But if we have to choose one then answer C is better as it is used more popularly than answer A.

Question 13
Drag and drop the code snippets from the bottom onto the blanks in the script to convert a Python object into a JSON string. Not all options are used.

Import json

Data = {
...
}

Obj = json._____________()._______________(_____________)

A. data
B. JSONEncoder
C. encode
D. decode
E. JSONDecoder


Answer:BCA

1. JSONEncoder
2. encode
3. data

Explanation
JSONEncoder class is used for serialization of any Python object while performing encoding. It contains three different methods of encoding which are:
+ default(obj) – Implemented in the subclass and return serialize object for o object.
+ encode(obj) – Same as JSON dumps Python method return JSON string of Python data structure.
+ iterencode(obj) – Represent string one by one and encode object.


Question 15
Refer to the exhibit.

SW1
monitor session 1 type rpsan-dest
source remote vlan 50
dest int gig0/1

SW2
monitor session 1 type rpsan-source
source vlan 60
dest remote vlan 50

An engineer must send the 172.16.2.0/24 user traffic to a packet capture tool to troubleshoot an issue. Which action completes the configuration?
A. Disable the spanning tree protocol on the monitoring server VLAN.
B. Enable the Cisco Discovery Protocol on the server interfaces.
C. Encrypt the traffic between the users and the monitoring servers.
D. Define the remote span VLAN on SW1 and SW2.

Answer: D

Explanation
We need to define the remote span VLAN on both switches as well:

SW1(config)#vlan 50
SW1(config-vlan)#remote-span

SW2(config)#vlan 50
SW2(config-vlan)#remote-span
Note: In this question, SW2 captures all VLAN 60 traffic and send them to SW1 via VLAN 50.

Question 16
What is one characteristic of Cisco DNA Center and vManage northbound APIs?
A. They push configuration changes down to devices.
B. They implement the RESTCONF protocol.
C. They exchange XML-formatted content.
D. They implement the NETCONF protocol.

Answer: C

Explanation
Answer A answer B and answer D are not correct as they are characteristics of southbound APIs, not northbound.

Answer C is the best choice as both DNA Center and vManage use REST APIs, which can use XML or JSON as data formats for exchanging information between the client and the server.

Question 17
High bandwidth utilization is occurring on interface Gig0/1 of a router. An engineer must identify the flows that are consuming the most bandwidth. Cisco DNA Center is used as a flow exporter and is configured with the IP address 192.168.23.1 and UDP port 23000. Which configuration must be applied to set NetFlow data export and capture on the router?

Option A
R1(config)# ip flow-export
R1(config)# ip flow-export destination 192.168.23.1 23000
R1(config)# interface Gig0/1
R1(config-if)# ip flow monitor

Option B
R1(config)# ip flow-export
R1(config)# ip flow-export destination 192.168.23.1
R1 (config)# interface Gig0/1
R1(config-if)# collect counter bytes
R1(config-if)# collect counter packets

Option C
R1(config)# ip flow-export version 9
R1(config)# ip flow-export destination 192.168.23.1 23000
R1(config)# interface Gig0/1
R1(config-if)# ip flow ingress
R1(config-if)# ip flow egress

Option D
R1(config)# ip flow-export version 9
R1(config)# ip flow-export destination 192.168.23.1 23000
R1(config)# interface Gig0/1
R1(config-if)# ip flow-top-talkers

A. Option A
B. Option B
C. Option C
D. Option D

Answer: C

Explanation
The default UDP port is 2055 but we need port 23000 in this question so we have to manually configure it with “ip flow-export destination 192.168.23.1 23000” command. Also the “collect counter bytes” & “collect counter packets” must be placed under flow record, not under interface mode -> Option B is not correct.

The syntax of “ip flow monitor …” command is ip flow monitor {monitor_name} -> Option A is not correct.

The “top talkers” feature must be configured under global configuration mode, not interface mode -> Option D is not correct.

-> Only Option C is left.

Question 18
Refer to the exhibit.

A network engineer must use a Python script to convert data received from a network device. Which type of data is printed to the console when the script runs?
A. dictionary with a key-value pair
B. list of strings
C. tuple list
D. list of lists

Answer: A

Explanation
We created initial variables to test this script and print the type of the result:

The type of the result is “dictionary”.

Code explanation:

line.split("=>"): This part splits the input string line into a list of substrings using the “=>” delimiter. For example, if line is “vlan1 => 10”, line.split("=>") would produce ['vlan1 ', ' 10'].

[word.strip() for word in line.split("=>")]: This is a list comprehension that iterates over each element in the list obtained from the previous step (line.split("=>")). For each element word, the strip() method is applied to remove leading and trailing whitespace. This results in a new list of cleaned-up strings.

k, v = [word.strip() for word in line.split("=>")]: This unpacks the two elements of the list into the variables k and v. In the example of “vlan1 => 10”, after this line of code, k would be assigned the value “vlan1” (with leading and trailing spaces removed), and v would be assigned the value “10” (with leading and trailing spaces removed).

In summary, this line of code is used to extract key-value pairs from a string by splitting it based on the “=>” delimiter and removing any extra whitespace around the keys and values.

Question 23A
An engineer creates the configuration below. Drag and drop the authentication methods from the left into the order of priority on the right. Not all options are used.

R1#sh run | i aaa

aaa session-id common
R1#

Which is tried first?
A. AAA_RADIUS group
B. Deny
C. ACE group
D. local

Answer: C

Explanation
The “aaa authentication login default group ACE group AAA_RADIUS local-case” command is broken down as follows:

+ The ‘aaa authentication’ part is simply saying we want to configure authentication settings.
+ The ‘login’ is stating that we want to prompt for a username/password when a connection is made to the device.
+ The ‘default’ means we want to apply for all login connections (such as tty, vty, console and aux). If we use this keyword, we don’t need to configure anything else under tty, vty and aux lines. If we don’t use this keyword then we have to specify which line(s) we want to apply the authentication feature.
+ The ‘group ACE group AAA_RADIUS” means all users are authenticated using group ACE (the first method). If the credentials are not found on this group, then the group AAA_RADIUS is used (the second method).
+ The ‘local-case‘ option uses case-sensitive local usernames.

Question 29
What is the result of this python program (3*5)% ?
A. 7
B. 7.5
C. 0
D. 1

Answer: D

Explanation
This question is missing a number after “%”. From the answers, we believe the number after “%” is 2 so the full question is (3*5)%2 so the result is 1.

Note: The % symbol in Python is called the Modulo Operator. It returns the remainder of dividing the left hand operand by right hand operand. It’s used to get the remainder of a division problem.

Question 30
How are control traffic, client authentication and data traffic handled in a mobility express environment?
A. Control traffic and client authentication is handled centrally by the controller. Data traffic is switched centrally by the controller.
B. Control traffic and client authentication is handled centrally by the controller. Data traffic is switched locally by the access points.
C. Control traffic and client authentication is handled locally by each access point. Data traffic is switched locally by the access points.
D. Control traffic and client authentication is handled locally by each access point. Data traffic is switched centrally by the controller.

Answer: B

Question 31
Which Cisco DNA Center Assurance feature verifies host reachability?
A. detail information
B. application experience
C. path trace
D. network time travel

Answer: C

Explanation
When you initiate a path trace, the Cisco DNA Center controller reviews and collects network topology and routing data from the discovered devices. It then uses this data to calculate a path between the two hosts or Layer 3 interfaces, and displays the path in a path trace topology. The topology includes the path direction and the devices along the path, including their IP addresses.

After unsuccessfully configuring an EtherChannel link, an engineer enables debugging. Which action will resolve the issue?
A. Set the EtherChannel to mode active.
B. Set the EtherChannel to mode on.
C. Configure the EtherChannel members in desirable mode.
D. Configure the EtherChannel members in passive mode.

Answer: C

Explanation
From the line “PAgP not enabled on agport Po2”, we can deduce PAgP has not been configured correctly on this Po2. So we should configure it in desirable mode.

An engineer must prevent VLAN 20 routes from appearing in the routing table of Switch-1. Which command set must be applied?

Option A
On Switch-2:
router ospf 1
distribute-list 1 in
access-list 1 deny 192.168.2.0 0.0.0.255

Option B
On Switch-2:
router ospf 1
distribute-list 1 out
access-list 1 permit 192.168.2.0 0.0.0.255

Option C
On Switch-1:
router ospf 1
distribute-list 1 out
access-list 1 deny 192.168.2.0 0.0.0.255

Option D
On Switch-1:
router ospf 1
distribute-list 1 in
access-list 1 deny 192.168.2.0 0.0.0.255

A. Option A
B. Option B
C. Option C
D. Option D

Answer: D

Explanation
There are two ways to prevent VLAN 20 routes from appearing in the routing table of Switch-1 with distribute-list:
+ Deny this route on Switch-1 inbound direction so Switch-1 will not learn about this route
+ Deny this route on Switch-2 outbound direction so Switch-2 will not advertise this route

-> We must use an access-list with a “deny” statement for 192.168.2.0/24 -> Only Option D is correct.

But there is a mistake in this question as we must allow other prefixes (routes) to be learned with the “access-list 1 permit any” statement under above “deny” statement. Otherwise all other prefixes will be dropped as well.

Question 36
What is the purpose of data modeling languages?
A. to translate encoded data for interoperability between different CPU architectures

Answer: B

Question 37
Refer to the exhibit.

Router(config)#clock timezone EST -5 0
Router(config)#clock summer-time EDT recurring
Router(config)#clock calendar-valid
Router(config)#ntp master
Router(config)#interface vlan 3
Router(config-if)#ntp broadcast

What are two results of the NTP configuration? (Choose two)
A. It distributes the time via NTP broadcast packets.
B. It distributes the time via NTP broadcast and multicast packets.
C. It uses other systems as an authoritative time source.
D. It uses the hardware clock as an authoritative time source.
E. It forms a peer association with another system.

Answer: AD

Explanation
The command “clock timezone EST -5 0” is used to set the time zone on a Cisco device. “EST” is the abbreviation for the “Eastern Standard Time” zone. “-5” value represents the time zone offset from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). In this example, it is set to -5 hours. If your time zone is ahead of UTC, you would use a positive value; if it’s behind, you use a negative value. The last parameter (0 in this case) represents whether or not daylight saving time (DST) is in effect. A value of 0 means that DST is not observed.

The command “clock summer-time EDT recurring” is used to configure daylight saving time (DST) on a Cisco device.

The command “clock calendar-valid” enables the router to act as a valid time source to which network peers can synchronize. By default, the time maintained on the software clock is not considered to be reliable and will not be synchronized with NTP or VINES time service -> Answer D is correct.

The command “ntp broadcast” enables the interface to send NTP broadcast packets to a peer. If we want to use multicast for NTP synchronization, we must use the “ntp multicast” command instead -> Answer C is correct while answer B is not correct.

With all of the above commands, the local router becomes an authoritative NTP server and broadcast NTP messages to NTP clients.

Question 38
Refer to the exhibit.

event manager applet Config
event cli pattern "config term" ___________
action 1.0 cli command "enable"

An engineer constructs an EEM applet to prevent anyone from entering configuration mode on a switch. Which snippet is required to complete the EEM applet?
A. sync yes skip yes
B. sync no skip yes
C. sync no skip no
D. sync yes skip no 

Answer: B

Explanation
When you use the “sync yes” option in the event cli command, the EEM applet runs before the CLI command is executed. The EEM applet should set the _exit_status variable to indicate whether the CLI command should be executed (_exit_status set to one) or not (_exit_status set to zero). But in this question we don’t use the _exit_status variable so we have to use the “syn no” option -> Only answer B and answer C are correct.

With the “sync no” option, the EEM applet is executed in background in parallel with the CLI command. As the CLI command starts at the same time as the EEM applet, you cannot use the _exit_status variable anymore; you have to specify whether you want the CLI command to execute with the skip yes|no option of the event cli command. In this question, we want to ignore the “configure terminal” command so we have to set the “skip yes” option -> Only answer B is correct.

Reference: https://blog.ipspace.net/2011/01/eem-event-cli-command-options-and.html

Question 39
What is a characteristic of vManage?
A. It leverages the overlay management protocol to interface with WAN Edge devices.
B. It uses NETCONF to configure vSmart devices to build the overlay network data plane.
C. It requires a public IP address to allow WAN Edge devices to discover fabric components.
D. It supports protocols such as OSPF to integrate with legacy network devices.

Answer: B

Explanation
Centralized policies are built using vManage, and then stored in its database. They are then sent via NETCONF to the vSmart controller to become a part of vSmart configurations.-> Answer B is correct.

The vSmart controller then uses Overlay Management Protocol (OMP) to send the policy parameters as updates in the routing protocol to all of the WAN edge devices -> Answer A is not correct.

    G0/1 - 172.24.206.0/24
    G0/0 - 10.165.231.0/24

CR2 and CR3 are configured with OSPF. Which configuration, when applied to CR1, allows CR1 to exchange OSPF information with CR2 and CR3 but not with other network devices or on new interfaces that are added to CR1?

A. router ospf 1

network 172.27.206.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
network 172.24.206.0 0.0.0.255 area 0

Answer: D

Explanation
By using the correct and exact network and subnet masks, CR1 will not turn on OSPF on new interfaces and it cannot exchange OSPF with other network devices by other interfaces than Gi0/0 & Gi0/1.

In this question we should understand that these commands make sure CR1 cannot form OSPF neighbor relationship with other routers directly (on a new interface). If it is connected through a switch then surely it can form OSPF neighbor relationship. For example if we add a new router to SW3 in the 10.165.231.0/24 subnet then surely it will create OSPF neighbor relationshipo with CR1.

Answer “router ospf 1
network 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255 area 0
passive-interface GigabitEthernet0/2″

is not correct because if CR1 has a new interface then OSPF will also be turned on that interface.
Answer “interface Gi0/2
ip ospf 1 area 0
!
router ospf 1
passive-interface GigabitEthernet0/2″

is not correct as OSPF is not run on Gi0/1 and CR1 and CR3 cannot exchange OSPF information.

Question 41

Question 44
Which configuration saves the running configuration to the startup configuration and logs a “saving configuration automatically” message when a syslog message that contains “SYS-5-CONFIG_I” is received’?

Option A
event manager applet saveconfig 
 event syslog pattern "SYS-5-CONFIG_I" period 1 
 event track 1 
 action 1.0 cli command "write mem" 
 action 2.0 syslog msg "saving configuration automatically"

Option B
event manager applet save_config
 action 1.0 string match "SYS-5-CONFIG_I" save_config
 action 2.0 cli command "write mem"
 action 3.0 syslog msg "saving configuration automatically"

Option C
event manager applet save_config
 event syslog pattern "SYS-5-CONFIG_I" period 1
 action 1.0 cli command "end"
 action 2.0 cli command "write mem
 action 3.0 syslog msg "saving configuration automatically"

Option D
event manager applet save_config
 event syslog pattern "SYS-5-CONFIG_I" period 1
 action 1.0 cli command "write mem"
 action 2.0 syslog msg "saving configuration automatically"

A. Option A
B. Option B
C. Option C
D. Option D 

Answer: D

Explanation
To use the “string match” keyword, we should use “?” and “*” to match the whole string or it will return false. For example we should use: action 1.0 string match “*SYS-5-CONFIG_I*” save_config

When we receive the pattern “SYS-5-CONFIG_I”, that means we have just configured something and exited configuration mode. In the example below, we will see the syslog “%SYS-5-CONFIG_I” message after exit the configuration mode:

-> Therefore we don’t need the “end” command -> Option D is correct.

Question 45

Question 46
Refer to the exhibit.

Channel Assignment - Auto
Avoid Foreign AP interference - Enabled
Avoid Cisco AP load - Disabled
Avoid non-802.11a noise - Enabled
Avoid Persistent Non-Wifi Interference - Disabled
DCA Channel Sensitivity - Medium
Channel Width - 40 MHz
EDRRM - Disabled

An engineer is troubleshooting an issue with non-Wi-Fi interference on the 5-GHz band. The engineer has enabled Cisco CleanAir and set the appropriate traps, but the AP does not change the channel when it detects significant interference. Which action will resolve the issue?
A. Enable the Event Driven Radio Resource Management option
B. Change the DCA Sensitivity option to High
C. Enable the Avoid Persistent Non-WiFi interference option
D. Disable the Avoid Foreign AP Interference option

Answer: C

Explanation
DRRM is a feature that allows an access point that is in distress to bypass normal RRM intervals and immediately change channels. A CleanAir access point always monitors AQ and reports the AQ every 15 minutes. AQ only reports classified interference devices. The key benefit of EDRRM is fast action time.

Reference: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/wireless/controller/9800/16-12/config-guide/b_wl_16_12_cg/cisco-cleanair.html

Note: Non-wifi interference are non 802.11 devices. These devices include microwave ovens, cordless phones, Bluetooth devices, wireless video cameras, outdoor microwave links, wireless game controllers, Zigbee devices, fluorescent lights, WiMAX, and so on.

for key,value in args_dict.items():
   txt='{:#<15} : {:#<10}'.format(key,str(value))
   print(txt)

What is the output of this code?

A. 1st_item####### : 8791871446
at_must_display: jlugyydt

B. 1st_item#######: 645298791871446
2nd_item_that_must_display: jlugyydt##

C. 1st_item#######: 6452987918
2nd_item_that_m: jlugyydt##

D. 645298791871446
##jlugyydt

Answer: B

Explanation
The “{:#<15} : {:#<10}” is the string format which includes two placeholders. Both placeholders are left-aligned strings, padded with the # character if they are not long enough. The first placeholder is 15 characters long, and the second placeholder is 10 characters long.

The “format(key,str(value))” part inserts the values of the key and value variables into the string format.

Question 48
Refer to the exhibit.

hostname router 
ip domain-name cisco.com

line vty 0 15 
session-timeout 30 
exec-timeout 120 0 
login local

Which configuration must be added to enable remote access only using SSHv1 or SSHv2 to this router?

Option A
R1(config)# crypto key generate rsa modulus 2048
R1(config)# line vty 0 15
R1(config-line)# transport input ssh

Option B
R1(config)# ip ssh version 2
R1(config)# line vty 0 15
R1(config-line)# transport input ssh
R1(config-line)# transport output ssh

Option C
R1(config)# crypto key generate rsa modulus 2048
R1(config)# ip ssh version 2
R1(config)# line vty 0 15
R1(config-line)# transport input all

Option D
R1(config)# line vty 0 15
R1(config-line)# transport input ssh
R1(config-line)# transport output ssh

A. Option A
B. Option B
C. Option C
D. Option D

Answer: A

Explanation
To enable remote access via SSH, we only need the “transport input ssh” (not “transport output ssh”).

The command “crypto key generate rsa modulus 2048” is required to generate the RSA key with key-size of 2048 bits.

The “login local” command means that authentication uses locally configured credentials using the “username … password/secret …” command. Therefore in fact we need to configure an username and password on this device as well.

Steps to configure SSH:
1. Configure the router hostname using command “hostname”.
2. Configure the domain name using command “ip domain-name”.
3. Generate public and private keys using command “crypto key generate rsa”.
4. Create a user in the local database using command “username…secret”.
5. Allow only SSH access on VTY lines using command “transport input ssh”.

Question 51
Which two actions are recommended as security best practices to protect REST API? (Choose two)
A. Enable out-of-band authentication
B. Use a password hash
C. Use TACACS+ authentication
D. Use SSL for encryption
E. Enable dual authentication of the session

Answer: BD

Explanation
Passwords must always be hashed to protect the system (or minimize the damage) even if it is compromised in some hacking attempts. There are many such hashing algorithms that can prove really effective for password security e.g. PBKDF2, bcrypt, and scrypt algorithms. -> Answer B is correct.

By always using SSL, the authentication credentials can be simplified to a randomly generated access token. The token is delivered in the username field of HTTP Basic Auth. It’s relatively simple to use, and you get a lot of security features for free. -> Answer D is correct.

RESTful APIs should be stateless – so request authentication/authorization should not depend on sessions -> Answer E is not correct.

Reference: https://restfulapi.net/security-essentials/

Question 52
How do the MAC address table and TCAM differ?
A. TCAM is populated from the ARP file, and the MAC address table is populated from the switch configuration file
B. TCAM stores Layer 2 forwarding information, and the MAC address table stores QoS information
C. TCAM is a type of memory and the MAC address table is a logical structure
D. TCAM lookups can match only 1s and 0s, and MAC address lookups can match 1s, 0s and a third “care/don’t care” state

Answer: C

Explanation
When using Ternary Content Addressable Memory (TCAM) inside routers it’s used for faster address lookup that enables fast routing.

MAC address table is contented in Content Addressable Memory (CAM), which is used for building and lookup of mac address table that enables L2 forwarding decisions.

Question 55
What does the Cisco WLC Layer 3 roaming feature allow clients to do?
A. maintain their IP address when roaming to an AP or controller with a different client VLAN assignment
B. maintain their connection between APs even when the AP management VLANs are different
C. maintain their connection even if the client IP address changes when roaming
D. roam seamlessly between controllers even when the controller management VLANs are different

Answer: A

Explanation
When a client starts an intercontroller roam, the two WLCs compare the VLAN IDs allocated to their WLAN interfaces. If the VLAN IDs are the same, then the client performs a Layer 2 intercontroller roam and keeps using its original IP address on the new AP and WLC. If the VLAN IDs are different, the WLCs will arrange a Layer 3 or local-to-foreign roam, allowing the client to continue using its current IP address.

Question 61
Which hypervisor requires a host OS to run and is not allowed to directly access the hosts hardware and resources?
A. native
B. bare metal
C. type 1
D. type 2

Answer: D

Explanation
In contrast to type 1 hypervisor, a type 2 hypervisor (or hosted hypervisor) runs on top of an operating system and not the physical hardware directly. A big advantage of Type 2 hypervisors is that management console software is not required. Examples of type 2 hypervisor are VMware Workstation (which can run on Windows, Mac and Linux) or Microsoft Virtual PC (only runs on Windows).

Question 62

A network engineer must permit administrators to automatically authenticate if there is no response from either of the AAA servers. Which configuration achieves these results?
A. aaa authentication login default group tacacs+ line
B. aaa authentication login default group radius
C. aaa authentication enable default group radius local
D. aaa authentication login default group radius none

Answer: D

Explanation
If “automatically authenticate” means no authentication is required then answer D is correct with keyword “none” (requires no authentication if “radius” servers fails).

If “automatically authenticate” means authentication with local database of the router then answer C is correct with keyword “local” (requires authentication with local username & password).

But maybe this question implied “no authentication is required” so answer D is better.

Question 63
What is a characteristic of Cisco DNA southbound APIs?
A. implements monitoring by using the SOAP protocol
B. enables orchestration and automation of network devices based on intent
C. utilizes REST API
D. simplifies management of network devices

Answer: D

Explanation
Only Northbound APIs uses REST API -> Answer C is not correct. Also Northbound APIs are also called “Intent APIs” -> Answer B is not correct.

SOAP is a Northbound API -> Answer A is not correct.

Answer D is the best choice as Southbound API is used to communicated with network devices.

Question 64
How is OAuth framework used in REST API?
A. by providing the external application a token that authorizes access to the account
B. by providing the user credentials to the external application
C. as a framework to hide the security information in the REST URL
D. as a framework to hash the security information in the REST URL 

Answer: A

Explanation
Auth0 generates access tokens for API authorization scenarios, in JSON web token (JWT) format. The permissions represented by the access token, in OAuth terms, are known as scopes. When an application authenticates with Auth0, it specifies the scopes it wants. If those scopes are authorized by the user, then the access token will represent these authorized scopes.

How is CAPWAP data traffic encapsulated when running an Over the Top WLAN in a Cisco SD-Access wireless environment?
A. LISP
B. VXLAN
C. GRE
D. IPsec

Answer: B

Explanation
In SD-Access Wireless, the control plane is centralized. This means that, as with Cisco Unified Wireless Network, a Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP) tunnel is maintained between APs and WLC. The main difference is that in SD-Access Wireless, the data plane is distributed using a Virtual Extensible LAN (VXLAN) directly from the fabric-enabled APs.

Question 75
What are two characteristics of a directional antenna? (Choose two)
A. commonly used to cover large areas
B. low gain
C. provides the most focused and narrow beam-width
D. receive signals equally from all directions
E. high gain

Answer: CE

Explanation
A directional antenna transmits or receives signals in a specific direction only. Unlike omnidirectional antennas, directional antennas have a more focused beam designed to concentrate more energy in a single direction. This makes them more powerful than omnidirectional antennas and better suited for long-distance transmission.

Directional antennas have a higher signal gain than omnidirectional ones, allowing them to transmit signals over longer distances. This makes them the ideal choice for applications that require a more focused and specific transmission range. For instance, directional antennas are often used for satellite communication, radio astronomy, and long-distance wireless networking.

Which are related to the RIB? (Choose three)

A. It is built directly from the routing table
B. It is known as an IP routing table
C. It is build from information obtained from dynamic routing protocols, connected, and static routes
D. Each routing protocol has its own information base

Answer: BCD

Explanation
Each routing protocol like OSPF, EIGRP has its own Routing information base (RIB) and they select their best candidates to try to install to global RIB so that it can then be selected for forwarding. In order to view the RIB table, use the command “show ip ospf database” for OSPF, “show ip eigrp topology” for EIGRP or “show ip bgp” for BGP. To view the Forwarding Information Base (FIB), use the “show ip cef” command. RIB is in Control plane while FIB is in Data plane.

The Forwarding Information Base (FIB) contains destination reachability information as well as next hop information. This information is then used by the router to make forwarding decisions. The FIB allows for very efficient and easy lookups. Below is an example of the FIB table:

The FIB maintains next-hop address information based on the information in the IP routing table (RIB). In other words, FIB is a mirror copy of RIB.

RIB is in Control plane (and it is not used for forwarding) while FIB is in Data plane (and it is used for forwarding).

Question 79
An engineer is implementing a new SSID on a Cisco Catalyst 9800 Series WLC that must be broadcast on 6 GHz radios. Users will be required to use EAP-TLS to authenticate. Which wireless Layer 2 security method is required?
A. WPA2 Enterprise
B. WPA2 Personal
C. WPA3 Enterprise
D. WPA3 Personal

Answer: C

Explanation
EAP-TLS (Extensible Authentication Protocol with Transport Layer Security) is a more secure and scalable method, especially suitable for enterprise environments. It involves the use of digital certificates for both the client and the authentication server, providing a strong mutual authentication mechanism.

For enterprise deployments with the requirement of EAP-TLS, you should opt for WPA3-Enterprise or WPA2-Enterprise, depending on the compatibility of your devices.

WPA2-Enterprise uses EAP-TLS for authentication. It provides a high level of security but is based on older security standards.

WPA3-Enterprise is the latest Wi-Fi security standard and introduces improvements over WPA2. It supports EAP-TLS and includes additional security enhancements.

-> Therefore using WPA3 Enterprise is the better solution.

Question 86A
Drag and drop the QoS mechanisms from the left onto their descriptions on the right.
Which describes QoS shaping?
A. bandwidth management technique which delays datagrams
B. tool to enforce rate-limiting on ingress/egress
C. portion of the 802.1Q header used to classify packets

Answer: A

Explanation
Class of Service (CoS) is a 3 bit field within an Ethernet frame header when we use 802.1q which supports virtual LANs on an Ethernet network. This field specifies a priority value which is between 0 and 63 inclusive which can be used in the Quality of Service (QoS) to differentiate traffic.

Traffic policing is also known as rate limiting as it propagates bursts. When the traffic rate reaches the configured maximum rate (or committed information rate), excess traffic is dropped (or remarked). The result is an output rate that appears as a saw-tooth with crests and troughs.

Traffic shaping retains excess packets in a queue and then schedules the excess for later transmission over increments of time -> It causes delay.

Question 87
Drag and drop the code snippets from the bottom onto the blanks in the Python script to print the device model to the screen and write JSON data to a file. Not all options are used.

import json

data = {
....
}
____________ (data["devices"][0]["model"]
with ____________ ("data.json", "___________") as file:
json._____________ (data, file, incident=4)

A. dumps
B. print
C. dump
D. open
E. r
F. w

Answer: BDFC

1. print
2. open
3. w
4. dump

Explanation
This Python code defines a dictionary called data and then display the value associated with the key model in the first dictionary of the devices list. This will output the string “Cisco Nexus 3550”.

The code then opens a file called “data.json” in write mode using a with statement. The "w" in the second argument of the open() function indicates that the file should be opened in write mode.

The json.dump() method is then used to write the contents of the data dictionary to the “data.json” file in JSON format. The first argument to json.dump() is the dictionary to be written, the second argument is the file object to write to, and the indent parameter is set to 4 to make the output more readable.

We also tested this code and this is the result (file data.json is also created):

Question 92
When should the MAC authentication bypass feature be used on a switch port?
A. when the attached host supports 802.1X and must authenticate itself based on its MAC address instead of user credentials
B. when the attached host supports limited 802.1X
C. when authentication should be bypassed for select hosts based on their MAC address
D. when authentication is required, but the attached host does not support 802.1X

Answer: D

Explanation
802.1x is a great way to protect your network by authenticating everything you connect to your switch ports, However, one disadvantage of 802.1X is that your end devices have to support it. If you can’t use 802.1X but still want to secure your switch ports somehow, you can use MAC Authentication Bypass (MAB).

When you enable MAB on a switchport, the switch drops all frames except for the first frame to learn the MAC address. Pretty much any frame can be used to learn the MAC address except for CDP, LLDP, STP, and DTP traffic. Once the switch has learned the MAC address, it contacts an authentication server (RADIUS) to check if it permits the MAC address.

Question 93
To which category does a REST API that has been developed for IP address management integration belong?
A. southbound
B. eastbound
C. northbound
D. westbound

Answer: D

Explanation
+ Westbound (Integration) APIs: provide the capability to publish the network data, events and notifications to the external systems and consume information in Cisco DNA Center from the connected systems. Through integration APIs, Cisco DNA Center platform can power end-to-end IT processes across the value chain by integrating various domains such as IT Service Management (ITSM), IP address management (IPAM), and reporting.

Question 94
Which template is used when multiple templates are grouped together to run in succession in Cisco DNA Center?
A. regular
B. composite
C. project
D. configuration

Answer: B

Explanation
Composite templates allow for the reuse of multiple regular templates, which will enable us to modularize our code for reuse, thereby using smaller chunks of configuration. Composite templates also allow us one place to make changes that affect a broader set of devices. Thus, if we upgrade one regular template applied to multiple composite templates, we may effect change on a broader set of devices. This also allows us to reduce the duplication of efforts and minimize the administrator’s amount of effort.

Question 95
An engineer applies this configuration to router R1.

username cisco privilege 15 noescape secret 5 F7u$9cyE438490035m8TQ$nv&6502x
username cisco autocommand show startup-config
aaa authentication login default local-case enable
aaa authorization exec default local

How does R1 respond when the user ‘cisco’ logs in?
A. It places the user into EXEC mode and permits the user to execute any command
B. It displays the startup config and then permits the user to execute commands
C. It places the user into EXEC mode but permits the user to execute only the show startup-config command
D. It displays the startup config and then terminates the session

Answer: D

Explanation
The line “username cisco autocommand show startup-config” causes the specified command (“show startup-config” in this case) to be issued automatically after the user logs in. After the “autocommand” is executed, the user is logged out and the session is disconnected, unless you configure the “username user nohangup” option, which causes the session to remain active, giving the operator another login prompt.

The “noescape” keyword prevents a user from using an escape character on the host to which that user is connected.

Question 97
Which tag defines the roaming domain and properties of an AP deployment?
A. RF tag
B. policy tag
C. AP tag
D. site tag

Answer: D

Explanation
If custom/named site-tags are used, then all APs in the same named-site tags are assigned to the same WNCd. Consider site tag = roaming domain.

Reference: https://www.ciscolive.com/c/dam/r/ciscolive/global-event/docs/2023/pdf/BRKEWN-2338.pdf

Note:
Site Tag: Assigns the AP Join profile settings to the AP. The site tag defines the properties of a site, both central and remote (FlexConnect) site. The attributes of a site that are common across central and remote site are part of the AP Join profile.

The DevOps team noticed missing NetFlow data during peak utilization times for remote branches. Which configuration allows for this issue to be minimized or resolved?
A. Configure NetFlow on the in and outbound directions.
B. Configure long byte counters when specifying a flow record.
C. Change the transport type from UDP to TCP.
D. Change the flow monitor to IPv6 from IPv4.

Answer: B

Explanation
The “long” keyword enables collecting the total number of bytes or packets from the flow using a 64-bit counter rather than a 32-bit counter.

Reference: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios/fnetflow/command/reference/fnf_book/fnf_01.html#wp1305223

During peak utilization times, 32-bit counter may not be enough -> Answer B is the best choice.

Other answers are not correct as this issue is only observed in peak times.

Reference: https://blogs.cisco.com/developer/coding-essentials

Question 100
What is the function of an RP in a PIM-SM network?
A. to connect multicast sources with receivers
B. to track sources and receivers on the shared distribution tree
C. to automate the distribution of group-to rendezvous point mappings
D. to provide routing to the PIM leaf routers

Answer: A

Explanation
The concept of joining the rendezvous point (RP) is called the RPT (Root Path Tree) or shared distribution tree. The RP is the root of our tree which decides where to forward multicast traffic to. Each multicast group might have different sources and receivers so we might have different RPTs in our network.

An RP acts as the meeting place for sources and receivers of multicast data. In a PIM-SM network, sources must send their traffic to the RP. This traffic is then forwarded to receivers down a shared distribution tree

Reference: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/ipmulti_pim/configuration/xe-3s/imc-pim-xe-3s-book/imc_pim_allowrp.pdf

Answer B is not correct as a RP is the meeting point of sources and receivers only. It does not “track” sources and receivers.

Answer C is not correct as it is a function of Auto-RP: Auto-RP uses IP multicast to automate the distribution of group-to-RP mappings to all Cisco routers and multilayer switches in a PIM network.

Reference: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/metro/me3600x_3800x/software/release/12-2_52_ey/configuration/guide/swmcast.html

Answer D is surely not correct as RP does not “provide routing”.

Question 1
How do OSPF and EIGRP compare?
A. EIGRP shows all known routes, and OSPF shows successor and feasible successor routes.
B. Both OSPF and EIGRP use the concept of areas.
C. OSPF and EIGRP use the same administrative distance.
D. EIGRP shows successor and feasible successor routes, and OSPF shows all known routes.

Answer: D

Explanation
This question mentions about the EIGRP topology table (with command “show ip eigrp topology”), which keeps all the Successor and Feasible Successor routes. OSPF topology table (with command “show ip ospf database”) contains the entire road map of the network with all available OSPF routers.

Question 2
By default, which virtual MAC address does HSRP group 41 use?
A. 0c:5e:ac:07:0c:29
B. 00:05:0c:07:ac:41
C. 004:41:73:18:84:29
D. 00:00:0c:07:ac:29

Answer: D

Explanation
HSRP version 1 uses the MAC address range 0000.0C07.ACxx while HSRP version 2 uses the MAC address range 0000.0C9F.Fxxx.

The last two-digit hex value in the MAC address presents the HSRP group number. In this case 29 in decimal is 10 in hexadecimal. -> Answer D is correct.

Question 3
What is a characteristic of Layer 3 roaming?
A. Clients must obtain a new IP address when they roam between APs
B. It is only supported on controllers that run SSO.
C. It provides seamless client roaming between APs in different Layer 3 networks but within the same mobility group
D. It provides seamless roaming between APs that are connected to different Layer 3 networks and different mobility groups.

Answer: D

Explanation
Layer 3 roaming in wireless networks typically takes place between different mobility groups (but in the same mobility doamin). A mobility group refers to a set of WLCs that share information to facilitate client roaming.

When a client device roams between access points controlled by different WLCs within the same mobility group, it’s usually referred to as layer 2 roaming. In this scenario, the client maintains its IP address and session as it moves between access points, and the WLCs coordinate handoffs seamlessly.

However, when a client roams between access points controlled by WLCs in different mobility groups, it’s considered layer 3 roaming. In this case, the client may need to obtain a new IP address and establish a new session as it moves between different subnets or networks managed by different WLCs.

Question 4
Which element is unique to a Type 2 hypervisor?
A. memory
B. VM OS
C. host OS
D. host hardware

Answer: C

Explanation
“host OS” means “Underlying operating system”. In contrast to type 1 hypervisor, a type 2 hypervisor (or hosted hypervisor) runs on top of an operating system (and this is called host OS) and not the physical hardware directly.

Question 5
Refer to the exhibit.

A. The operation runs 300 times a day
B. The operation runs 5000 times a day
C. The rate is configured to repeat every 5 minutes
D. IP SLA is scheduled to run at 3 a.m

Answer: C

Explanation
“frequency 300” means it runs every 300 seconds (5 minutes).

Question 6
Which method requires a client to authenticate and has the capability to function without encryption?
A. open
B. WEP
C. WebAuth
D. PSK

Question 8
Refer to the exhibit.

event manager applet CONFIG_BACKUP
action 1.0 cli command "enable"
action 3.0 cli command "end"
action 4.0 cli command "exit"

write_backup.tcl
set output [exec "copy run backup"]
set fd [open "flash:/backup.txt" "w"]
puts $fd $output
close $fd

ios_config "file prompt quiet" "end"
copy flash:/backup.txt tftp://10.1.1.23/backup.txt
ios_config "no file prompt quiet" "end"
file delete -force "flash:/backup.txt"

Which statement is needed to complete the EEM applet and use the Tcl script to store the backup file?
A. action 2.0 cli command “write_backup.tcl tcl”
B. action 2.0 cli command “flash:write_backup.tcl”
C. action 2.0 cli command “write_backup.tcl”
D. action 2.0 cli command “tclsh flash:write_backup.tcl”

Answer: D

Explanation
In order to run the “write_backup.tcl” file with Tcl script we need to use start the EEM applet with “tclsh …” command. Also notice that “action 2.0” will be put under “action 1.0” and above “action 3.0” so this Tcl script will be run after “enable” and before “end” command.

For your information, this Tcl script will do the following things:

+ ios_config “file prompt quiet” “end”: This command configures the device to suppress prompts for confirmation when performing file operations. It sets the device to not prompt the user when it is saving or copying files.

+ copy flash:/backup.txt tftp://10.1.1.23/backup.txt: This command copies a file named “backup.txt” from the device’s flash memory to a TFTP server located at the IP address 10.1.1.23. This is likely used for backing up configurations or other important files.

+ ios_config “no file prompt quiet” “end”: This command restores the default behavior of the device, enabling prompts for confirmation during file operations.

+ file delete -force “flash:/backup.txt”: This command deletes the “backup.txt” file from the device’s flash memory. The -force flag is used to bypass any confirmation prompts and delete the file immediately.

Question 9
What is a characteristics of Wi-Fi channels?
A. The 2.4-GHz band 2 non-overlapping channels
B. Devices that connect to the same Wi-Fi channel reside in the same collision domain.
C. Wi-Fi channels are spaced 30 MHz apart.
D. The 5-GHz band offers 11 different channels for Wi-Fi clients

Answer: B

Explanation
WiFi channels are smaller bands within WiFi frequency bands that are used by your wireless network to send and receive data. Depending on which frequency band your router is using, you have a certain number of WiFi channels to choose from:
+ 11 WiFi channels are in the 2.4 GHz frequency band (3 non-overlapping channels) -> Answer A is not correct.
+ 45 WiFi channels are in the 5 GHz frequency band (24 non-overlapping channels) -> Answer D is not correct.

Due to the WiFi standard, the channel spacing is 5 MHz. This causes that when the band is placed in a particular channel, for example, 6, there are 15MHz overlapping adjacent channels (part of 4, 5, 7, and 8) -> Answer C is not correct.

Question 10
Refer to the exhibit.

aaa new-model

username admin privilege 15 secret S3cr3tP4ss
!
ip http secure-server
ip http authentication aaa

An administrator must enable RESTCONF access to a router. Which two commands or command sets must be added to the existing configuration? (Choose two)

A. aaa authentication login default local
aaa authorization exec default local
B. restconf
C. username restconf privilege 0
D. netconf-yang

Answer: AB

Explanation
The CLI command to enable RESTCONF is displayed below:
restconf
Once enabled via CLI, all supported operations may be governed through model interfaces, including optional settings for RESTCONF configuration and operational data settings.

Reference: https://developer.cisco.com/docs/ios-xe/#!enabling-restconf-on-ios-xe/httphttps

Also we enable AAA so we need to configure suitable AAA commands for it.

Question 11
Which port is required to allow APs to join a WLC when directed broadcasts are used on a Cisco IOS switch?
A. UDP 5246
B. TCP 5246
C. TCP 5247
D. UDP 5247

Answer: A

Explanation
After the LAP gets an IP address from the DHCP server, the LAP broadcasts a Layer 3 CAPWAP discovery message on to its local subnet Normally these broadcast are limited to local subnet as it will not cross layer 3 boundaries.

Since CAPWAP broadcast uses UDP port 5246 it must be explicitly forwarded on the router. You have to use “ip forward-protocol udp <port-no>” CLI command for this.

Reference: https://mrncciew.com/2013/05/04/wlc-discovery-via-broadcast/

Question 12
Which security feature does stateless authentication and authorization use for REST API calls?
A. SSL/TLS certificate encryption
B. API keys
C. OAuth 2 token
D. Cookie-based session authentication

Answer: C

Explanation
Statelessness means that every HTTP request happens in complete isolation. When the client makes an HTTP request, it includes all information necessary for the server to fulfill the request.

The server never relies on information from previous requests from the client. If any such information is important then the client will send that as part of the current request.

Reference: https://restfulapi.net/statelessness/

TLS/SSL is stateful. The web server and the client (browser) cache the session including the cryptographic keys to improve performance and do not perform key exchange for every request. -> Answer A is not correct.

Cookie/Session Based Authentications are stateful. Here is how it works: The server creates a session ID upon a user’s login request, storing it in either a database or an in-memory cache on the server. This session ID is then stored on a cookie in the user’s browser. With each subsequent request, the server receives the cookie containing the session ID and validates the user’s identity by comparing it with the corresponding session information stored on the server. -> Answer D is not correct.

Token-based authentication enables users to obtain a token that allows them to access a service and/or fetch a specific resource without using their username and password to authenticate every request. Because the token can be a self-contained entity that conveys all the required information for authenticating the request, it is often referred to as stateless authentication.

The authentication token is created by the authenticating service and contains information to identify a particular user and the token validity. The token itself is cryptographically signed to prevent tampering.

After the token is validated by the service, it is used to establish security context for the client, so the service can make authorization decisions or audit activity for successive user requests -> Answer C is correct.

Reference: https://doubleoctopus.com/security-wiki/network-architecture/stateless-authentication/

When you use an API key to authenticate to an API, the API key does not identify a principal, nor does it provide any authorization information. -> Answer B is not correct.

Question 13

B. RESTCONF is not enabled on the device.
C. There is no BGP process running on the device

Answer: A

Explanation
After running this code, we received the message “HTTP Response: 404 Not Found” so answer A is the best choice.

Question 14
An engineer must configure HSRP for VLAN 1200 on SW1. The second switch is configured by using the last usable IP address in the network as the virtual IP. Which command set accomplishes this task?

Option A
SW1(config)#interface vlan 1200
SW1(config-if)#ip address 172.12.0.2 255.255.255.0
SW1(config-if)#standby 1200 ip 172.12.0.254
SW1(config-if)#standby 1200 timers 5 15
SW1(config-if)#standby 1200 preempt

Option B
SW1(config)#interface vlan 1200
SW1(config-if)#ip address 172.12.0.2 255.255.255.0
SW1(config-if)#standby version 2
SW1(config-if)#standby 1200 ip 172.12.0.254
SW1(config-if)#standby 1200 preempt

Option C
SW1(config)#interface vlan 1200
SW1(config-if)#ip address 172.12.0.1 255.255.255.0
SW1(config-if)#standby 1200 ip 172.12.0.254
SW1(config-if)#standby 1200 timers 5 15
SW1(config-if)#standby 1200 preempt

Option D
SW1(config)#interface vlan 1200
SW1(config-if)#ip address 172.12.0.254 255.255.255.0
SW1(config-if)#standby version 2
SW1(config-if)#standby 1200 ip 172.12.0.2
SW1(config-if)#standby 1200 preempt

A. Option A
B. Option B
C. Option C
D. Option D

Answer: B

Explanation
The group numbers of HSRP version 1 range from 0 to 255. HSRP does support group number of 0 (we do check it and in fact, it is the default group number if you don’t enter group number in the configuration) so HSRP version 1 supports up to 256 group numbers. HSRP version 2 supports 4096 group numbers so in this question we must configure HSRP version 2.

The virtual IP address must be the same on two HSRP switches so we must have command “standby 1200 ip 172.12.0.254” on both switches.

Question 15

Question 16
When the ”deny” statement is used within a route map that is used for policy-based routing, how is the traffic that matches the deny route-map line treated?
A. An additional sequential route-map line is needed to policy route this traffic.
B. Traffic is routed to the null 0 interface of the router and discarded.
C. An additional sequential route-map line is needed to divert the traffic to the router’s normal forwarding behavior.
D. Traffic is returned to the normal forwarding behavior of the router.

Answer: D

Explanation
Within a route map used for PBR, you can reference ACLs to match specific types of traffic. The deny statements in these ACLs are effectively ignored in the context of PBR. This means that when a packet matches a ‘deny’ statement in an ACL referenced by a route map for PBR, it is not actively denied; rather, it is not matched by the PBR policy and thus is processed using the regular routing table, not the PBR-defined path.

Question 19
What is the architectural difference between the MAC address table and TCAM?
A. TCAM entries are stored for 600 seconds, and MAC address table entries are kept for 200 seconds
B. TCAM entries are populated using the ARP table and the MAC address table is populated dynamically from outgoing frames
C. TCAM entries consist of VLAN port ID and source MAC Address, and MAC address table entries consist of source MAC address and port ID
D. TCAM entries are composed of value, mask, and result and MAC address table entries are composed of value and results

Answer: D

Explanation
Each TCAM entry consist of three components: Value, Mask and Result. -> Answer C is not correct.

Reference: https://learningnetwork.cisco.com/s/article/tcam-demystified

MAC address table entries are composted of value, which is an INDEX or key value (MAC) and looks up for a result value (port ID or VlanID) -> Answer D is correct.

The default aging time of MAC address entries is 5 minutes (300 seconds) -> Answer A is correct.

MAC address table is populated by incoming frames -> Answer B is not correct.

Question 20
What is a difference between OSPF and EIGRP?
A. OSPF is an advanced distance vector protocol, EIGRP is a link-state protocol.
B. OSPF is a hybrid routing protocol, EIGRP is a link-state routing protocol
C. OSPF uses the DUAL algorithm, EIGRP uses the SPF algorithm
D. OSPF uses an administrative distance of 110, EIGRP uses an administrative distance of 170.

Answer: D

Explanation
OSPF is a link-state routing protocol while EIGRP is an advanced distance vector protocol -> Answer A and answer B are not correct.

EIGRP uses DUAL algorithm while OSPF uses SPF algorithm -> Answer C is not correct.

OSPF administrative distance is 110 and EIGRP External route administrative distance is 170 -> Answer D is correct although it is tricky.

Question 21
Which Cisco WLC feature allows a wireless device to perform a Layer 3 roam between two separate controllers without changing the client IP address?
A. LWAPP tunnel
B. mobile IP
C. mobility tunnel
D. GRE tunnel

Answer: C

Explanation
The controller supports seamless roaming across multiple mobility groups. During seamless roaming, the client maintains its IP address across all mobility groups. When a client crosses a mobility group boundary during a roam, the client is fully authenticated, but the IP address is maintained, and mobility tunneling is initiated for Layer 3 roaming.

Reference: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/wireless/controller/8-5/config-guide/b_cg85/mobility_groups.html

Question 22
An engineer adds a new switch to a Cisco StackWise stack. The switch that was active before the switch was added is elected as the active switch again. Which action does the active switch take?
A. It suspends traffic forwarding until the new switch is updated with the current running configuration of the stack.
B. It clears the MAC table of the stack and relearns the attached devices.
C. It removes any Layer 3 configuration on the new switch to maintain normal Layer 2 functionality on the stack.
D. It checks the IOS and running configuration of the new switch and updates them if necessary to match the other switches in the stack.

Answer: D

Explanation 

Question 23
An engineer must configure a router to allow users to run specific configuration commands by validating the user against the router database. Which configuration must be applied?
A. aaa authorization exec default local
B. aaa authorization network default local
C. aaa authentication exec default local
D. aaa authentication network default local

Answer: A

Explanation
“allow users to run specific configuration commands” which means authorization, not authentication so we need the “aaa authorization …” command.

“Enable AAA authorization with the network keyword to allow interface configuration from the RADIUS server.” -> Answer B is not correct.

Reference: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst4500/12-2/31sga/configuration/guide/config/dot1x.html

-> Only answer A is left. We need the keyword “exec” to allow user to run an EXEC shell.

Question 24
What is a common trait between Ansible and Chef?
A. Both are used for mutable infrastructure.
B. Both rely on a declarative approach.
C. Both require a client to be installed on hosts.
D. Both rely on NETCONF.

Answer: A

Explanation
Ansible is a procedural tool, meaning that each Ansible playbook defines the steps to transform your infrastructure or configuration into what it should look like.

Chef is procedural, meaning that rather than defining the end state, you write configuration code to determine how your infrastructure setup should eventually look.

-> Answer B is not correct.

Reference: https://redpanda.com/blog/ansible-terraform-chef-salt-puppet-cloud

Ansible is Agentless while Chef is Agent Based Architecture. Agentless means that the managed device does not need any code (agent) to be installed on it. Therefore Ansible uses SSH (NETCONF over SSH in particular) to “push” changes and extract information to managed devices.

Ansible_Puppet_Chef_compare.jpg

-> Answer C is not correct.

Ansible uses SSH/NETCONF while Chef use REST -> Answer D is not correct.

Note: The concept for mutable and immutable infrastructure is whether or not an environment can change after its creation. While a mutable environment allows changes to be made during its lifecycle, like fixing configuration errors and updating the resources that are already provisioned, in an immutable environment, that would not be possible. The resource is destroyed and created again with a new version.

Question 25
Which device, in a LISP routing architecture, receives and de-encapsulates LISP traffic for endpoints within a LISP-capable site?
A. MR
B. ETR
C. OMS
D. ITR

Answer: B

Explanation

Egress Tunnel Router (ETR) is the device (or function) that connects a site to the LISP-capable part of a core network (such as the Internet), publishes EID-to-RLOC mappings for the site, responds to Map-Request messages, and decapsulates and delivers LISP-encapsulated user data to end systems at the site. During operation, an ETR sends periodic Map-Register messages to all its configured map servers.

Question 26
What is used by vManage to interact with Cisco SD-WAN devices in the fabric?
A. IPsec

Question 28
What are two benefits of using Cisco TrustSec? (Choose two)
A. advanced endpoint protection against malware
B. end-to-end traffic encryption
C. consistent network segmentation
D. simplified management of network access
E. unknown file analysis using sandboxing

Answer: CD

Explanation
Cisco TrustSec simplifies the provisioning and management of secure access to network services and applications. Unlike access control mechanisms that are based on network topology, Cisco TrustSec policies use logical groupings, so access is consistently maintained even as resources are moved in mobile and virtualized networks.

Reference: https://www.zones.com/images/pdf/cisco-trustsec.pdf

Question 29
Which action occurs during a Layer 3 roam?
A. The client receives a new ip address after authentication occurs
B. The client is marked as “Foreign” on the original controller
C. Client database entry is moved from the old controller to the new controller
D. Client traffic is tunneled back to the original controller after a Layer 3 roam occurs

Answer: D

Explanation
In instances where the client roams between APs that are connected to different WLCs and the WLC WLAN is connected to a different subnet, a Layer 3 roam is performed, and there is an update between the new WLC (foreign WLC) and the old WLC (anchor WLC) mobility databases.

If this is the case, return traffic to the client still goes through its originating anchor WLC. The anchor WLC uses Ethernet over IP (EoIP) to forward the client traffic to the foreign WLC, to where the client has roamed. Traffic from the roaming client is forwarded out the foreign WLC interface on which it resides; it is not tunneled back. (-> Answer D is not correct). But this is contradict to what is said in the Official Cert Guide book:

“A Layer 3 intercontroller roam consists of an extra tunnel that is built between the client’s original controller and the controller it has roamed to. The tunnel carries data to and from the client as if it is still associated with the original controller and IP subnet.” 

Layer3_roaming_wlc.jpgThe client begins with a connection to AP B on WLC 1. This creates an ANCHOR entry in the WLC client database. As the client moves away from AP B and makes an association with AP C, WLC 2 sends a mobility announcement to peers in the mobility group looking for the WLC with the client MAC address. WLC 1 responds to the announcement, handshakes, and ACKs. Next the client database entry for the roaming client is copied to WLC 2, and marked as FOREIGN. Included PMK data (master key data from the RADIUS server) is also copied to WLC 2. This provides fast roam times for WPA2/802.11i clients because there is no need to re-authenticate to the RADIUS server.

After a simple key exchange between the client and AP, the client is added to the WLC 2 database and is similar, except that it is marked as FOREIGN.

Reference: https://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/solutions/Enterprise/Mobility/emob30dg/TechArch.html

In Layer 3 roaming, no IP address refresh needed (although client must be re-authenticated and new security session established) -> Answer A is not correct.

In summary, the “Mobility State” of a client is described below:
+ Before roaming: Mobility State = Local
+ After roaming: Mobility State on Old Database = Anchor; Mobility State on New Database = Foreign

Therefore the client entry on the original controller is not passed to the database totally. The client entry is still on the old controller but it is marked “Anchor” (not “Foreign”) -> Answer B is not correct.

Answer C is not correct as the “Client database entry is not moved, but copied to the new controller.

-> Therefore the best choice should be answer D.

Question 30
The Radio Resource Management software that is embedded in the Cisco WLC acts as a manager to constantly monitor over-the-air metrics. Which other factor does the Radio Resource Management software detect?
A. end-node vulnerabilities
B. unauthorized wireless network access
C. presence of rogue APs or malicious SSIDs
D. repeated attempts to authenticate to a wireless network

Answer: C

Explanation
The Radio Resource Management (RRM) software embedded in the Cisco Wireless LAN Controller acts as a built-in RF engineer to consistently provide real-time RF management of your wireless network. RRM enables Cisco WLCs to continually monitor their associated lightweight access points.

Reference: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/wireless/controller/8-8/config-guide/b_cg88/radio_resource_management.html

One of the functions of RRM is Radio Resource Monitoring.

RRM automatically detects and configures new Cisco WLCs and lightweight access points as they are added to the network. It then automatically adjusts associated and nearby lightweight access points to optimize coverage and capacity.
Lightweight access points can simultaneously scan all valid 5-GHz and 2.4-GHz channels for the country of operation as well as for channels available in other locations. The access points go “off-channel” for a period not greater than 60 ms to monitor these channels for noise and interference. Packets collected during this time are analyzed to detect rogue access points, rogue clients, ad-hoc clients, and interfering access points.

A. Option A
B. Option B
C. Option C
D. Option D

Answer: D

Explanation
In the exhibit, the response.get method is used to retrieve information from the given server using a given URL so it cannot be used to configure a remote device. We should use PATCH (requests.patch) method instead.

Question 37
A customer deployed an ISE solution that allows for web authentication and URL redirect enforced from the access layer. Due to control plane security concerns, only host IP 10.0.1.25 should have HTTP access to these switches. Which configuration must be applied to the switches?

Option A
ip access-list standard 10 
 deny 10.0.1.25 0.0.0.0 
 permit any 
 ip http server 
 ip http secure-server 
 class-map CoPP_Class 
 match access_group 10 
 policy-map CoPP_Policy 
 class CoPP_Class
 police 100000 conform-action permit exceed-action drop violate-action drop 
 control-plane
 service-policy input CoPP_Policy

Option B
ip access-list standard 10 
 permit 10.0.1.25 0.0.0.0 
 ip http server 
 ip http secure-server
 ip http secure-active-session-modules none 
 ip http access-class 10

Option C
ip access-list extended HOST-ACL 
 10 permit host 10.0.1.25 any 
 20 deny any any 
 no ip http server 
 ip http secure-server 
 class-map CoPP_Class 
 match access_group HOST-ACL 
 policy-map CoPP_Policy 
 class CoPP_Class
 police 100000 conform-action permit exceed-action drop violate-action drop 
 control-plane
 service-policy input CoPP_Policy

Option D
ip access-list extended HOST-ACL
 10 permit host 10.0.1.25 any 
 20 deny any any 
 ip http server 
 ip http secure-server
 ip http secure-active-session-modules none 
 ip http active-session-modules none 
 ip http access-class HOST-ACL

A. Option A
B. Option B
C. Option C
D. Option D

Answer: B

Explanation
Option A and Option C use CoPP but they do not solve the problem with “conform-action permit” (in fact it should be “conform-action transmit”). With Option A, host 10.0.1.25 is allowed unconstrained (deny 10.0.1.25 which means CoPP is not applied to this host) while other hosts are applied CoPP. But with “conform-action transmit”, these hosts can still access the devices.

The “ip http access-class” command can only be used with a standard ACL in the range 0 to 99 -> Only Option B is correct.

Question 38
An engineer must construct an access list for a Cisco Catalyst 9800 Series WLC that will redirect wireless guest users to a splash page that is hosted on a Cisco ISE server. The Cisco ISE servers are hosted at 10.9.11.144 and 10.1.11.141. Which access list meets the requirements?

Option A
ip access-list extended ACL_WEBAUTH_REDIRECT
 70 deny ip any host 10.9.11.141
 80 deny ip any host 10.1.11.141
 500 permit tcp any any eq www
 600 permit tcp any any eq 443
 700 permit tcp any any eq 8443
 800 deny udp any any eq domain

Option B
ip access-list extended ACL_WEBAUTH_REDIRECT
 50 deny ip host 10.9.11.141 any 
 60 deny ip any host 10.9.11.141
 70 deny ip host 10.1.11.141 any 
 80 deny ip any host 10.1.11.141 
 500 permit tcp any any eq www
 600 permit tcp any any eq 443
 700 permit tcp any any eq 80

Option C
ip access-list extended ACL_WEBAUTH_REDIRECT
 70 permit ip any host 10.9.11.141
 80 permit ip any host 10.1.11.141
 500 permit tcp any any eq www
 800 permit tcp any any eq 443
 700 permit tcp any any eq 8443
 800 deny udp any any eq domain

Option D
ip access-list extended ACL_WEBAUTH_REDIRECT
 70 permit ip any host 10.9.11.141
 80 permit ip any host 10.1.11.141
 500 deny tcp any any eq www
 600 deny tcp any any eq 443
 700 deny tcp any any eq 8443
 800 deny udp any any eq domain
 901 deny ip any any

A. Option A
B. Option B
C. Option C
D. Option D

Answer: B

Explanation
For the redirection ACL, think of the deny action as a deny redirection (not deny traffic) and the permit action as permit redirection. The WLC only looks into traffic that it can redirect (ports 80 and 443 by default).

CLI:

ip access-list extended REDIRECT
 deny ip any host <ISE-IP>
 deny ip host <ISE-IP> any
 deny udp any any eq domain
 deny udp any eq domain any
 permit tcp any any eq 80
Reference: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/wireless/catalyst-9800-series-wireless-controllers/213920-central-web-authentication-cwa-on-cata.html

-> Option B is the best choice.

Question 39
Drag and drop the snippets onto the blanks within the code to construct a script that blocks a MAC address.

event manager applet mac_block
event timer ___________ time 10
action 01 cli command "enable"
action 02 cli command "ter len 0"
action 03 cli command "show mac add"
action 04 regexp "_____________" match ports
action 05 if $_regexp_result eq _________________
action 06 cli command "conf t"
action 07 cli command "int $ports"
action 08 cli command "shut"
action 09 end

Answer:
1. watchdog
2. (Gi…)
3. 1

Explanation
The “watchdog” keyword specifies that an event is triggered when the specified time counts down to zero. The timer automatically resets to the initial value and continues to count down.

The statement “action 04 regexp “(Gi…)” match Ports” means if any GigabitEthernet interface is found in the “show mac address-table 0050.7966.6800” then save the result in “Ports” variable.

The statement “action 05 if $_regexp_result eq 1” means if a match is found then perform below commands.

SWA=======================SWB

Operations - Vlan 30
Sales - Vlan 20

Users in the Operations VLAN on Switch A are unable to communicate with users in the Operations VLAN on Switch B. Which action resolves the issue?
A. Set the switchport mode to dynamic desirable on Switch B.
B. Set the EtherChannel mode to LACP on Switch A.
C. Configure the same allowed VLAN list on Switch A and Switch B.
D. Set the EtherChannel mode to PAGP on Switch B.

Answer: A

Explanation
Answer B is not correct as we can use either PAgP or LACP.

Answer C is not correct as we only care about Operations VLAN, which is VLAN 30. This VLAN was allowed on both switches.

Answer D is not correct as PAGP has been configured already on both switches.

Therefore only answer A is left and this is the correct choice. We tested with above configuration, the Port-channel interface was still up but with “static access” operating mode:

SwitchB#show interface port-channel 5 switchport
Name: Po5
Switchport: Enabled
Administrative Mode: dynamic auto
Operational Mode: static access
Administrative Trunking Encapsulation: dot1q
Operational Trunking Encapsulation: native
Negotiation of Trunking: On
Access Mode VLAN: 1 (default)
Trunking Native Mode VLAN: 1 (default)
Administrative Native VLAN tagging: enabled
--output omitted--
Trunking VLANs Enabled: 1,10,20,30,40
Pruning VLANs Enabled: 2-1001
But after changing to “dynamic desirable” on Switch B (use the “switchport mode dynamic desirable” under physical interfaces), the operating mode changed to trunk:

SwitchB#show interface port-channel 5 switchport
Name: Po5
Switchport: Enabled
Administrative Mode: dynamic desirable
Operational Mode: trunk
Administrative Trunking Encapsulation: dot1q
Operational Trunking Encapsulation: dot1q
Negotiation of Trunking: On
Access Mode VLAN: 1 (default)
Trunking Native Mode VLAN: 1 (default)
Administrative Native VLAN tagging: enabled
--output omitted--
Trunking VLANs Enabled: 1,10,20,30,40
Pruning VLANs Enabled: 2-1001
The reason is shown in the table below. If both ends are “dynamic auto” then a trunk cannot be formed. But with one end configures as “dynamic desirable” then a trunk is formed:

DTP Trunking modes

Question 41

Question 42
Which two advanced security features are available in next-generation firewalls but were not provided by standard firewalls? (Choose two)
A. network telemetry
B. intrusion prevention
C. stateful traffic inspection
D. remote access VPN
E. application control

Answer: BE

Explanation
Next-generation firewalls (NGFWs) are deep-packet inspection firewalls that move beyond port/protocol inspection and blocking to add application-level inspection, intrusion prevention, and bringing intelligence from outside the firewall.
