Question 1
Which option must be used to support a WLC with an IPv6 management address and 100 Cisco Aironet 2800 Series access points that will use DHCP to register?
A. 43
B. 52
C. 60
D. 82

Answer: B

Explanation
The CAPWAP protocol allows a lightweight access point (AP) to use DHCP to discover a wireless controller to which it is
connected to. Cisco lightweight APs running 8.0 and above support DHCP discovery for both IPv4 and IPv6 networks:
+ IPv4 – Cisco lightweight APs implement DHCP option 43 to supply the IPv4 management interface addresses of the
primary, secondary, and tertiary wireless controllers (see the guide).
+ IPv6 – Cisco lightweight APs implement DHCPv6 option 52 (RFC 5417) to supply the IPv6 management interface
addresses of the primary, secondary, and tertiary wireless controllers.
Reference: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/wireless/controller/technotes/8-0/IPV6_DG.html
This question asks about DHCPv6, not DHCPv4 so Option 52 is the best answer.

Which are related to Cisco Express Forwarding? (Choose two)
A. All forwarding decisions are made in software
B. All packets are switched using hardware
C. The forwarding table is created in advance.
D. The router processor is involved with every forwarding decision

Answer: BC

Explanation
 There are different switching methods to forward IP packets. Here are the different switching options:
 Process switching:
 All packets are examined by the CPU and all forwarding decisions are made in software...very slow!
 Fast switching (also known as route caching):
 The first packet in a flow is examined by the CPU; the forwarding decision is cached in hardware for the next packets in
 the same flow. This is a faster method.
 (CEF) Cisco Express Forwarding (also known as topology based switching):
 Forwarding table created in hardware beforehand. All packets will be switched using hardware. This is the fastest
 method but there are some limitations. Multilayer switches and routers use CEF.

Explanation

Question 3
An engineer must create a script to append and modify device entries in a JSON-formatted file. The script must work
 as follows:
 • Until interrupted from the keyboard, the script reads in the hostname of a device, its management IP address,
 operating system type, and CLI remote access protocol.
 • After being interrupted, the script displays the entered entries and adds them to the JSON-formatted file, replacing
 existing entries whose hostname matches.
 The contents of the JSON-formatted file are as follows:
      {
   "examplerouter": {
   "ip": "203.0.113.1",
   "os": ios-xe",
   "protocol": "ssh"
   },
   ...
   }

Drag and drop the statements onto the blanks within the code to complete the script. Not all options are used.
A. ?
B. ?
C. ?
D. ?

Answer: A

Explanation

 1. import json
 2. while True:
 3. except
 4. File = open
 5. File.close()

 We tested this code successfully:

  And this is the result:
 
 Note:
 + In Python, “pass” is a null statement. It is usually used as a placeholder.
 + In order to run the code successfully, we must have the “devicesData.json” first with at least one sample.
 + This code runs infinitely with “while True:” so we have to use Keyboard interrupt to exit (Ctrl-C in Windows, for
 example).

In which two ways does the routing protocol OSPF differ from EIGRP? (Choose two)
A. OSPF supports only equal-cost load balancing. EIGRP supports unequal-cost load balancing
B. OSPF supports an unlimited number of hops. EIGRP supports a maximum of 255 hops
C. OSPF is distance vector protocol. EIGRP is a link-state protocol
D. OSPF provides shorter convergence time than EIGRP
E. OSPF supports unequal-cost load balancing. EIGRP supports only equal-cost load balancing

Answer: AB

Explanation
 EIGRP supports unequal-cost load balancing via “variance” command -> Answer A is correct while answer E is not correct.
 Answer C is not correct obviously.
 The maximum number of hops that EIGRP will accept is 100 by default, the maximum can be configured to 225 with metric maximum hops -> Answer B is correct.
 Reference: https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/cisco-ios-in/0596008694/re597.html
  The network convergence time is faster than OSPF networks, because EIGRP network can learn the topology information and updates more rapidly -> Answer D is not correct.

What is one characteristic of VXLAN?
A. It supports a maximum of 4096 VLANs.
B. It supports multitenant segments.
C. It uses STP to prevent loops in the underlay network.
D. It uses the Layer 2 header to transfer packets through the network underlay.
  
Answer: B
 
Explanation
 VXLAN has a 24-bit VXLAN network identifier (VNI), which allows for up to 16 million (= 224) VXLAN segments to
 coexist within the same infrastructure -> Answer A is not correct.
 VXLAN does not use STP to prevent loops. It uses Equal-Cost Multi-Path (ECMP) links for load sharing and near-instant
 failure recovery -> Answer C is not correct.
 VXLAN offers the following benefits:
 VLAN flexibility in multitenant segments: It provides a solution to extend Layer 2 segments over the underlying
  network infrastructure so that tenant workload can be placed across physical pods in the data center.
 VXLAN uses Layer 3, not Layer 2 header to transfer packets through the underlay -> Answer D is not correct.

The OSPF neighborship fails between two routers. What is the cause of this issue?
A. The OSPF router ID is missing on this router.
B. The OSPF process is stopped on the neighbor router.
C. There is an MTU mismatch between the two routers.
D. The OSPF router ID is missing on the neighbor router.
  
Answer: C
 
Explanation
 Neighbors Stuck in Exstart/Exchange State
 The problem occurs most frequently when attempting to run OSPF between a Cisco router and another vendor’s router.
 The problem occurs when the maximum transmission unit (MTU) settings for neighboring router interfaces don’t match.
 If the router with the higher MTU sends a packet larger that the MTU set on the neighboring router, the neighboring router ignores the packet.

Virtual ip is 10.1.1.1
Active virtual MAC is 0000.0c9f.f001
Local virtual MAC is 0000.0c9f.f001 (vs default)
Hello time 3s, hold time 10 s
Next hello in 0.375s
Authentication MD5, key-string "Cisco"
Preemption enabled, delay min 5s
Active router 10.1.1.2, priority 255 (expires in 9.39s)
Standby is local
Priority 100 (default)
IP redundancy name is "hsrp-F1/0/47-1" (default)
  
An engineer configures HSRP and enters the show standby command. Which two facts about the network environment are derived from the output? (Choose two)
A. The local device has a higher priority than the active router
B. The virtual IP address of the HSRP group is 10.1.1.1
C. If the local device fails to receive a hello from the active router for more than 5 seconds, it becomes the active router
D. The hello and hold timers are set to custom values
E. If a router with a higher IP address and same HSRP priority as the active router becomes available, that router becomes the new active router 5 seconds later
  
Answer: BE
 
Explanation
 The local device has a priority of 100 which is smaller than the active router (priority 255) -> Answer A is not correct.
 From the line “Virtual IP address is 10.1.1.1” we learn answer B is correct.
 The holdtime is 10 seconds so the local router needs to wait 10 seconds before becoming the active router -> Answer
 C is not correct.
 The hello timer of 3 seconds and hold timer of 10 seconds are the default values -> Answer D is not correct.
 Therefore 0nly answer E is left although we cannot say it is totally correct.

 OutFile.close()
  
Answer: A
 
Explanation
 Response.text() returns a string so we can write directly to a file. But only “UpdatedConfig” variable contains the
 changed interface so we have to write it to a file.

C. malicious rogue rules on Cisco DNA Center
D. malicious rogue rules on the WLC
  
Answer: A
 
Explanation
 The Cisco Advanced Wireless Intrusion Prevention System (aWIPS) is a wireless intrusion threat detection and
 mitigation mechanism. The aWIPS uses an advanced approach to wireless threat detection and performance
 management. The AP detects threats and generates alarms. It combines network traffic analysis, network device and
 topology information, signature-based techniques, and anomaly detection to deliver highly accurate and complete
 wireless threat prevention.
 Because the aWIPS functionality is integrated into Cisco DNA Center, the aWIPS can configure and monitor WIPS
 policies and alarms and report threats.

D. RouterB(config)# router ospf 1
 RouterB(config-router)# area 2 range 192.168.36.0 255.255.252.0
  
Answer: D
 
Explanation
 OSPF offers two methods of route summarization:
 1) Summarization of internal routes performed on the ABRs
 2) Summarization of external routes performed on the ASBRs
 1) To summarize routes at the area boundary (ABRs), use the command:
 area area-id range ip-address mask [advertise | not-advertise] [cost cost]
 An internal summary route is generated if at least one subnet within the area falls in the summary address range and the summarized route metric is equal to the lowest cost of all the subnets within the summary address range.
 Interarea summarization can only be done for the intra-area routes of connected areas, and the ABR creates a route to Null0 to avoid loops in the absence of more specific routes.
 2) To summarize external routes on the domain boundary (ASBRs), use the command:
 summary-address {{ip-address mask} | {prefix mask}} [not-advertise] [tag tag]
 The ASBR will summarize external routes before injecting them into the OSPF domain as type 5 external LSAs.

E. R1(config)#control-plane
 R1(config-cp)# service-policy input POLICY-CoPP

Answer: DE
 
Explanation
 In this question, we must understand the difference between exceed-action and violate-action.
 Using a dual token bucket model allows traffic exceeding the normal burst rate (CIR) to be metered as exceeding and
 traffic that exceeds the excess burst rate to be metered as violating traffic.

Ip nat inside source static 10.1.1.1 209.165.201.1

What are two results of the NAT configuration? (Choose two)
A. R1 is performing NAT for inside addresses and outside address
B. R1 looks at the destination IP address of packets entering S0/0 and destined for inside hosts
C. Packets with a destination of 200.1.1.1 are translated to 10.1.1.1 or .2, respectively
D. A packet that is sent to 200.1.1.1 from 10.1.1.1 is translated to 209.165.201.1 on R1
E. R1 processes packets entering E0/0 and S0/0 by examining the source IP address
  
Answer: BD
 
Explanation
 This is Static address translation (static NAT): Allows one-to-one mapping between local and global addresses. Answer
 A is not correct as it is translating between “inside global” and “inside local” addresses so we cannot say it is
 performing NAT for outside address.
 Answer B is correct as if the destination address is 209.165.201.1 or .2 then it will translate to 10.1.1.1 or .2 and
 forward to inside hosts.
 Answer D is correct as all packets sent from 10.1.1.1 and .2 to outside are translated to 209.165.201.1 and .2.
 Note: The locations of “Inside”, “Outside” and “Serial0/0” text in the exhibit above are not correct.

Question 38 - Checked
How do the RIB and the FIB differ?
A. FIB contains routes learned through a dynamic routing protocol, and the RIB contains routes that are static or
 directly connected.
B. RIB contains the interface for a destination, and the FIB contains the next hop information.
C. FIB is derived from the control plane, and the RIB is derived from the data plane.
D. RIB is derived from the control plane, and the FIB is derived from the RIB.
  
Answer: D
 
Explanation
 Each routing protocol like OSPF, EIGRP has its own Routing information base (RIB) and they select their best candidates to try to install to global RIB so that it can then be selected for forwarding. In order to view the RIB table, use the command “show ip ospf database” for OSPF, “show ip eigrp topology” for EIGRP or “show ip bgp” for BGP. To view the Forwarding Information Base (FIB), use the “show ip cef” command. RIB is in Control plane while FIB is in Data plane.
 The Forwarding Information Base (FIB) contains destination reachability information as well as next hop information.
 This information is then used by the router to make forwarding decisions. The FIB allows for very efficient and easy lookups. Below is an example of the FIB table:
  The FIB maintains next-hop address information based on the information in the IP routing table (RIB). In other words, FIB is a mirror copy of RIB.
 RIB is in Control plane (and it is not used for forwarding) while FIB is in Data plane (and it is used for forwarding).
 
Question 39
What does a YANG model provide?
A. standardized data structure independent of the transport protocols
B. creation of transport protocols and their interaction with the OS
C. user access to interact directly with the CLI of the device to receive or modify network configurations
D. standardized data structure that can be used only with NETCONF or RESTCONF transport protocols
 
Answer: A
 
Explanation
 YANG (Yet Another Next Generation) is protocol independent, and YANG data models can be used independent of the  transport or RPC protocol and can be converted into any encoding format supported by the network configuration  protocol.
 Reference: https://www.juniper.net/documentation/us/en/software/junos/netconf/topics/concept/netconf-yang-overview.html
  Currently YANG can be used by NETCONF, RESTCONF and gRPC.
 
Question 40
A network engineer must configure a switch to allow remote access for all feasible protocols. Only a password must be requested for device authentication and all idle sessions must be terminated in 30 minutes. Which configuration must be applied?
A. line vty 0 15
 password cisco
 transport input all
 exec-timeout 0 30

B. line console 0
 password cisco
 exec-timeout 30 0

C. line vty 0 15
 password cisco
 transport input telnet ssh
 exec-timeout 30 0

D. username cisco privilege 15 cisco
 line vty 0 15
 transport input telnet ssh
 login local
 exec-timeout 0 30
  
Answer: C
 
Explanation
 The “exec-timeout” command is used to configure the inactive session timeout on the console port or the virtual terminal. The syntax of this command is:
 exec-timeout minutes [seconds]
 Therefore we need to use the “exec-timeout 30 0” command to set the user inactivity timer to 30 minutes.

If AP power level is increased from 25 mW to 100 mW, what is the power difference in dBm?
A. 6 dBm
B. 14 dBm
C. 17 dBm
D. 20 dBm
 
Answer: A
 
Explanation
 3 dB of gain = +3 dB = doubles signal strength (Let’s say, the base is P. So 10*log10(P/P)= 0 dB and 10*log10(2P/P) = 10*log10(2) = 3dB -> double signal)
 
Question 46
When does a Cisco StackWise primary switch lose its role?
A. when the priority value of a stack member is changed to a higher value
B. when a switch with a higher priority is added to the stack
C. when the stack primary is reset
D. when a stack member fails
  
Answer: C
 
Explanation
 The new priority value takes effect immediately but does not affect the current active switch. The new priority value helps determine which stack member is elected as the new active switch when the current active switch or the switch stack resets -> Answer A is not correct while answer C is correct.

A. CISCO.CONTROLLER.localdomain
B. CISCO.CAPWAP.CONTROLLER.localdomain
C. CISCO-CONTROLLER.localdomain
D. CISCO-CAPWAP-CONTROLLER.localdomain
  
Answer: D

Explanation
 The AP will attempt to resolve the DNS name CISCO-CAPWAP-CONTROLLER.localdomain. When the AP is able to resolve this name to one or more IP addresses, the AP sends a unicast CAPWAP Discovery Message to the resolved IP address(es). Each WLC that receives the CAPWAP Discovery Request Message replies with a unicast CAPWAP Discovery
 Response to the AP.

Question 49
Which NTP mode must be activated when using a Cisco router as an NTP authoritative server?
A. primary
B. server
C. broadcast client
D. peer
  
Answer: B
 
Explanation
 Cisco routers and switches can use 3 different NTP modes:
 NTP client mode.
 NTP server mode.
 NTP symmetric active mode.
 The symmetric active mode is used between NTP devices to synchronize with each other, it’s used as a backup mechanism when they are unable to reach the (external) NTP server.
 The NTP server can operate in master mode to serve time using the local clock, when it has lost synchronization.

Question 51
Which signal strength and noise values meet the minimum SNR for voice networks?
A. signal strength -67 dBm, noise 91 dBm
B. signal strength -69 dBm, noise 94 dBm
C. signal strength -68 dBm, noise 89 dBm
D. signal strength -66 dBm, noise 90 dBm
  
Answer: B
 
Explanation
 The recommended minimum SNR for voice applications on wireless networks is 25dB. The noise should be in negative number so if the question says “noise 91 dBm” we should understand: N = -91 dBm.
 If your SNR measurements are already in decibel form, then you can subtract the noise quantity from the desired signal: SNR = S – N. This is because when you subtract logarithms, it is the equivalent of dividing normal numbers.
 Also, the difference in the numbers equals the SNR. In this question, only “signal strength -69 dBm, noise 94 dBm” has SNR = -69 – (-94) = 25dB which is equal to the recommended minimum SNR for voice applications.

Which of the following are characteristics of Orchestration? (Choose two)
A. designed to install and manage software on existing servers
B. designed to provision the servers
C. immutable infrastructure
D. mutable infrastructure

Answer: BC

Explanation
 Configuration management (CM) tools are great at the config nodes but less good at coordinating complex tasks.
 Orchestration tools tend to leave configuration to specialist tools.
 Traditional server environments are mutable, in that they are changed after they are installed. Administrators are always making tweaks or adding code. CM tools evolved to manage this complexity and bring order to the  configuration and updating of tens to thousands of servers. An immutable infrastructure is one in which servers are
 never modified after they’re deployed. If something needs to be updated or changed, new servers are built afresh from a common template with the desired changes. This is the world of Terraform, where new servers replace the existing servers. This is also the philosophy of containers. With orchestration, immutability is easily applied to servers as they  usually have built-in support for managing the lifecycle of a resource from creation to tearing down.

Hosts PC1 PC2 and PC3 must access resources on Server1. An engineer configures NAT on Router R1 to enable the communication and enters the show command to verify operation. Which IP address is used by the hosts when they communicate globally to Server1?
A. 155.1.1.5
B. random addresses in the 155.1.1.0/24 range
C. their own address in the 10.10.10.0/24 range
D. 155.1.1.1
  
Answer: D

Explanation
 Note: Cisco uses the term inside local for the private IP addresses and inside global for the public IP addresses replaced by the router. Therefore hosts use the inside global to communicate globally to Server1.

Which technology reduces the implementation of STP and leverages both unicast and multicast?
A. VPC
B. VXLAN
C. VSS
D. VLAN
  
Answer: C
 
Explanation
 A VSS combines a pair of switches into a single network element -> It reduces STP.
 For Layer 3 multicast in the VSS, learned multicast routes are stored in hardware in the standby supervisor engine.
 After a switchover, multicast forwarding continues, using the existing hardware entries.
 Reference: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst6500/ios/15-
  4SY/config_guide/sup6T/15_3_sy_swcg_6T/virtual_switching_systems.pdf
  VXLAN solved Layer 2 STP limitations. VXLAN packets are transferred through the underlying network based on its  Layer 3 header and can take complete advantage of Layer 3 routing, equal-cost multipath (ECMP) routing, and link aggregation protocols to use all available paths.
 VXLAN uses Layer 3 routing so it also supports multicast. Therefore in fact we have two correct answers in this question.

D. R1(config)#no ip route 192.168.50.2 255.255.255.255 Gi0/0
  
Answer: C
 
Explanation
 The only difference between the iterations is “RIB-failure(17)”. But this is not an error. It means that we have another better route for 2.2.2.2 in our routing table so BGP route could not be installed into the routing table. So it may be a static route destined to 2.2.2.2.

An engineer applies this EEM applet to a router

Event manager applet Test
Event timer watchdog time 600
Action 1.0 cli command enable
Action 2.0 syslog msg "term exec prompt timestamp
Action 3.0 cli command "ter len 0"
Action 4.0 cli command "show ip arp | in 0005.2342.5342"
Action 5.0 regexp ".*(ARPA).*" $_cli_result
Action 6.0 if $_regexp_result eq 1
Action 7.0 syslog msg $_cli_result
Action 8.0 end

What does the applet accomplish?
A. It checks the MAC address table every 600 seconds to see if the specified address has been learned.
B. It compares syslog output to the MAC address table every 600 seconds and generates an event when no match is found.
C. It compares syslog output to the MAC address table every 600 seconds and generates an event when there is a match.
D. It generates a syslog message every 600 seconds on the status of the specified MAC address.
  
Answer: A
 
Explanation
 First let’s see the output of the “show ip arp” command:
  With the command “show ip arp | in 0005.4278.9866”, the “ARPR” text is only found if this MAC address has been learned in the router.
 Answer D is not correct as the syslog message is only generated if the specific MAC address is found (not every 600 seconds).

A network engineer must log in to the router via the console, but the RADIUS servers are not reachable. Which credentials allow console access?
A. the username “cisco” and the password “cisco123”
B. no username and only the password “test123”
C. no username and only the password “cisco123”
D. the username “cisco” and the password “cisco”
  
Answer: C
 
Explanation
 We tested with GNS3 and the router only requires password “cisco123” configured under line console to authenticate.
 So we can deduce the “password” command under line interface is preferred over “login authentication” command.
 
Question 4 - Checked
A customer transitions a wired environment to a Cisco SD-Access solution. The customer does not want to integrate the wireless network with the fabric. Which wireless deployment approach enables the two systems to coexist and meets the customer requirement?
A. Deploy a separate network for the wireless environment.
B. Implement a Cisco DNA Center to manage the two networks.
C. Deploy the wireless network over the top of the fabric.
D. Deploy the APs in autonomous mode.
  
Answer: C
 
Explanation
 Customers with a wired network based on SD-Access fabric have two options for integrating wireless access:
 + SD-Access Wireless Architecture
 + Cisco Unified Wireless Network Wireless Over the Top (OTT)
 OTT basically involves running traditional wireless on top of a fabric wired network.
 Why would you deploy Cisco Unified Wireless Network wireless OTT? There are two primary reasons:
 ...
 2. Another reason for deploying wireless OTT could be that customer doesn’t want or cannot migrate to fabric for wireless.

Which two solutions are used for backing up a Cisco DNA Center Assurance database? (Choose two)
A. NFS share
B. local server
C. non-linux server
D. remote server
E. bare metal server
  
Answer: AD
 
Explanation
 Cisco DNA Center creates the backup files and posts them to a remote server. Each backup is uniquely stored using the UUID as the directory name.
 To support Assurance data backups, the server must be a Linux-based NFS server that meets the following  requirements:
 Support NFS v4 and NFS v3.
 Cisco DNA Center stores backup copies of Assurance data on an external NFS device and automation data on an external remote sync (rsync) target location.
 The remote share for backing up an Assurance database (NDP) must be an NFS share.

Question 7
A customer wants to provide wireless access to contractors using a guest portal on Cisco ISE. The portal is also used by employees. A solution is implemented, but contractors receive a certificate error when they attempt to access the portal. Employees can access the portal without any errors. Which change must be implemented to allow the contractors and employees to access the portal?
A. Install a trusted third-party certificate on the Cisco ISE.
B. Install an internal CA signed certificate on the Cisco ISE.
C. Install a trusted third-party certificate on the contractor devices.
D. Install an internal CA signed certificate on the contractor devices.
  
Answer: A
 
Explanation
 It is recommended to use the Company Internal CA for Admin and EAP certificates, and a publicly-signed certificate for Guest/Sponsor/Hotspot/etc portals. The reason is that if a user or guest comes onto the network and ISE portal uses a privately-signed certificate for the Guest Portal, they get certificate errors or potentially have their browser block them from the portal page. To avoid all that, use a publicly-signed certificate for Portal use to ensure better user experience.
 Additionally, Each deployment node(s)’s IP address should be added to the SAN field to avoid a certificate warning when the server is accessed via the IP address.

Which IP address becomes the active next hop for 192.168.102.0/24 when 192.168.101.2 fails?
A. 192.168.101.10
B. 192.168.101.14
C. 192.168.101.6
D. 192.168.101.18
  
Answer: D
 
Explanation
 Path Selection Attributes: (highest) Weight > (highest) Local Preference > Originate > (shortest) AS Path > Origin
 > (lowest) MED > External > IGP Cost > eBGP Peering > (lowest) Router ID
 Besides 192.168.101.2, other next hops have the same weight attribute of 0 so we have to consider Local preference.
 There are two next hops with LocPrf of 100 which are 192.168.101.18 and 192.168.101.10 (The field of LocPrf is empty means the default Local Preference of 100). Next we compare their AS Path. The next hop 192.168.101.18 has shorter AS Path so it will be the active next hop when the current one fails.
 
Question 9
What is the API keys option for REST API authentication?
A. a predetermined string that is passed from client to server
B. a one-time encrypted token
C. a username that is stored in the local router database
D. a credential that is transmitted unencrypted

Answer: A
 
Explanation
 In REST API Security – API keys are widely used in the industry and became some sort of standard, however, this method should not be considered a good security measure.
 API Keys were created as somewhat of a fix to the early authentication issues of HTTP Basic Authentication and other such systems. In this method, a unique generated value is assigned to each first time user, signifying that the user is known. When the user attempts to re-enter the system, their unique key (sometimes generated from their hardware combination and IP data, and other times randomly generated by the server which knows them) is used to prove that they’re the same user as before.

D. with open(“ifaces.json”, “w”) as OutFile:
 OutFile.write(Response)
  
Answer: A
 
Explanation
 The json() method of the Response interface takes a Response stream and reads it to completion. It returns a promise which resolves with the result of parsing the body text as JSON.
 Response.text returns the content of the response (string), in unicode so we can write it to a file.
 Note: response.json() returns a JSON object of the result so it cannot be written to a file directly.

Answer: A
 
Explanation
 For the source session, we have to configure:
 + Unique session ID.
 + List of source interfaces or source VLANs that you want to monitor. Not all platforms support every possible source.
 + What traffic we want to capture: tx, rx or both.
 + Destination IP address for the GRE tunnel.
  + Origin IP address which is used as the source for the GRE tunnel.
 + Unique ERSPAN flow ID.
 + Optional: you can specify attributes like the ToS (Type of Service), TTL, etc.
 Reference: https://networklessons.com/cisco/ccie-routing-switching-written/erspan
  The configuration in the exhibit is missing destination IP address for the GRE tunnel so we have to add it with the “ip address 10.10.0.1”.

The administrator troubleshoots an Etherchannel that keeps moving to err-disabled. Which two actions must be taken to resolve the issue? (Choose two)
A. Reload the switch to force EtherChannel renegotiation
B. Ensure that interfaces Gi1/0/2 and Gi1/0/3 connect to the same neighboring switch
C. Ensure that the neighbor interfaces of Gi1/0/2 and Gi1/0/3 are configured as members of the same EtherChannel
D. Ensure that the corresponding port channel interface on the neighbor switch is named Port-channel1
E. Ensure that the switchport parameters of Port-channel 1 match the parameters of the port channel on the neighbor switch
  
Answer: CE

Explanation
 The errdisable status indicates that the port was automatically disabled by the switch operating system software because of an error condition encountered on the port.
 Check the EtherChannel configuration on both switches. If one side is configured for EtherChannel in the On mode, the peer ports must also be in On mode or they will go to errdisable.

A. All controller dependent activities stops working except DFS
B. Only clients on central switching WLANs stay connected
C. All clients roaming continues to work
D. All clients on all WLANs are disconnected

What is a TLOC in a Cisco SD-WAN deployment?
A. value that identifies a specific tunnel within the Cisco SD-WAN overlay
B. identifier that represents a specific service offered by nodes within the Cisco SD-WAN overlay
C. attribute that acts as a next hop for network prefixes
D. component set by the administrator to differentiate similar nodes that offer a common service
  
Answer: C
 
Explanation
 TLOCs serve another important function besides data plane connectivity. In OMP terms (the routing protocol used over the SD-WAN Fabric), the TLOC serves as a next-hop for route advertisements. OMP is very similar to BGP in many ways, and just as the next-hop must be resolvable for BGP to install a route, the same is true of OMP.

Question 29
Which Cisco FlexConnect state allows wireless users that are connected to the network to continue working after the connection to the WLC has been lost?
A. Authentication Down/Switching Down
B. Authentication-Central/Switch-Local
C. Authentication-Down/Switch-Local
D. Authentication-Central/Switch-Central
  
Answer: C
 
Explanation
 A FlexConnect WLAN, depending on its configuration and network connectivity, is classified as being in one of the following defined states.
 + Authentication-Central/Switch-Central: This state represents a WLAN that uses a centralized authentication method such as 802.1X, VPN, or web. User traffic is sent to the WLC via CAPWAP (Central switching). This state is supported only when FlexConnect is in connected mode.
 + Authentication Down/Switching Down: Central switched WLANs no longer beacon or respond to probe requests when the FlexConnect AP is in standalone mode. Existing clients are disassociated.
 + Authentication-Central/Switch-Local: This state represents a WLAN that uses centralized authentication, but user traffic is switched locally. This state is supported only when the FlexConnect AP is in connected mode.
 + Authentication-Down/Switch-Local: A WLAN that requires central authentication rejects new users. Existing authenticated users continue to be switched locally until session time-out if configured. The WLAN continues to beacon  and respond to probes until there are no more existing users associated to the WLAN. This state occurs as a result of the AP going into standalone mode.
 + Authentication-local/switch-local: This state represents a WLAN that uses open, static WEP, shared, or WPA2 PSK security methods. User traffic is switched locally. These are the only security methods supported locally if a FlexConnect goes into standalone mode. The WLAN continues to beacon and respond to probes. Existing users remain connected and new user associations are accepted. If the AP is in connected mode, authentication information for these security types is forwarded to the WLC.

Which feature is used to propagate ARP broadcast, and link-local frames across a Cisco SD-Access fabric to address connectivity needs for silent hosts that require reception of traffic to start communicating?
A. Native Fabric Multicast
B. Layer 2 Flooding
C. SOA Transit
D. Multisite Fabric
  
Answer: B
 
Explanation
 Cisco SD-Access fabric provides many optimizations to improve unicast traffic flow, and to reduce the unnecessary flooding of data such as broadcasts. But, for some traffic and applications, it may be desirable to enable broadcast forwarding within the fabric.
 By default, this is disabled in the Cisco SD-Access architecture. If broadcast, Link local multicast and Arp flooding is required, it must be specifically enabled on a per-subnet basis using Layer 2 flooding feature.
 Layer 2 flooding can be used to forward broadcasts for certain traffic and application types which may require leveraging of Layer 2 connectivity, such as silent hosts, card readers, door locks, etc.

 R2(config-if)#ip ospf network broadcast
 R2(config-if)#ip ospf 100 area 0
  
C. R2(config)#interface Loopback0
 R2(config-if)#ip address 172.22.2.1 255.255.255.0
 R2(config-if)#ip ospf network point-to-multipoint
 R2(config-if)#router ospf 100
 R2(config-router)#network 172.22.2.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
 
D. R2(config)#interface Loopback0
 R2(config-if)#ip address 172.22.2.1 255.255.255.0
 R2(config-if)#ip ospf network point-to-point
 R2(config-if)#ip ospf 100 area 0
  
Answer: D
 
Explanation
 Although the configured loopback address is 172.22.2.1/24 but by default OSPF will advertise this route to loopback0 as 172.22.2.1/32 (most specific route to that loopback). In order to override this, we have to change the network type to point-to-point. After this OSPF will advertise the address to loopback as 172.22.2.0/24.

How do stratum levels relate to the distance from a time source?
A. Stratum 1 devices are connected directly to an authoritative time source
B. Stratum 15 devices are an authoritative time source
C. Stratum 0 devices are connected directly to an authoritative time source
D. Stratum 15 devices are connected directly to an authoritative time source
  
Answer: A
 
Explanation
 NTP uses the concept of a stratum to describe how many hops (routers) away a machine is from an authoritative time source, usually a reference clock. A reference clock is a stratum 0 device that is assumed to be accurate and has little or no delay associated with it. Stratum 0 servers cannot be used on the network but they are directly connected to computers which then operate as stratum-1 servers. A stratum 1 time server acts as a primary network time standard.

Which LISP component decapsulates messages and forwards them to the map server responsible for the egress tunnel routers?
A. Map Resolver
B. Router Locator
C. Proxy ETR
D. Ingress Tunnel Router
  
Answer: A
 
Explanation
 The function of the LISP Map Resolver (MR) is to accept encapsulated Map-Request messages from ingress tunnel routers (ITRs), decapsulate those messages, and then forward the messages to the MS responsible for the egress  tunnel routers (ETRs) that are authoritative for the requested EIDs.
  Reference: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/iproute_lisp/configuration/15-mt/irl-15-mt-book/irl-
  overview.pdf
  In the example below, R3 works as a Map-resolver (MR) to receive and process the EID-to-RLOC mapping lookup queries and provides the mappings to requester.

   MS & MR functions are often included in a single device, which is referred to as an MR/MS device. If MS and MR are two separate devices, MR is responsible to forward the Map-Request messages to the correct MS.

Question 63
Which action occurs during a Layer 3 roam?
A. Client receives a new ip address after getting authenticated
B. The client is marked as “Foreign” on the original controller
C. Client database entry is moved from the old controller to the new controller
D. Client traffic is tunneled back to the original controller after a Layer 3 roam occurs
  
Answer: D
 
Explanation
In instances where the client roams between APs that are connected to different WLCs and the WLC WLAN is connected to a different subnet, a Layer 3 roam is performed, and there is an update between the new WLC (foreign WLC) and the old WLC (anchor WLC) mobility databases.
 If this is the case, return traffic to the client still goes through its originating anchor WLC. The anchor WLC uses Ethernet over IP (EoIP) to forward the client traffic to the foreign WLC, to where the client has roamed. Traffic from the  roaming client is forwarded out the foreign WLC interface on which it resides; it is not tunneled back. (-> Answer D is not correct). But this is contradict to what is said in the Official Cert Guide book:
 “A Layer 3 intercontroller roam consists of an extra tunnel that is built between the client’s original controller and the controller it has roamed to. The tunnel carries data to and from the client as if it is still associated with the original controller and IP subnet.”

 The client begins with a connection to AP B on WLC 1. This creates an ANCHOR entry in the WLC client database. As the client moves away from AP B and makes an association with AP C, WLC 2 sends a mobility announcement to peers in the mobility group looking for the WLC with the client MAC address. WLC 1 responds to the announcement, handshakes, and ACKs. Next the client database entry for the roaming client is copied to WLC 2, and marked as FOREIGN. Included PMK data (master key data from the RADIUS server) is also copied to WLC 2. This provides fast roam times for WPA2/802.11i clients because there is no need to re-authenticate to the RADIUS server.
 After a simple key exchange between the client and AP, the client is added to the WLC 2 database and is similar, except that it is marked as FOREIGN.
 Reference: https://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/solutions/Enterprise/Mobility/emob30dg/TechArch.html
  In Layer 3 roaming, no IP address refresh needed (although client must be re-authenticated and new security session
 established) -> Answer A is not correct.
 In summary, the “Mobility State” of a client is described below:
 + Before roaming: Mobility State = Local
 + After roaming: Mobility State on Old Database = Anchor; Mobility State on New Database = Foreign
 Therefore the client entry on the original controller is not passed to the database totally. The client entry is still on the
 old controller but it is marked “Anchor” (not “Foreign”) -> Answer B is not correct.
 Answer C is not correct as the “Client database entry is not moved, but copied to the new controller.
 -> Therefore the best choice should be answerD.

A system must validate access rights to all its resources and must not rely on a cached permission matrix. If the access level to a given resource is revoked but is not reflected in the permission matrix, the security is violated. Which term refers to this REST security design principle?
A. least common mechanism
B. separation of privilege
C. Economy mechanism
D. Complete mediation
  
Answer: D
 
Explanation
 The principle of complete mediation requires that all accesses to objects be checked to ensure that they are allowed. Whenever a subject attempts to read an object, the operating system should mediate the action. First, it determines if the subject is allowed to read the object. If so, it provides the resources for the read to occur. If the subject tries to read the object again, the system should check that the subject is still allowed to read the object. Most systems would not make the second check. They would cache the results of the first check and base the second access on the cached results.

Which configuration enables a Cisco router to send information to a TACACS+ server for individual EXEC commands associated with privilege level 15?
A. Router(config)# aaa accounting exec default start-stop group tacacs+
B. Router(config)# aaa authorization exec default group tacacs+
C. Router(config)# aaa accounting commands 15 default start-stop group tacacs+
D. Router(config)# aaa authorization commands 15 default group tacacs+
  
Answer: C
 
Explanation
 Authorization–Provides fine-grained control over user capabilities for the duration of the user’s session, including but not limited to setting autocommands, access control, session duration, or protocol support. You can also enforce restrictions on what commands a user may execute with the TACACS+ authorization feature.
 Accounting–Collects and sends information used for billing, auditing, and reporting to the TACACS+ daemon. Network managers can use the accounting facility to track user activity for a security audit or to provide information for user billing. Accounting records include user identities, start and stop times, executed commands (such as PPP), number of packets, and number of bytes.

An engineer must configure the wireless endpoints to authenticate using Active Directory credentials in an encrypted tunnel in addition to using a hashed password. Which action is required?
A. Configure PEAP with GTC
B. Configure EAP-TLS with MSCHAP v2
C. Configure PEAP with MSCHAP v2
D. Configure EAP-TLS with GTC
  
Answer: C
 
Explanation
 EAP-Transport Layer Security (EAP-TLS) requires an exchange of proof of identities through public key cryptography (such as digital certificates). EAP-TLS secures this exchange with an encrypted TLS tunnel, which helps to resist  dictionary or other attacks.
 EAP-PEAP is a protocol that creates an encrypted (and more secure) channel before the password-based authentication occurs. The PEAP authentication creates an encrypted SSL/TLS tunnel between client and authentication server.
  -> Therefore both PEAP and EAP-TLS can be used to create an encrypted tunnel so both of them are correct.
 Generic Token Card (GTC) enables the exchange of clear-text authentication credentials across the network ->
 Answers with “GTC” are not correct.
 Reference: https://www.arubanetworks.com/techdocs/ClearPass/6.9/PolicyManager/Content/CPPM_UserGuide/Auth/Au
  thMethod_eap-gtc.htm
  If you use EAP-MSCHAPv2, it means that your clients doesn’t need to have a certificate, but your authentication server (NPS) has a certificate. Passwords from the clients are send using hashes to the authentication server.
  You can use PEAP-EAP-MSCHAPv2 which use a certificate on the authentication server (NPS) and a  password for clients. (-> Therefore answer C is correct). You can use PEAP-EAP-TLS which use a certificate on the
  authentication server and a certificate on the client.

An engineer must design a wireless network to primarily support 5-GHz clients. The clients do not support the UNII-2c portion of the 5-GHz band. Due to application bandwidth requirements, the engineer uses 40-MHz channels. Which design consideration must be made in this scenario?
A. There are 12 overlapping channels available.
B. There are four non overlapping channel available.
C. There are 25 overlapping channels available.
D. There are six non-overlapping channels available.
  
Answer: B
 
Explanation
 5 Ghz offers significantly more bandwidth than 2.4 GHz. All of the 5 GHz channels offered support at least 20MHz channel width without overlap.
 When using 5 GHz, it is recommended to use at least 40 MHz channel width, as some client devices may not prefer 5 GHz unless it offers a greater channel width than 2.4 GHz.
 If using 40 MHz channel width, the bandwidth of the following channel is used:
 36 – 40
 44 – 48
 149 – 153
 157 – 161
 Note: There are 6 non-overlapping channels but 2 channels are reserved for DFS.
 “However, due to the coexistence of both radar and Wi-Fi networks in the same area of spectrum, the Wi-Fi standard (IEEE 802.11) was designed to incorporate a spectrum sharing mechanism on 5GHz to ensure that Wi-Fi networks do not operate on frequencies (hence causing interference) that are used by nearby radar stations. This mechanism is
 known as Dynamic Frequency Selection (DFS) and is designed to mitigate interference to 5GHz radar by WLANs.”

	Origin IGP, localpref 100, valid, external, best
  
After configuring the BGP network, an engineer verifies that the path between Server1 and Server2 is functional. Why did RouterSF choose the route from RouterDAL instead of the route from RouterCHI?
A. The Router-ID for Router DAL is lower than the Router-ID for RouterCHI.
B. The route from RouterDAL has a lower MED.
C. BGP is not running on RouterCHI.
D. There is a static route in RouterSF for 10.0.0.0/24.
  
Answer: A
 
Explanation
 From the output of “show bgp 10.0.0.0” command, we see that two paths have the same localpref 100, same AS path length, same Origin IGP. We don’t have information about the Weight so we can guess the Router ID is used to choose the BGP best path.
 Note: BGP Path Selection Attributes: (highest) Weight > (highest) Local Preference > Originate > (shortest) AS Path > Origin > (lowest) MED > External > IGP Cost > eBGP Peering > (lowest) Router ID

What is a characteristic of a Type 1 hypervisor?
A. It is installed on an operating system and supports other operating systems above it.
B. It is completely independent of the operating system.
C. Problems in the base operating system can affect the entire system.
D. It is referred to as a hosted hypervisor.
  
Answer: B
 
Explanation
 There are two types of hypervisors: type 1 and type 2 hypervisor.
 In type 1 hypervisor (or native hypervisor), the hypervisor is installed directly on the physical server. Then instances of an operating system (OS) are installed on the hypervisor. Type 1 hypervisor has direct access to the hardware resources. Therefore they are more efficient than hosted architectures. Some examples of type 1 hypervisor are VMware vSphere/ESXi, Oracle VM Server, KVM and Microsoft Hyper-V.
 In contrast to type 1 hypervisor, a type 2 hypervisor (or hosted hypervisor) runs on top of an operating system and not the physical hardware directly. A big advantage of Type 2 hypervisors is that management console software is not required. Examples of type 2 hypervisor are VMware Workstation (which can run on Windows, Mac and Linux) or
 Microsoft Virtual PC (only runs on Windows).

An engineer configures the trunk and proceeds to configure an ESPAN session to monitor VLANs 10, 20, and 30. Which command must be added to complete this configuration?
A. Device(config-mon-erspan-src-dst)# mtu 1460

C. Device(config-mon-erspan-src-dst)# erspan id 6
D. Device(config-mon-erspan-src)# no filter vlan 30
  
Answer: D
 
Explanation
 The command “filter vlan 30” limits to monitor only VLAN 30 so we will not see any traffic for VLAN 10 and 20.
 Therefore we must remove this command.

How should the script be completed so that each device configuration is saved into a JSON-formatted file under the device name?
A. Append to the body of the for loop:
 with open(f”{Hostname}.json”, “w”) as OutFile:
 OutFile.write(Response.text)
B. Insert after the for loop:
 with open(f”{Hostname}.json”, “w”) as OutFile:
 OutFile.write(json.dumps(Response.text))
C. Insert after the for loop:
 with open(f”{Hostname}.json”, “w”) as OutFile:
 OutFile.write(Response)
D. Insert immediately before the for loop:
 with open(f”{Hostname}.json”, “w”) as OutFile:
 OutFile.write(json.load(Devices))
  
Answer: A
 
Explanation
 We need to write the Response in the for loop because the Response would change for every element of the loop.
 “Insert after the for loop” in Python means the for loop ends before our code is executed.

D. action 1.0 cli command “enable”
 action 2.0 cli command “file prompt quiet”
 action 3.0 cli command copy running-config bootflash:/current_config.txt
 action 4.0 cli command “no file prompt quiet”
 action 5.0 syslog priority critical msg “Configuration saved and copied to bootflash”
  
Answer: A
 
Explanation
 When we use the “copy” command , the device asks many parameters although we provided it in the command. For example:
     Router#copy system:running-config tftp://10.0.0.2/fw-test Source filename [running-config]?
Address or name of remote host [10.0.0.2]?
Destination filename [fw-test]?
!!
2009 bytes copied in 0.604 secs (3326 bytes/sec)
   Therefore we can disable the annoying questions with the file prompt quiet configuration command. This command is under global configuration mode:
  Therefore we must enter the “configure terminal” command first.

What is a characteristics of a vSwitch?
A. enables VMs to communicate with each other within a virtualized server
B. supports advanced Layer 3 routing protocols that are not offered by a hardware switch
C. has higher performance than a hardware switch
D. operates as a hub and broadcasts the traffic toward all the vPorts

Answer: A
 
Explanation
 Hypervisors provide virtual switch (vSwitch) that Virtual Machines (VMs) use to communicate with other VMs on the same host. The vSwitch may also be connected to the host’s physical NIC to allow VMs to get layer 2 access to the outside world.
 Each VM is provided with a virtual NIC (vNIC) that is connected to the virtual switch. Multiple vNICs can connect to a single vSwitch, allowing VMs on a physical host to communicate with one another at layer 2 without having to go out to
 a physical switch.
    Although vSwitch does not run Spanning-tree protocol but vSwitch implements other loop prevention mechanisms. For example, a frame that enters from one VMNIC is not going to go out of the physical host from a different VMNIC card.

Which option works with a DHCP server to return at least one WLAN management interface IP address during the discovery phase and is dependent upon the VCI of the AP?
A. Option 43
B. Option 42
C. Option 125
D. Option 15

Answer: A
 
Explanation
 The DHCP client sends option code 60 in a DHCPREQUEST to the DHCP server. When the server receives option 60, it sees the VCI, finds the matching VCI in its own table, and then it returns option 43 with the value (that corresponds to the VCI), thereby relaying vendor-specific information to the correct client. Both the client and server have knowledge of the VCI.
 Reference: https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/9-0/pan-os-admin/networking/dhcp/dhcp-options/dhcp-options-
  43-55-and-60-and-other-customized-options
  The AP boots up, performs POST, and then sends a DHCP request. The switch should send out a DHCP offer, an IP address to use, a default gateway to use, and also the option 43 TLV . The TLV should contain the IP address of the WLC, with which the AP needs to be associated.

What is a characteristics of traffic policing?
A. lacks support for marking or remarking
B. can be applied in both traffic directions
C. must be applied only to outgoing traffic
D. queues out-of-profile packets until the buffer is full
  
Answer: B
 
Explanation
 Policing: is used to control the rate of traffic flowing across an interface. During a bandwidth exceed (crossed the maximum configured rate), the excess traffic is generally dropped or remarked. The result of traffic policing is an output rate that appears as a saw-tooth with crests and troughs. Traffic policing can be applied to inbound and outbound interfaces. Unlike traffic shaping, QoS policing avoids delays due to queuing. Policing is configured in bytes.

 The purpose of this question is when someone tries to access the IP 10.10.110.10, the IP addresses from 10.0.0.2 to 10.0.0.9 will be handed out in a rotary fashion. This performs a basic form of load balancing. In order to do this, we need “type rotary” in the “ip nat pool ...” statement -> Answer C is correct.
 Also Gi0/0 interface must be the NAT inside interface -> Answer A is correct.
 
Question 103 - Checked
A large campus network has deployed two wireless LAN controllers to manage the wireless network. WLC1 and WLC2 have been configured as mobility peers. A client device roams from AP1 on WLC1 to AP2 on WLC2, but the controller’s client interfaces are on different VLANs. How do the wireless LAN controllers handle the inter-subnet roaming?
A. WLC2 marks the client with a foreign entry in its own database. The database entry is copied to the new controller and marked with an anchor entry on WLC1
B. WLC2 marks the client with an anchor entry in its own database. The database entry is copied to the new controller and marked with a foreign entry on WLC1
C. WLC1 marks the client with a foreign entry in its own database. The database entry is copied to the new controller and marked with an anchor entry on WLC2
D. WLC1 marks the client with an anchor entry in its own database. The database entry is copied to the new controller and marked with a foreign entry on WLC2
  
Answer: D

Explanation
 In instances where the client roams between APs that are connected to different WLCs and the WLC WLAN is connected to a different subnet, a Layer 3 roam is performed, and there is an update between the new WLC (foreign WLC) and the old WLC (anchor WLC) mobility databases.
 If this is the case, return traffic to the client still goes through its originating anchor WLC. The anchor WLC uses Ethernet over IP (EoIP) to forward the client traffic to the foreign WLC, to where the client has roamed. Traffic from the roaming client is forwarded out the foreign WLC interface on which it resides; it is not tunneled back.

 The client begins with a connection to AP B on WLC 1. This creates an ANCHOR entry in the WLC client database. As the client moves away from AP B and makes an association with AP C, WLC 2 sends a mobility announcement to peers in the mobility group looking for the WLC with the client MAC address. WLC 1 responds to the announcement, handshakes, and ACKs. Next the client database entry for the roaming client is copied to WLC 2, and marked as FOREIGN. Included PMK data (master key data from the RADIUS server) is also copied to WLC 2. This provides fast roam times for WPA2/802.11i clients because there is no need to re-authenticate to the RADIUS server.
 After a simple key exchange between the client and AP, the client is added to the WLC 2 database and is similar, except that it is marked as FOREIGN.

An administrator troubleshoots intermittent connectivity from internal hosts to an external public server. Some internal hosts can connect to the server while others receive an ICMP Host Unreachable message and these hosts change over time. What is the cause of this issue?
A. The translator does not use address overloading
B. The NAT pool netmask is excessively wide
C. The NAT ACL and NAT pool share the same name
D. The NAT ACL does not match all internal hosts
  
Answer: A
 
Explanation
 As we can see there is the line “type generic, total addresses 2, allocated 2(100%), missed 7”. This means all the IP addresses for NAT have been allocated and 7 requests were missed. It means this is NAT 1:1, not PAT so answer A is correct.
 Answer D is not correct as the NAT ACL covers internal hosts 10.0.3.1 but it still failed to allocated address so we cannot say it does not match all internal hosts.

interface Gig0/1
switchport trunk encap dot1q
switchport mode trunk

The port channel between the switches does not work as expected. Which action resolves the issue?
A. Interface Gi0/0 on Switch2 must be configured as passive.
B. Interface Gi0/1 on Switch1 must be configured as desirable.
C. Interface Gi0/1 on Switch2 must be configured as active.
D. Trunking must be enabled on both interfaces on Switch2.
  
Answer: C
 
Explanation
 With above configuration, the Port-channel 1 of Switch1 is in trunking mode “on”:
   We try changing the Etherchannel mode of Gi0/1 on Switch2 to “active” and it worked.
  This is because one side is mode “On” while the other side is mode “active”.

A network engineer must configure NETCONF. After creating the configuration, the engineer gets output from the command show line, but not from show running-config. Which command completes the configuration?
A. Device(config)# no netconf ssh acl 1
B. Device(config)# netconf max-sessions 100
C. Device(config)# netconf lock-time 500
D. Device(config)# netconf max-message 1000
  
Answer: D
 
Explanation
 If we use the “no netconf ssh acl 1” then the whole NETCONF function will be disabled so the best answer should be “netconf max-message 1000” as it will increase the maximum size of messages received in a NETCONF session to 1000KB (~1MB).

 Note:
 + The valid range for the netconf lock-time seconds is 1 to 300 so 500 is not a valid value.
 + The valid range for the netconf max-sessions number is 4 to 16 so 100 is not a valid value.

Answer: A
 
Explanation
 This EEM script is only used when OSPF neighborship goes down so the OSPF must be “from FULL to DOWN”, not “from LOADING to FULL” so Option B and Option D are not correct. Also the SEVERITY level of Syslog message of this event is 5 (notification) so it must be “%OSPF-5-ADJCHG”, not “%OSPF-1-ADJCHG” -> Only Option A is correct.

A network engineer is adding an additional 10Gbps link to an exiting 2x10Gbps LACP-based LAG to augment its capacity. Network standards require a bundle interface to be taken out of service if one of its member links goes down, and the new link must be added with minimal impact to the production network. Which does the engineer do first?
A. Execute the channel-group number mode active command to add the 10Gbps link to the existing bundle
B. Validate the network layer of the 10Gbps link
C. Validate the physical and data link layers of the 10Gbps link
D. Execute the lacp min-bundle 3 command to set the minimum of ports threshold

Answer: C

 “Network standards require a bundle interface to be taken out of service if one of its member links goes down” -> Use the lacp min-bundle command to configure the minimum number of active links allowed in an LACP bundle. When the number of active links falls below this minimum threshold, the port channel shuts down.

  This question did not tell us which router we are configuring so we suppose we are configuring Client router (which is more reasonable). Therefore in the first box we have to enter the BGP AS number (same as “router bgp {as-number}” command).
 In the second and third box we have to configure BGP neighbor information (same as “neighbor {neighbor-IP-address}
 remote-as {remote-as}” command).
 In the last box we have to configure under “address-family ipv4” mode so we need to type the neighbor IP address once more.
 Note: The first box is the BGP id, which means the BGP AS Number, not the router-id so we have to use 65001, not 192.168.1.2. You can see the difference in the figure below:

C. AP(config-if-ssid)# authentication dynamic open wep_dynamic

Answer: D
 
Explanation
 When your SSID authentication mechanism uses Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) with 802.1x  authentication (and without WPA v1 or WPA v2 support), dynamic WEP keys can be generated for each wireless user.
  Dynamic WEP keys are more secure than static, or unchanging, WEP keys. If an intruder passively receives enough packets encrypted by the same WEP key, the intruder can perform a calculation to learn the key and use it to join your network. Because they change frequently, dynamic WEP keys prevent intruders from performing the calculation and learning the key.

Which threat defense mechanism, when deployed at the network perimeter, protects against zero-day attacks?
A. intrusion prevention
B. stateful inspection
C. sandbox
D. SSL decryption
  
Answer: A
 
Explanation
 A zero-day (or 0-day) vulnerability is a software vulnerability that is discovered by attackers before the vendor has become aware of it. By definition, no patch exists for zero-day vulnerabilities and user systems have no defenses in place, making attacks highly likely to succeed. The name “zero-day” is designed to imply how long since the
 vulnerability was discovered. The term also indicates that system developers have had zero days to fix it.
 Intrusion Protection
 While the precise methods of a zero-day exploit can’t be known in advance, a network intrusion protection system (NIPS) can monitor the firms’ network for unusual activity.
 The advantage of NIPS over a traditional antivirus only system is it does not rely on checking software against a known database of threats. This means it does not need updates or patches to learn about the latest attacks. NIPS works by monitoring the day-to-day patterns of network activity across the network.
 When traffic or events far out of the ordinary are detected action can be taken to alert system administrators and lock down the firewall. Devices such as USB drives and mobile devices can all introduce threats to the network. They can often make it past the firewall because they are physically introduced to the system.
 NIPS protects against threats introduced to the network from both external and internal sources.

  IOS XR actions are RPC statements that trigger an operation or execute a command on the router. Theses actions are defined as YANG models using RPC statements. An action is executed when the router receives the corresponding NETCONF RPC request. Once the router executes an action, it replies with a NETCONF RPC response.

What is required for intercontroller Layer 3 roaming?
A. Mobility groups are established between wireless controllers.
B. WLCs have the same IP addresses configured on their interfaces.
C. WLCs use separate DHCP servers.
D. The management VLAN is present as a dynamic VLAN on the second WLC.
  
Answer: A
 
Explanation
 If the management VLAN of one controller is present as a dynamic VLAN on another controller, the mobility feature is not supported -> Answer D is not correct.
 Cisco Wireless Controllers (that are mobility peers) must use the same DHCP server to have an updated client mobility move count on intra-VLAN -> Answer C is not correct.
 The figure below shows intercontroller Layer 3 roaming, which occurs when the wireless LAN interfaces of the controllers are on different IP subnets... -> Answer B is not correct.

Which technology uses network traffic telemetry, contextual information, and file reputation to provide insight into cyber threats?
A. threat defense
B. security services
C. security intelligence
D. segmentation
  
Answer: A
 
Explanation
 According to the CCNP and CCIE Enterprise Core ENCOR 350-401 Official Cert Guide Book in Chapter 25: Secure Network Access Control:
 Threat defense: It is important to have visibility into the most dangerous cyber threats. Threat defense provides this visibility through network traffic telemetry, file reputation, and contextual information (such as device types, locations, users, identities, roles, privileges levels, login status, posture status, and so on). It enables assessment of the nature and the potential risk of suspicious activity so that the correct next steps for cyber threats can be taken.
 Note:
 Security intelligence: Security intelligence provides detection of emerging malware and cyber threats. It enables an infrastructure to enforce policy dynamically, as reputations are augmented by the context of new threats. This enables accurate and timely security protection.
 
Question 19 - Checked
An engineer must configure AAA on a Cisco 9800 WLC for central web authentication. Which two commands are needed to accomplish this task? (Choose two)
A. (Cisco Controller)> config radius acct add 10.10.10.12 1812 SECRET
B. (Cisco Controller)> config wlan aaa-override enable <wlan-id>
C. (Cisco Controller)> config wlan aaa-override disable <wlan-id>
D. Device(config-locsvr-da-radius)#client 10.10.10.12 server-key 0 SECRET
E. Device(config)# aaa server radius dynamic-author
  
Answer: DE
 
Explanation
 Answer B and answer C are used to enable/disable AAA Override option but it is just optional so they are not the correct answers. AAA Override enables you to apply VLAN tagging, Quality of Service, and Access Control Lists to individual clients based on the returned RADIUS attributes from the AAA server.
 According to this Cisco link (under AAA Configuration on 9800 WLCs) section, we need the following commands:
      # aaa new-model
# radius server <radius-server-name>
# address ipv4 <radius-server-ip> auth-port 1812 acct-port 1813 # timeout 300
# retransmit 3
# key <shared-key>
# exit
# aaa group server radius <radius-grp-name> # server name <radius-server-name>
# exit
# aaa server radius dynamic-author
# client <radius-server-ip> server-key <shared-key>
# aaa authentication dot1x <dot1x-list-name> group <radius-grp-name>
   Therefore answer D and answer E are correct.

QOS - Silver (BE)
App Visibility - Off
AVC Profile - none
Netflow Monitor - none
Fastlane - Disable
WMM Policy - Allowed
  
An engineer is troubleshooting an application running on Apple phones. The application is receiving incorrect QoS markings. The systems administrator confirmed that all configuration profiles are correct on the Apple devices. Which change on the WLC optimizes QoS for these devices?
A. Enable Fastlane
B. Set WMM to required
C. Change the QoS level to Platinum
D. Configure AVC Profiles
  
Answer: A

Explanation
 Apple iOS device mark QoS as per IETF recommendations. With WLC running AireOS8.3, you can enable the Fastlane feature, which enables several beneficial functions:
 – Your WLC QoS configuration is optimized globally to better support real-time applications
  – iOS 10 devices can send upstream voice traffic without the requirement to perform WMM TSPEC/TCLAS negotiation. The infrastructure will honor the voice marking for these devices.
  – You can apply a QoS profile to your iOS 10 devices, and decide which applications should receive QoS marking upstream, and which applications should be sent as best effort or background.

What are two benefits of implementing a Cisco SD-WAN architecture? (Choose two)
A. It provides resilient and effective traffic flow using MPLS
B. It improves endpoint protection by integrating embedded and cloud security features
C. It allows configuration of application-aware policies with real time enforcement
D. It simplifies endpoint provisioning through standalone router management
E. It enforces a single, scalable, hub-and-spoke topology
  
Answer: CD
 
Explanation
 The top SD-WAN benefits are:
 + Increased bandwidth at a lower cost
 + Centralized management across branch networks
  + Full visibility into the network
 + Providing organizations with more connection type options and vendor selection when building a network.
 Reference: https://www.sdxcentral.com/networking/sd-wan/definitions/sd-wan-technology/
  -> We can provision endpoints (vEdges) through a centralized router vManage -> Answer D is correct.
 Answer A is not correct as we can use different kind of connections on SD-WAN: MPLS, LTE, 4G, xDSL, Internet connections...
 Application-Aware Routing policy is configured in vManage as a centralized data policy that maps the service-side application(s) to specific SLA requirements. The centralized policies provisioned in vSmart controller is pushed to relevant WAN Edge devices for enforcement. The defined policy consists of match-action pairs, where the match statement defines the application-list or the type of traffic to match, and the action statement defines the SLA action the WAN Edge devices must enforce for the specified traffic.
 Reference: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/solutions/CVD/SDWAN/cisco-sdwan-application-aware-routing-
  deploy-guide.html
  -> Therefore answer C is correct.
 Answer E is not correct as it is not a benefit of SD-WAN.
 Answer B is not wrong but it is not the best choice so we don’t choose it.

Which of the following are related to OSPF? (Choose two)
A. The path metric is simple and based on interface cost
B. The path metrics are complex
C. The summary can be interface based
D. The route summary is not interface based

How can an engineer prevent basic replay attacks from people who try to brute force a system via REST API?
A. Use HTTPS
B. Use a password hash
C. Add OAuth to the request in the API header
D. Add a timestamp to the request in the API header
  
Answer: D
 
Explanation
 Consider Adding Timestamp in Request
 Along with other request parameters, you may add a request timestamp as an HTTP custom header in API requests.
 The server will compare the current timestamp to the request timestamp and only accepts the request if it is after a reasonable timeframe (30 seconds, perhaps).
 This will prevent very basic replay attacks from people who are trying to brute force your system without changing this timestamp.

If a client’s radio device receives a signal strength of -67 dBm and the noise floor is -85 dBm, what is the SNR value?
A. 15 dB
B. 16 dB
C. 18 dB
D. 20 dB
  
Answer: C
 
Explanation
 If your SNR measurements are already in decibel form, then you can subtract the noise quantity from the desired signal: SNR = S – N. This is because when you subtract logarithms, it is the equivalent of dividing normal numbers.
 Also, the difference in the numbers equals the SNR. In this question, SNR = -67 – (-85) = 18.

What is one primary REST security design principle?
A. password hash
B. fail-safe defaults
C. adding a timestamp in requests
D. OAuth
  
Answer: B
 
Explanation
 The paper “The Protection of Information in Computer Systems” by Jerome Saltzer and Michael Schroeder, put forth eight design principles for securing information in computer systems, as described in the following sections:
 + Least Privilege: An entity should only have the required set of permissions to perform the actions for which they are authorized, and no more. Permissions can be added as needed and should be revoked when no longer in use.
 + Fail-Safe Defaults: A user’s default access level to any resource in the system should be “denied” unless they’ve been granted a “permit” explicitly.
 + The economy of Mechanism: The design should be as simple as possible. All the component interfaces and the interactions between them should be simple enough to understand.
 + Complete Mediation: A system should validate access rights to all its resources to ensure that they’re allowed and should not rely on the cached permission matrix. If the access level to a given resource is being revoked, but that isn’t reflected in the permission matrix, it would violate the security.
 + Open Design: This principle highlights the importance of building a system in an open manner—with no secret, confidential algorithms.
 + Separation of Privilege: Granting permissions to an entity should not be purely based on a single condition, a combination of conditions based on the type of resource is a better idea.
 + Least Common Mechanism: It concerns the risk of sharing state among different components. If one can corrupt the shared state, it can then corrupt all the other components that depend on it.
 + Psychological Acceptability: It states that security mechanisms should not make the resource more difficult to access than if the security mechanisms were not present. In short, security should not make worse the user experience.

Question 48
A network engineer configures a WLAN controller with increased security for web access. There is IP connectivity with the WLAN controller, but the engineer cannot start a management session from a web browser. Which action resolves the issue?
A. Use a private or incognito session.
B. Disable Adobe Flash Player
C. Disable JavaScript on the web browser
D. Use a browser that supports 128-bit or larger ciphers.
  
Answer: D
 
Explanation
 Enable or disable secure web mode with increased security by entering this command:
 config network secureweb cipher-option high {enable | disable}
 This command allows users to access the controller GUI using “https://ip-address” but only from browsers that support 128-bit (or larger) ciphers. With Release 8.10, this command is, by default, in enabled state.
  When high ciphers is enabled, SHA1, SHA256, SHA384 keys continue to be listed and TLSv1.0 is disabled. This is applicable to webauth and webadmin but not for NMSP.

C. Enable fast LACP PDUs on interface Gi0/0
D. Configure channel-group 1 mode active on interface Gi0/0
  
Answer: A
 
Explanation
 Interface Gi0/0 is in hot standby state. Therefore, the LACP parameters have been met and the max bundle links has been reached. Therefore we have to increase the max bundle links to 2.
 
Question 54
A network engineer is enabling HTTPS access to the core switch, which requires a certificate to be installed on the switch signed by the corporate certificate authority. Which configuration commands are required to issue a certificate
 signing request from the core switch?
A. Core-Switch(config)#crypto pki trustpoint Core-Switch
 Core-Switch(ca-trustpoint)#enrollment terminal
 Core-Switch(config)#crypto pki enroll Core-Switch
B. Core-Switch(config)#crypto pki enroll Core-Switch
 Core-Switch(config)#ip http secure-trustpoint Core-Switch
C. Core-Switch(config)#ip http secure-trustpoint Core-Switch
 Core-Switch(config)#crypto pki enroll Core-Switch
D. Core-Switch(config)#crypto pki trustpoint Core-Switch
 Core-Switch(ca-trustpoint)#enrollment terminal
 Core-Switch(config)#ip http secure-trustpoint Core-Switch
  
Answer: A
 
Explanation
 Certificate authorities (CAs) are responsible for managing certificate requests and issuing certificates to participating IPSec network devices. These services provide centralized security key and certificate management for the participating devices. Specific CA servers are referred to as “trustpoints.”
 The command “crypto pki trustpoint name” declares the trustpoint and a given name and enters ca-trustpoint configuration mode.
 The command “enrollment terminal” specifies manual cut-and-paste certificate enrollment method. The certificate request will be displayed on the console terminal so that you may manually copied (or cut).

 The command “crypto pki enroll name” generates certificate request and displays the request for copying and pasting into the certificate server.
 The full configuration is shown in the reference below.

Area 1
	R1 and R6
Area 2
	R9
Area 3
	R2

An engineer must prevent the R6 loopback from getting into Area 2 and Area 3 from Area 0. Which action must the engineer take?
A. Apply a fitter list inbound on R2 and R9
B. Apply a filter list outbound on R3 and R7
C. Apply a filter list outbound on R7 only
D. Apply a filter list inbound on R3 and R7
  
Answer: D
 
Explanation
 In this topology, R3 and R7 are in fact the ABRs. If we apply an area filtering inbound direction (with the “area area-number filter-list prefix ... in” commands) on R3 and R7 then the ABRs will filter prefixes that enter this area. For example, on R7 we use the command “area 2 filter-list prefix Deny_Lo_R6 in” command then the Lo interface of R6 will not be advertised into area 2.
 Note: The “area area-number filter-list prefix ... out” (out direction) will prevent prefixes from advertising outside of this area although the ABR still learns about these prefixes.
 In particular, the following commands will prevent R6 loopback from getting into Area 3 on R3 (of course we have to configure the same thing on R7):
   R3(config)#ip prefix-list PREVENT_R1_LO deny 1.1.1.1/32 R3(config)#ip prefix-list PREVENT_R1_LO permit 0.0.0.0/0 le 32
  
   R3(config)#router ospf 1
R3(config-router)#area 3 filter-list prefix PREVENT_R1_LO in
   Notice that we applied the filter-list for area 3, not area 0.
 Just for your information, if we want to use an outbound filter-list to prevent R6 loopback from getting into Area 2 & 3,
 we can do it on R3 & R7 for area 1 with the following commands:
     R7(config)#ip prefix-list PREVENT_R6_LO deny 1.1.1.1/32 R7(config)#ip prefix-list PREVENT_R6_LO permit 0.0.0.0/0 le 32 R7(config)#router ospf 1
R7(config-router)#area 1 filter-list prefix PREVENT_R6_LO out
   But with these commands, R6 loopback is also not advertised into area 0, which is not satisfied the requirement
 “prevent the R6 loopback from getting into Area 2 and Area 3 from Area 0“.

D. ip nat inside source static tcp 10.1.1.100 80 209.165.200.225 80 no-alias
 ip nat inside source static tcp 10.1.1.100 80 209.165.201.1 80 no-alias
  
Answer: A
 
Explanation
 First let’s check the command “ip nat inside source static tcp 10.1.1.100 80 209.165.200.225 80 extendable”.
 First we will not mention about the effect of the “extendable” keyword. So the purpose of the command “ip nat inside source static tcp 10.1.1.100 80 209.165.200.225 80” is to translate packets on the inside interface (Gi0/1 interface in this case) with a source IP address of 10.1.1.100 and port 80 to the IP address 209.165.200.225 with port 80. This also implies that any packet received on the outside interface with a destination address of 209.165.200.225:80 has the destination translated to 10.1.1.100:80.
 Now we will talk about the keyword “extendable”.
 Usually, the “extendable” keyword should be added if the same Inside Local is mapped to different Inside Global Addresses (the IP address of an inside host as it appears to the outside network). An example of this case is when you have two connections to the Internet on two ISPs for redundancy. So you will need to map two Inside Global IP
 addresses into one inside local IP address. For example:
       NAT router:
ip nat inside source static 192.168.1.1 200.1.1.1 extendable
ip nat inside source static 192.168.1.1 200.2.2.2 extendable //Inside Local: 192.168.1.1 ; Inside Global: 200.1.1.1 & 200.2.2.2
   
Question 58
Based on the router’s API output in JSON format below, which Python code will display the value of the “hostname” key?

{
	"response": [{
		"family": "Switches",
		"macAddress": "jfskdljdfkl",
		"hostname": "sfjlksdjfl"
	}]
}

A. json_data = json.loads(response.text)
 print(json_data[‘response’][‘family’][‘hostname’])
B. json_data = response.json()
 print(json_data[‘response’][0][‘hostname’])
C. json_data = response.json()
 print(json_data[‘response’][family][hostname’])
D. json_data = json.loads(response.text)
 print(json_data[response][0][hostname])
  
Answer: B
 
Explanation
 Note: The json() method of the Response interface takes a Response stream and reads it to completion. It returns a promise which resolves with the result of parsing the body text as JSON.
 In the Python code below, we had to use json.loads() method instead ofresponse.json() to demonstrate because we cannot reproduce the result without a REST API call.
  In practical, we have to call the API like this:
 response = requests.get(“http://{URL_to_get_API}”)
 json_data = response.json()

logging buffered discriminator Disc1 
logging monitor discriminator Disc1
logging host 10.1.55.237 discriminator Disc1
   
A network engineer is enabling logging to a local buffer, to the terminal and to a syslog server for all debugging level logs filtered by facility code 7. Which command is needed to complete this configuration snippet?
A. logging buffered debugging
B. logging discriminator Disc1 severity includes 7
C. logging buffered discriminator Disc1 debugging
D. logging discriminator Disc1 severity includes 7 facility includes fac7
  
Answer: D
 
Explanation
 If your routers/switches send useless but high-level messages to your syslog server, you can use a logging discriminator to eliminate some unwanted log messages.
 The “logging discriminator Disc1 severity includes 7 facility includes fac7” command enables the logging discriminator named Disc1 to filter messages with a severity level of 7 (debugging level) and facility code 7.

A. Option A
B. Option B
C. Option C

Explanation
 There is a typo in the exhibit: R4 should be connected to subnet 172.16.1.0/24 at the right side, not 172.16.10.0/24. Also the same lab can be found at https://community.cisco.com/t5/networking-documents/understanding-bgp-best-
  path-selection-manipulation/ta-p/3150576
  According to this lab, options A B and C are correct. Option B is correct too if we have the command “clear ip bgp 13.13.13.3 soft in”. Therefore it is difficult to say which question should be chosen. But we chose the local preference answer as it is the second significant attribute of BGP.

In a Cisco SD-Access solution, which protocol is used by an extended node to connect to a single edge node?
A. IS-IS
B. 802.1Q
C. VXLAN
D. CTS
  
Answer: B
 
Explanation
 Extended Node
 SD-Access Extended Nodes provide the ability to extend the enterprise network by providing connectivity to non-carpeted spaces of an enterprise – commonly called the Extended Enterprise. This allows network connectivity and management of IoT devices and the deployment of traditional enterprise end devices in outdoor and non-carpeted
 environments such as distribution centers, warehouses, or Campus parking lots.
 This feature extends consistent, policy-based automation to Cisco Industrial Ethernet, Catalyst 3560-CX Compact, and Digital Building Series switches and enables segmentation for user endpoints and IoT devices connected to these nodes. Using Cisco DNA Center automation, switches in the extended node role are onboarded to their connected edge node using an 802.1Q trunk over an EtherChannel with one or multiple physical link members. Extended nodes are discovered using zero-touch Plug-and-Play.

 In a Cisco SD-WAN solution, which two functions are performed by OMP? (Choose two)
A. advertisement of network prefixes and their attributes
B. segmentation and differentiation of traffic
C. gathering of underlay infrastructure data
D. delivery of crypto keys
E. configuration of control and data policies
  
Answer: AD
 
Explanation
 OMP is the control protocol that is used to exchange routing, policy, and management information between Cisco vSmart Controllers and Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices in the overlay network. These devices automatically initiate OMP peering sessions between themselves, and the two IP end points of the OMP session are the system IP addresses of the two devices.
 The OMP protocol is responsible for:
 – Distribution of Transport Locators (TLOCs) among network sites in the sd-wan domain.
 – Distribution of service-side reachability information.
 – Distribution of service-chaining information.
 – Distribution of data plane security parameters, VPN labels, and crypto keys.
  – Distribution of data and application-aware routing (AAR) policies. (Answer E is not correct as OMP is only distribute,
 not configure data policies)

Answer: C
 
Explanation
 Route filtering in OSPF works differently than EIGRP/RIP, etc. The distribute-list and prefix-list in OSPF do not filter
 LSAs that are sent and received between routers.
 ABR can filter LSA type 3. To filter LSA type 3 in OSPF, use the area filter-list command in ABR. By using inbound
 filtering into an area, it does not matter from which area the prefix came, everything that goes into area 1 will hit the
 prefix-list and will be filtered.

By default, which virtual MAC address does HSRP group 16 use?
A. c0:41:43:64:13:10
B. 00:00:0c:07:ac:10
C. 05:00:0c:07:ac:16
D. 00:05:5c:07:0c:16
  
Answer: B
 
Explanation
 HSRP version 1 uses the MAC address range 0000.0C07.ACxx while HSRP version 2 uses the MAC address range
 0000.0C9F.F0xx.
 The last two-digit hex value in the MAC address presents the HSRP group number. In this case 16 in decimal is 10 in hexadecimal. -> Answer B is correct.

Which method is used by an AP to join HA controllers and is configured in NVRAM?
A. Primary/Secondary/Tertiary/Backup
B. DNS
C. IP Helper Addresses
D. stored WLC information
  
Answer: D

Explanation
 To discover a WLC, an AP sends a unicast CAPWAP Discovery Request to a controller’s IP address or a broadcast to the local subnet. If the controller exists and is working, it returns a CAPWAP Discovery Response to the AP. The exact sequence of discovery steps used in Controller Software Release 7.0 is as follows:
 Step 1. Broadcast on the local subnet—The AP will broadcast a CAPWAP
 Discovery Request on its local wired subnet. Any WLCs that also exist on the subnet will answer with a CAPWAP Discovery Response.
 Step 2. Use locally stored WLCs – An AP can be “primed” with up to three controllers – a primary, a secondary, and a tertiary. These are stored in nonvolatile memory so that the AP can remember them after a reboot or power failure.

print("Response Code: " + str(response.status_code))
   
After the code is run on a Cisco IOS-XE router, the response code is 204. What is the result of the script?
A. The configuration fails because another interface is already configured with IP address 10.10.10.1/24.
B. The configuration fails because interface GigabitEthernet2 is missing on the target device.
C. The configuration is successfully sent to the device in cleartext.
D. Interface GigabitEthernet2 is configured with IP address 10.10.10.1/24
  
Answer: D
 
Explanation
 The 204 status code means that the request was received and understood, but that there is no need to send any data back. The server has fulfilled the request but does not need to return an entity-body, and might want to return updated meta information.
 Note: HTTP status code of 2xx means “Success”, which indicates that the client’s request was accepted successfully.

Question 77
An administrator must enable Telnet access to Router X using the router username and password database for authentication. Which configuration should be applied?
A. RouterX(config)#aaa new-model
 RouterX(config)#aaa authentication login auth-list local
B. RouterX(config)#line vty 0 4
 RouterX(config-line)#login
 RouterX(config-line#end
C. RouterX(config)#line aux 0
 RouterX(config-line)#password cisco
 RouterX(config-line#login
D. RouterX(config)#line vty 0 4
 RouterX(config-line)#login local
 RouterX(config-line#end

Answer: D
 
Explanation
 “login” command uses only a password while the “login local” command requires the configuration of a username as well as a password.
 Login local, means that authentication uses locally configured credentials using the
 “username {username} ... password ... “command in global configuration mode.
 -> We configure “login local” to enable Telnet access using username and password in the local database.

 network 172.24.206.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
  
Answer: D
 
Explanation
 By using the correct and exact network and subnet masks, CR1 will not turn on OSPF on new interfaces and it cannot exchange OSPF with other network devices by other interfaces than Gi0/0 & Gi0/1.
 In this question we should understand that these commands make sure CR1 cannot form OSPF neighbor relationship with other routers directly (on a new interface). If it is connected through a switch then surely it can form OSPF neighbor relationship. For example if we add a new router to SW3 in the 10.165.231.0/24 subnet then surely it will create OSPF neighbor relationshipo with CR1.
 Answer “router ospf 1
 network 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255 area 0
 passive-interface GigabitEthernet0/2′′
 is not correct because if CR1 has a new interface then OSPF will also be turned on that interface.
 Answer “interface Gi0/2
 ip ospf 1 area 0

 !
 router ospf 1
 passive-interface GigabitEthernet0/2′′
 is not correct as OSPF is not run on Gi0/1 and CR1 and CR3 cannot exchange OSPF information.

In which two ways does TCAM differ from CAM? (Choose two)
A. CAM is used to make Layer 2 forwarding decisions, and TCAM is used for Layer 3 address lookups.
B. The MAC address table is contained in TCAM, and ACL and QoS information is stored in CAM.
C. CAM is used for software switching mechanisms, and TCAM is used for hardware switching mechanisms.
D. CAM is used by routers for IP address lookups, and TCAM is used to make Layer 2 forwarding decisions.
E. The MAC address table is contained in CAM, and ACL and QoS information is stored in TCAM.
  
Answer: AE
 
Explanation
 When using Ternary Content Addressable Memory (TCAM) inside routers it’s used for faster address lookup that enables fast routing.
 In switches Content Addressable Memory (CAM) is used for building and lookup of mac address table that enables L2 forwarding decisions.

An engineer must export the contents of the devices object in JSON format. Which statement must be use?

import json
from json import dumps, loads

Devices=[{

A. json.print(Devices)
B. json.loads(Devices)
C. json.dumps(Devices)
D. json.repr(Devices)
  
Answer: C
 
Explanation
 json.loads() takes in a string and returns a json object while json.dumps() takes in a json object and returns a string. In this question, “Devices” is a ‘list’, not a string so we have to “dumps” it first to convert it into a string before printing it out.
  Try printing with “loads”:
  Note: JSON does not have attributes “print” or “repr” so we cannot use them.

Packet sent with the DF bit set
MMMMM
0 percent success

An engineer troubleshoots connectivity issues with an application. Testing is performed from the server gateway, and traffic with the DF bit set is dropped along the path after increasing packet size. Removing the DF bit setting at the gateway prevents the packets from being dropped. What is the cause of this issue?
A. PMTUD does not work due to ICMP Packet Too Big messages being dropped by an ACL
B. The remote router drops the traffic due to high CPU load
C. The server should not set the DF bit in any type of traffic that is sent toward the network
D. There is a CoPP policy in place protecting the WAN router CPU from this type of traffic
  
Answer: C
 
Explanation
 If the DF bit is set, routers cannot fragment packets. The ping result of “MMMMM” means “Maximum transmission unit (MTU) problem. Could not fragment.” -> In this case, packet needs to be fragmented but we disabled fragmentation via DF bit.

B. No further action is required. The configuration is complete
C. Add the aaa authentication enable default Administrators command
D. The password expiry mechanism is on the AAA server and must be configured there

A. Set the origin to igp on BR2 toward PE2 inbound
B. Set the local preference to 150 on PE1 toward BR1 outbound
C. Set the weight attribute to 65,535 on BR1 toward PE1
D. Set the MED to 1 on PE2 toward BR2 outbound
  
Answer: D
 
Explanation
 We cannot set the local preference on PE1 because local preference is only sent to iBGP neighbors so this attribute cannot reach BR1 -> Answer B is not correct.
 Weight attribute is only used locally in a router (not be exchanged between BGP neighbors) so we cannot affect BR2 from BR1 with this attribute -> Answer C is not correct.
 We cannot affect BR2 routing decision by modifying BGP advertisements from BR2 toward PE2 (inbound) -> A is not correct. Also if network 209.165.201.0/27 is advertised with “network” statement in BGP, BR2 will match it with origin “IGP”. Please check the example in the link below.
 By default, the MED attribute is set to 0 so by increasing the MED on PE2 toward BR2, BR2 would think the metric of its direct link to PE2 is higher than the path advertised by BR1 -> BR2 would use BR1 to reach 209.165.201.0/27.

An engineer configures VRRP and issues the show commands to verify operation. What does the engineer confirm about VRRP group 1 from the output?
A. There is no route to 10.10.1.1/32 in R2’s routing table
B. If R1 reboots, R2 becomes the master virtual router until R2 reboots
C. Communication between VRRP members is encrypted using MD5
D. R1 is master if 10.10.1.1/32 is in its routing table
  
Answer: D
 
Explanation
 We don’t have any information about the route to 10.10.1.1/32 so we cannot say if answer A is correct or not. Answer B is not correct because if R2 reboots, R2 only becomes the master until R1 is up again (not until R2 reboots) because “preempt” is enabled by default with VRRP. Answer C is not correct because R1 & R2 are authenticating via plain text, not MD5.

 R1 is tracking the route to 10.10.1.1/32, if this route is removed from R1’s routing table, the VRRP priority of R1 would be decreased by 20 (110 – 20 = 90) which is smaller than the priority of R2 -> R2 would take the master role ->
 Answer D is correct.

C. The keepalives are sent every 3 seconds and 5 retries.
D. The tunnel line protocol goes down when the keepalive counter reaches 5
  
Answer: B
 
Explanation
 The syntax of keepalive command is: keepalive {seconds retries} so R1 will send keepalive message every 5 seconds and retry 3 times. If all of the keepalive messages are failed, R1 concludes the tunnel was broken.

What is used to perform QoS packet classification?
A. the Options field in the Layer 3 header
B. the Type field in the Layer 2 frame
C. the Flags field in the Layer 3 header
D. the ToS field in the Layer 3 header
  
Answer: D
 
Explanation
 Layer-3 marking is accomplished using the 8-bit Type of Service (ToS) field, part of the IP header. A mark in this field will remain unchanged as it travels from hop-to-hop, unless a Layer-3 device is explicitly configured to overwrite this field. There are two marking methods that use the ToS field:
 + IP Precedence: uses the first three bits of the ToS field.
 + Differentiated Service Code Point (DSCP): uses the first six bits of the ToS field. When using DSCP, the ToS field is often referred to as the Differentiated Services (DS) field.

An engineer must provide wireless converge in a square office. The engineer has only one AP and believes that it should be placed it in the middle of the room. Which antenna type should the engineer use?
A. directional
B. polarized
C. Yagi
D. omnidirectional
  
Answer: D
 
Explanation
 Types of external antennas:
 + Omnidirectional: Provide 360-degree coverage. Ideal in houses and office areas
 + Directional: Focus the radio signal in a specific direction. Examples are the Yagi and parabolic dish
 + Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) – Uses multiple antennas (up to eight) to increase bandwidth
 An omnidirectional antenna is designed to provide a 360-degree radiation pattern. This type of antenna is used when coverage in all directions from the antenna is required.

How was spanning-tree configured on this interface?
A. By entering the command spanning-tree portfast trunk in the interface configuration mode.
B. By entering the command spanning-tree portfast in the interface configuration mode
C. By entering the command spanning-tree mst1 vlan 10,20,30,40 in the global configuration mode
D. By entering the command spanning-tree vlan 10,20,30,40 root primary in the interface configuration mode
  
Answer: A
 
Explanation
 As we see in the output, the type of this interface in all VLANs are “Edge” (which automatically transitions the port to the spanning tree forwarding state without passing through the blocking or learning states) so maybe this interface
 was configured with “portfast” command. There are many VLANs on this single interface so we can deduce it is a trunk port. Therefore the best answer here should be the command “spanning-tree portfast trunk” has been entered.
 
Question 25
An engineer is troubleshooting the AP join process using DNS. Which FQDN must be resolvable on the network for the access points to successfully register to the WLC?
A. cisco-capwap-controller.domain.com
B. wlchostname.domain.com
C. ap-manager.domain.com
D. primary-wlc.domain.com
  
Answer: A
 
Explanation
 The lightweight access points support the following controller discovery processes:
 ...
 DNS discovery—The access point can discover controllers through your domain name server (DNS). You must configure your DNS to return controller IP addresses in response to CISCO-CAPWAP-CONTROLLER.localdomain,
 where localdomain is the access point domain name. When an access point receives an IP address and DNS information from a DHCP server, it contacts the DNS to resolve CISCO-CAPWAP-CONTROLLER.localdomain. When the DNS sends a list of controller IP addresses, the access point sends discovery requests to the controllers.

Which measurement is used from a post wireless survey to depict the cell edge of the access points?
A. CCI
B. Noise
C. SNR
D. RSSI
  
Answer: D
 
Explanation
 The following are elements that you should consider when performing a post assessment of the environment.
 Analyze and define the cell edge: This requires the use of AirMagnet Survey, although there are simple tools like Omnipeek or Wireshark that can be used to measure wireless traffic as a client roams from one AP to another.
 According to design best practices that revolve around the Cell Edge Design, a wireless handset should roam before the RSSI reaches -67 dBm. You can analyze signal strength and determine the approximate cell edge by measuring the signal strength in a beacon frame as you move from the center of one cell towards the edge of that cell.

Packet
Src: 192.168.1.1, Dst: 192.168.3.1
TTL: 2
ICMP
Type: 8 (Echo ping request)

Devices between S1 and S2: R1, R2, R3
 
While troubleshooting a routing issue, an engineer issues a ping from S1 to S2. Which two actions from the initial value of the TTL? (Choose two)
A. The packet reaches R3, and the TTL expires
B. R2 replies with a TTL exceeded message
C. R1 replies with a TTL exceeded message
D. The packet reaches R2 and the TTL expires
E. R3 replies with a TTL exceeded message
F. The packet reaches R1 and the TTL expires
  
Answer: BD
 
Explanation
 “Routers decrement the TTL by 1 every time they forward a packet; if a router decrements the TTL to 0, it throws away the packet. This prevents packets from rotating forever.” We want to make it clear that before the router forwards a
 packet, the TTL is still remain the same.
 For example in the topology below, pings to S0/1 and S0/0 of Router 2 have the same TTL.
 If a router finds a TTL value of 1 or 0, it drops the datagram and sends an Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) time-to-live-exceeded message to the sender.
 Reference: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/routers/ir910/software/release/1_1/configuration/guide/ir910scg/s
  wtrbl.pdf
  The picture below shows TTL values for each interface of each router and for HostB. Notice that Host A initializes ICMP
 packet with a TTL of 255: 
  Therefore in this question, if the initial TTL is 2, then R1 receives the packet with TTL of 2, then it decreases the TTL
 before forwarding to R2. R2 receives packet with TTL of 1 then decreases the TTL to 0 so R2 drops the packet ( ->
 Answer D is correct). R2 also replies back to the source with an ICMPv4 Type 11, Code 0 Time Exceeded message ->
 Answer B is correct.

 Option A logs the whole subnet 172.20.10.0/24, not only host 172.20.10.1 so it is not correct.
 Option B does not log traffic coming from 172.20.10.1 so it is not correct.
 We tested option D but the command “access-list 100 seq 5 permit ip host 172.20.10.1 any log” is not accepted as shown below:

What is the function of a fabric border node in a Cisco SD-Access environment?
A. To connect the Cisco SD-Access fabric to another fabric or external Layer 3 networks
B. To collect traffic flow information toward external networks
C. To attach and register clients to the fabric
D. To handle an ordered list of IP addresses and locations for endpoints in the fabric.
  
Answer: A
 
Explanation
 There are five basic device roles in the fabric overlay:
 + Control plane node: This node contains the settings, protocols, and mapping tables to provide the endpoint-to- location (EID-to-RLOC) mapping system for the fabric overlay.
 + Fabric border node: This fabric device (for example, core layer device) connects external Layer 3 networks to the
 SDA fabric.
 + Fabric edge node: This fabric device (for example, access or distribution layer device) connects wired endpoints to the SDA fabric.
 + Fabric WLAN controller (WLC): This fabric device connects APs and wireless endpoints to the SDA fabric.
 + Intermediate nodes: These are intermediate routers or extended switches that do not provide any sort of SD-Access fabric role other than underlay services.

What is one benefit of implementing a VSS architecture?
A. It provides multiple points of management for redundancy and improved support.
B. It provides a single point of management for improved efficiency
C. It uses GLBP to balance traffic between gateways
D. It uses a single database to manage configuration for multiple switches
  
Answer: B
 
Explanation
 VSS increases operational efficiency by reducing switch management overhead and simplifying the network. It provides a single point of management, IP address, and routing instance.
 VSS can be managed with single management point from which you configure and manage the VSS. Neighbors see the VSS as a single Layer 2 switching or Layer 3 routing node, thus reducing the control protocol traffic. VSS provides a single VLAN gateway IP address, removing the need for the first-hop redundancy protocol (HSRP, VRRP, GLBP).
 Multichannel EtherChannel (MEC) allows you to bundle links to two physical switches in VSS, creating a loop-free redundant topology without the need for STP.

What does the response indicate?
A. The authentication credentials are incorrect
B. The URI string is incorrect
C. The Cisco DNA Center API port is incorrect
D. The HTTP method is incorrect
  
Answer: D
 
Explanation
 From the output, we learn that a “Response [405]” was returned. The 405 Method Not Allowed is an HTTP response status code indicating that the specified request HTTP method was received and recognized by the server, but the server has rejected that particular method for the requested resource. Therefore answer B is not correct.
 From this page (https://developer.cisco.com/docs/dna-center/#!command-runner/endpoints-and-methods-used), we
  may find out where the issue is:
 “The Authentication endpoint used in this guide is /dna/system/api/v1/auth/token, which is valid for version 1.2.6 and above. The HTTP method used for the endpoint is POST and it requires for the user to send its credentials using Basic Authentication.
 Note: For systems with versions below that, the endpoint is /api/system/v1/auth/token”
 Therefore the most suitable reason for this issue is we have to use “POST” instead of “GET” (in requests.get) ->

What is a consideration when designing a Cisco SD-Access underlay network?
A. End user subnets and endpoints are part of the underlay network
B. The underlay switches provide endpoint physical connectivity for users
C. Static routing is a requirement
D. It must support IPv4 and IPv6 underlay networks

What is the centralized control policy in a Cisco SD-WAN deployment?
A. list of ordered statements that define user access policies
B. list of enabled services for all nodes within the cloud
C. set of rules that governs nodes authentication within the cloud
D. set of statements that defines how routing is performed
  
Answer: D
 
Explanation
 In Cisco SD-WAN, there are two types of Centralized Control Policies that fulfill different objectives:
 + Topology – Topology policies control the route information such as omp, tloc, and service routes that are being redistributed to a list of sites. As the name implies, they are typically used for limiting the number of overlay tunnels between sites and controlling the overlay topology.
 + VPN Membership – VPN Membership policies are used to control the distribution of routing information for specific VPNs to a list of sites. A typical use-case is for creating guest networks that have Internet access but site-to-site communication is restricted.

A. from ncclient import *
B. import manager
C. from ncclient import
D. import ncclient manager
  
Answer: A
 
Explanation
 Importing a module (“ncclient” in this case) does not automatically import submodules/functions (“manager” in this case) so the above script causes error.
 Answer B is not correct as we cannot directly import “manager” as it is a function in “ncclient”.
 Answer C is not correct as we did not specify anything after keyword “import”.
 Answer D is not correct as it is missing a dot “.” (it should be “import ncclient.manager).

A. return (json.dumps({d[‘hostname’]: d[‘serialNumber’] for d in json.loads(test_json)[‘response’]}))
B. return (json.loads({for d in json.dumps(test_json)[‘response’]: d[‘hostname’]: d[‘serialNumber’]}))
C. return (json.loads({d[‘hostname’]: d[‘serialNumber’] for d in json.dumps(test_json)[‘response’]}))
D. return (json.dumps({for d in json.loads(test_json)[‘response’]: d[‘hostname’]: d[‘serialNumber’]}))
  
Answer: A
 
Explanation
 Our first variable test_json is a string which we cannot loop through so we have to convert it into a dictionary type first with json.loads() function -> Therefore we must use “json.loads(test_json)[‘response’]”, not json.dumps(...) in the for loop. Then we can use the for loop to iterate through the dictionary. The script below is an example:
      import json
   json_string = '{"key1": "value1", "key2": "value2"}'
      #Load JSON string to a dictionary
   json_dictionary = json.loads(json_string)
      #Loop through dictionary keys
   for key in json_dictionary:
   print(key, ":", json_dictionary[key])
      OUTPUT:
   key1 : value1
   key2 : value2
   
 -> Only answer A and answer D are correct.
 We also tested both of the answers in Atom, only the first answer is correct:
  The second one returned error:
   
 -> Only answer A is correct.
 Note:
 + json.dumps() function converts a Python object into a json string. For example: json.dumps({‘name’: ‘John’,’age’:
 ’20’})
 + json.loads() method parses a valid JSON string and convert it into a Python Dictionary.
 
Question 51
 Which two operational models enable an AP to scan one or more wireless channels for rouge access points and at the same time provide wireless services to clients? (Choose two)
A. Sniffer
B. Rouge detector
C. Local
D. FlexConnect
E. Monitor
  
Answer: CD
 
Explanation
 An LAP operates in one of six different modes:
 + Local mode (default mode): measures noise floor and interference, and scans for intrusion detection (IDS) events every 180 seconds on unused channels
 + FlexConnect, formerly known as Hybrid Remote Edge AP (H-REAP), mode: allows data traffic to be switched locally and not go back to the controller. The FlexConnect AP can perform standalone client authentication and switch VLAN
 traffic locally even when it’s disconnected to the WLC (Local Switched). FlexConnect AP can also tunnel (via CAPWAP)
 both user wireless data and control traffic to a centralized WLC (Central Switched).
 + Monitor mode: does not handle data traffic between clients and the infrastructure. It acts like a sensor for location-
 based services (LBS), rogue AP detection, and IDS
 + Rogue detector mode: monitor for rogue APs. It does not handle data at all.
 + Sniffer mode: run as a sniffer and captures and forwards all the packets on a particular channel to a remote machine
 where you can use protocol analysis tool (Wireshark, Airopeek, etc) to review the packets and diagnose issues. Strictly used for troubleshooting purposes.
 + Bridge mode: bridge together the WLAN and the wired infrastructure together.
 + Sensor mode: this is a special mode which is not listed in the books but you need to know. In this mode, the device can actually function much like a WLAN client would associating and identifying client connectivity issues within the
 network in real time without requiring an IT or technician to be on site.
 Although Monitor and Rogue detector mode can detect rough APs but they do not handle data so they are not correct.
 Rogue Detection
 A rogue is essentially any device that shares your spectrum, but is not in your control. This includes rogue Access Points, wireless router, rogue clients, and rogue ad-hoc networks. The Cisco UWN uses a number of methods to detect
 Wi-Fi-based rogue devices such as off-channel scanning and dedicated monitor mode capabilities. Cisco Spectrum Expert can also be used to identify rogue devices not based on the 802.11 protocol, such as Bluetooth bridges.
 Off-Channel Scanning
 This operation is performed by Local and Flex-Connect (in connected mode) mode APs and utilizes a time-slicing technique which allows client service and channel scanning with the usage of the same radio.

Which of the following are related to OSPF? (Choose four)
A. supports virtual links
B. can automatically summarize networks at the boundary
C. requires manual configuration of network summarization
D. uses Dijkstra’s Shortest Path First algorithm
E. uses Diffused Update Algorithm
F. uses bandwidth, delay, reliability and load for routing metric
G. uses an election process

Answer: ACDG

Explanation
 Unlike OSPF where we can summarize only on ABR or ASBR, in EIGRP we can summarize anywhere.
 Manual summarization can be applied anywhere in EIGRP domain, on every router, on every interface via the ip summary-address eigrp as-number address mask [administrative-distance ] command (for example: ip summary- address eigrp 1 192.168.16.0 255.255.248.0). Summary route will exist in routing table as long as at least one more specific route will exist. If the last specific route will disappear, summary route also will fade out. The metric used by EIGRP manual summary route is the minimum metric of the specific routes.

Question 65 - Checked
Rapid PVST+ is enabled on all switches. Which command set must be configured on Switch1 to achieve the following results on port fa0/1?

 + When a device is connected, the port transitions immediately to a forwarding state
 + The interface should not send or receive BPDUs.
 + If a BPDU is received, it continues operating normally.

A.
 Switch1(config)# interface f0/1
 Switch1(config-if)# spanning-tree portfast
 Switch1(config-if)# spanning-tree bpduguard enable

B.
 Switch1(config)# spanning-tree portfast bpduguard default
 Switch1(config)# interface f0/1
 Switch1(config-if)# spanning-tree portfast

C.
 Switch1(config)#interface f0/1
 Switch1(config-if)# spanning-tree portfast

D.
 Switch1(config)#spanning-tree portfast bpdufilter default
 Switch1(config)# interface f0/1
 Switch1(config-if)# spanning-tree portfast
  
Answer: D
 
Explanation
 BPDU Guard feature allows STP to shut an access port in the event of receiving a BPDU and put that port into err- disabled state so it is not the answer we want here.
 BPDUFilter is designed to suppress the sending and receiving of BPDUs on an interface. If a BPDU is received on a Port Fast-enabled interface, the interface loses its Port Fast-operational status, and BPDU filtering is disabled -> BPDUFilter is the answer we want.
 There are two ways to configure BPDU filtering feature, one in global configuration mode and one under a specific interface:
 Configuring BPDU filter globally:
 Switch(config)#spanning-tree portfast bpdufilter default
 Configure BPDU Filter on the interface:
 Switch(config-if)#spanning-tree bpdufilter enable (this overrides the global bpdufilter command above)
 But the effect of these two commands are different and you should remember:
 + When BPDU filtering is enabled globally; and if BPDUs are seen, the port loses its PortFast status, BPDU filtering is disabled, the port returns to normal state
 + When BPDU filtering is enabled on a specific port, it prevents this port from sending or receiving BPDUs (so if BPDUs are seen, they will be dropped)

After running the code in the exhibit. Which step reduces the amount of data that NETCONF server returns to the NETCONF client, to only the interface’s configuration?
A. Create an XML filter as a string and pass it to get_config() method as an argument
B. Use the txml library to parse the data returned by the NETCONF server for the interface’s configuration
C. Create a JSON filter as a string and pass it to the get_config() method as an argument
D. Use the JSON library to parse the data returned by the NETCONF server for the interface’s configuration
  
Answer: A
 
Explanation
 Sometimes we are only interested in a very particular part of the config. NETCONF accomodates this with the ability to specify a filter. In below script, we will specify a filter that only shows the information for interface GigabitEthernet3.
 The get_config also accepts a filter parameter (documentation). So in below script, we will simply pass that filter to the get_config method and see what happens.

 R1(config-router)#neighbor CORP password Cisco
E.
 R2(config-router)#neighbor 10.120.10.1 peer-group CORP
 R2(config-router)#neighbor CORP password Cisco
  
Answer: CE
 
Explanation
 The above message (“...Invalid MD5 digest from 10.10.10.1 (29832) to 10.120.10.1...”) was received on R1 so we can deduce the IP address of R1 is 10.120.10.1 and the IP address of R2 is 10.10.10.1. Therefore on R1 we have to configure “neighbor 10.10.10.1 ...” while on R2 we have to use “neighbor 10.120.10.1 ...”

Which device makes the decision for a wireless client to roam?
A. wireless client
B. access point
C. wireless LAN controller

Answer: A
 
Explanation
 Roaming is a client side decision in 802.11 WiFi. Client devices listen for beacon frames or send probe requests to discover APs advertising the preferred SSID. The clients driver uses the received signal strength of beacons or probe responses to make decisions on whether to change APs or remain connected to the current AP.

A network engineer configures a new GRE tunnel and enters the show run command. What does the output verify?
A. The tunnel keepalive is configured incorrectly because they must match on both sites
B. The tunnel destination will be known via the tunnel interface
C. The tunnel will be established and work as expected
D. The default MTU of the tunnel interface is 1500 byte.
  
Answer: B
 
Explanation
 GRE keepalive packets may be sent from both sides of a tunnel or from just one side. If they are sent from both sides, the period and retry parameters can be different at each side of the link -> Answer A is not correct.
 Tunnel interfaces by default will have 1476 bytes MTU. 24 bytes less the physical -> Answer D is not correct.
 In this question, we turned on OSPF on all active interfaces (with the “network 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255 area 0” command). So on SiteB the tunnel interface (192.168.100.2) is also running OSPF. When SiteA receives the OSPF advertisement from SiteB, it realizes it can reach the other side of the tunnel via OSPF (and it would not use the default route any more). In other words, it reaches the tunnel destination through the tunnel itself -> This causes “recursive routing” error.
 Note: In order to avoid this error, do not advertise the tunnel destination IP address on the tunnel interface to other side.

An engineer has configured Cisco ISE to assign VLANs to clients based on their method of authentication, but this is not working as expected. Which action will resolve this issue?
A. require a DHCP address assignment
B. utilize RADIUS profiling
C. set a NAC state
D. enable AAA override

Answer: D
 
Explanation
 Dynamic VLAN assignment is one such feature that places a wireless user into a specific VLAN based on the credentials supplied by the user. This task of assigning users to a specific VLAN is handled by a RADIUS authentication server,
 such as Cisco ISE. This can be used, for example, to allow the wireless host to remain on the same VLAN as it moves within a campus network.
 ...
 In order to accomplish dynamic VLAN assignment with WLCs based on ISE to AD group mapping, these steps must be performed:
 + ISE to AD integration and configuration of authentication and authorization policies for users on ISE
 + WLC configuration to support dot1x authentication and AAA override for correspondent SSID
 + End client supplicant configuration

If the noise floor is -90 dBm and the wireless client is receiving a signal of -75 dBm, what is the SNR?
A. -165
B. 83
C. 15
D. 1.2
  
Answer: C
 
Explanation
 If your SNR measurements are already in decibel form, then you can subtract the noise quantity from the desired signal: SNR = S – N. This is because when you subtract logarithms, it is the equivalent of dividing normal numbers.
 Also, the difference in the numbers equals the SNR. In this question, SNR = -75 – (-90) = 15.

Which design principle states that a user has no access by default to any resource, and unless a resource is explicitly granted, it should be denied?
A. complete mediation
B. least privilege
C. economy of mechanism
D. fail-safe defaults
  
Answer: D
 
Explanation
 The Principle of Fail-Safe Defaults states that, unless a subject is given explicit access to an object, it should be denied access to that object.
 Note: By the principle of least privilege, that administrator should only be able to access the subjects and objects involved in mail queueing and delivery.

An engineer implemented several configuration changes and receives the logging message on Switch1. Which action should the engineer take to resolve this issue?
A. Change Switch1 to switch port mode dynamic desirable
B. Change Switch2 to switch port mode dynamic auto
C. Change Switch1 to switch port mode dynamic auto
D. Change the VTP domain to match on both switches
  
Answer: D
 
Explanation
 We can configure “switchport mode trunk” and “switchport mode dynamic desirable” on two ends with no problem. But trunking can be configured only when the ports belong to the same VTP domain.

Answer: A
 
Explanation
 From the output, we learn that both interfaces are in “auto” mode so they cannot establish a trunk. We have to change one (or both) of them to “desirable” mode.

What is the difference in dBm when an AP power increases from 25 mW to 100mW?
A. 75dBm
B. 150dBm
C. 6dBm
D. 125dBm
 
Answer: C
 
Explanation
 Formula to convert from mW to dBm:
 P(dBm) = 10log10(mW)
 Therefore:
 + 25mW converts to dBm: 10log10(25)= 13.98dBm
 + 100mW converts to dBm: 10log10(100) = 20dBm
 The difference between them is about 6dBm.
 Or a shorter way from the formula:
 logAB – logAC = logA(B/C)
 Then 10log10(100) – 10log10(25) = 10log10(100/25) = 10log10(4) = 6.02

   d = datetime.date.today()
   date = str(10000*d.year + 100*d.month +D.day)
    
Refer to the exhibit. Which result does the python code achieve?
A. The code converts time to the yyyymmdd representation
B. The code encrypts a base64 decrypted password
C. The code converts time to the “year/month/day” time format
D. The code converts time to the Epoch LINUX time format
  
Answer: A
 
Explanation
 There are two results in the code above:
 + The first result is in the first line with “psswd” variable. The purpose of this line is to decrypt (not encrypt) an encrypted base64 string -> Answer B is not correct.
 + The second result is in the last line with “date” variable. Let’s take an example with the date 16th-Aug-2021 to see how the “date” variable is calculated:
 date = 10000 * 2021 + 100 * 8 + 16 = 20210000 + 800 + 16 = 20210816 -> Therefore the date is in yyyymmdd format.

B. configure switchport nonegotiate on SW2
C. configure switchport mode trunk on SW2
D. configure switchport mode dynamic desirable on SW2
E. configure no switchport nonegotiate on SW1
  
Answer: CD
 
Explanation
 From the outputs (line: “Administrative Mode: dynamic auto”) we notice that both interfaces were configured with “dynamic auto” mode so they cannot form a trunking link. We need to change one of them to “dynamic desirable” mode or “switchport mode trunk” to activate the trunk -> Answer C and answer D are correct.
 For your reference, the table below lists trunking condition:
  Note:
 In fact, there is an issue with the output of SW1 because both the command “switchport mode dynamic auto” mode (from the line: Administrative Mode: dynamic auto) and “switchport nonegotiate” (from the line: Negotiation of Trunking: Off) were used. But in practical we cannot use these two commands at the same time.
 – If the first command was entered and we use the second one, this error will be shown:
 “Command rejected: Conflict between ‘nonegotiate’ and ‘dynamic’ status on this interface: Et0/3”
 – If the second command was entered and we use the first one, this error will be shown:
 “Command rejected: An interface must be configured to the “Access” or “Trunk” modes to be configured to
 “NoNegotiate.””

Extended access-list 100 is configured on interface GigabitEthernet0/0 in an inbound direction, but it does not have the expected behavior of allowing only packets to or from 192.168.0.0/16. Which command set properly configures the access list?
A. Option A
B. Option B

An engineer is configuring an EtherChannel between Switch1 and Switch2 and notices the console message on Switch2. Based on the output, which action resolves this issue?
A. Configure the same port channel interface number on both switches
B. Configure less member ports on Switch2
C. Configure more member ports on Switch1
D. Configure the same EtherChannel protocol on both switches
  
Answer: D
 
Explanation
 In this case, we are using your EtherChannel without a negotiation protocol on Switch2. As a result, if the opposite switch is not configured for EtherChannel operation on the respective ports either, there is a danger of a switching
 loop. The EtherChannel Misconfiguration Guard tries to prevent that loop from occurring by disabling all the ports bundled in the EtherChannel.

A. Option A
B. Option B
C. Option C
D. Option D
  
Answer: C
 
Explanation
 We need a “if” condition here to find out disabled interfaces so Option A is not correct.
 From the exhibit, we learn that the “netconf_data” array only has “enabled” element. It does not have “disabled” element so Option B is not correct.
 If “enabled” element is not “true” (interface[“enabled”] != ‘true’) then it is a disable interface -> Option C is correct.
 
Question 18
An engineer must deny HTTP traffic from host A to host B while allowing all other communication between the hosts. Drag and drop the commands into the configuration to achieve these results. Some commands may be used more than once. Not all commands are used.

vlan filter HOST-A-B vlan 10

A. action drop
B. action forward
C. filter
D. match
E. deny
F. permit

Answer: FFAB

Explanation
permit, permit, action drop, action forward

 In this case we need to configure a VLAN access-map to deny HTTP traffic and apply it to VLAN 10. To do it, first create an access-list, by which interesting traffic will be matched. The principle of VLAN access-map config is similar to the route-map principle.
 After this we’ll create a vlan access-map, which has two main parameters: action and match.
 Match: by this parameter the interesting traffic is matched and here RACL or MAC ACL can be applied as well.
 Action: what to do with matched traffic. Two main parameters exist: Drop and Forward. In case of Drop, matched traffic will be dropped, and in case of forward, matched traffic will be allowed.
 A good reference and example can be found at https://www.networkstraining.com/vlan-access-map-example-  configuration/
  In this question, we have to permit both ACL because the matched traffic will be decided by the VLAN Access map
 below (forward or drop).

Question 20
What is an advantage of using BFD?
A. It detects local link failure at layer 1 and updates routing table
B. It detects local link failure at layer 3 and updates routing protocols
C. It has sub-second failure detection for layer 1 and layer 3 problems.
D. It has sub-second failure detection for layer 1 and layer 2 problems.
  
Answer: B
 
Explanation
 BFD works only for directly connected neighbors. BFD neighbors must be no more than one IP hop away. Multihop configurations are not supported -> “BFD detects local link failure” is correct.
 Typically, BFD can be used at any protocol layer. However, the Cisco implementation of BFD for Cisco IOS Releases 12.2(18)SXE, 12.0(31)S, and 12.4(4)T supports only Layer 3 clients, in particular, the BGP, EIGRP, IS-IS, and OSPF routing protocols.
 Reference: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios/12_0s/feature/guide/fs_bfd.html
  According to the reference above, it is a bit weird but answer B is the best choice here.
 
Question 21
An engineer measures the Wi-Fi coverage at a customer site. The RSSI values are recorded as follows:
     
Location A: -72 dBm 
Location B: -75 dBm 
Location C: -65 dBm 
Location D: -80 dBm
  
Which two statements does the engineer use to explain these values to the customer? (Choose two)
A. The signal strength at location C is too weak to support web surfing
B. Location D has the strongest RF signal strength
C. The RF signal strength at location B is 50% weaker than location A
D. The signal strength at location B is 10 dB better than location C
E. The RF signal strength at location C is 10 times stronger than location B
  
Answer: CE
 
Explanation
 Understanding Signal Strength
 The most accurate way to express it is with milliwatts (mW), but you end up with tons of decimal places due to WiFi’s super-low transmit power, making it difficult to read. For example, -40 dBm is 0.0001 mW, and the zeros just get more intense the more the signal strength drops.
 Ultimately, the easiest and most consistent way to express signal strength is with dBm, which stands for decibels relative to a milliwatt.
 1 mW = 0 dBm
 You can convert between mW and dBm using the following formulas:
     P(dBm) = 10 · log10(P(mW))
For example, a power of 2.5 mW in dBm is: P(dBm) = 10log102.5 = 3.979
   dBm is that we’re working in negatives. -30 is a higher (stronger) signal than -80.
    Signal Strength
       Rating
            Required for
   -30 dBm
   Amazing
   Max achievable signal strength. The client can only be a few feet from the AP to achieve this. Not typical or desirable in the real world.
    N/A
    -67 dBm
   Very Good
 Minimum signal strength for applications that require very reliable, timely delivery of data packets.
   VoIP/VoWiFi, streaming video
    -70 dBm
       Okay
       Minimum signal strength for reliable packet delivery.
       Email, web
     -80 dBm
   Not Good
 Minimum signal strength for basic connectivity. Packet delivery may be unreliable.
   N/A
     -90 dBm
       Unusable
     Approaching or drowning in the noise floor. Any functionality is highly unlikely.
      N/A
    3 dB of gain = +3 dB = doubles signal strength (Let’s say, the base is P. So 10*log10(P/P)= 0 dB and
 10*log10(2P/P) = 10*log10(2) = 3dB -> double signal)
 3 dB of loss = -3 dB = halves signal strength strength (10*log(1⁄2) = -3.0103)
 10 dB of loss = -10 dB = 10 times less signal strength (0.1 mW = -10 dBm, 0.01 mW = -20 dBm, etc.)
 10 dB of gain = +10 dB = 10 times more signal strength (0.00001 mW = -50 dBm, 0.0001 mW = -40 dBm, etc.)
 Reference: https://www.metageek.com/training/resources/wifi-signal-strength-basics.html
  Simple rule of thumb:
 When working with power, 3 dB means double (twice) the factor and 10 dB means 10-fold.
 Note: In this question, answer A may be correct but it is not obvious. Also in this question, dB and dBm can be used interchangeable.

Question 23 - Checked
 Which unit is used to express the signal-to-noise ratio?
A. dBm

Answer: B
 
Explanation
 Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR or S/N) is the ratio of signal power to the noise power, and its unit of expression is typically decibels (dB).

B. (config-if)#keepalive {seconds retries}
C. (config-if)#ip mtu {value}
D. (config-if)#ip tcp adjust-mss {value}
  
Answer: A
 
Explanation
 A GRE interface definition includes:
 + An IPv4 address on the tunnel
 + A tunnel source
 + A tunnel destination
  
Below is an example of how to configure a basic GRE tunnel:
interface Tunnel 0
ip address 10.10.10.1 255.255.255.0 tunnel source fa0/0
tunnel destination 172.16.0.2
In this case the “IPv4 address on the tunnel” is 10.10.10.1/24 and “sourced the tunnel from an Ethernet interface” is
the command “tunnel source fa0/0”. Therefore it only needs a tunnel destination, which is 172.16.0.2.
Note: A multiple GRE (mGRE) interface does not require a tunnel destination address.

Answer: C

Explanation
CoPP protects the route processor on network devices by treating route processor resources as a separate entity with its own ingress interface (and in some implementations, egress also). CoPP is used to police traffic that is destined to the route processor of the router such as:
+ Routing protocols like OSPF, EIGRP, or BGP.
+ Gateway redundancy protocols like HSRP, VRRP, or GLBP.
+ Network management protocols like telnet, SSH, SNMP, or RADIUS.
 Therefore we must apply the CoPP to deal with SSH because it is in the management plane. CoPP must be put under “control-plane” command.

Which two namespaces does the LISP network architecture and protocol use? (Choose two)
A. TLOC 
B. RLOC 
C. DNS
D. VTEP 
E. EID

Answer: BE 

Explanation
Locator ID Separation Protocol (LISP) is a network architecture and protocol that implements the use of two namespaces instead of a single IP address:
+ Endpoint identifiers (EIDs)—assigned to end hosts.
+ Routing locators (RLOCs)—assigned to devices (primarily routers) that make up the global routing system.

Which First Hop Redundancy Protocol should be used to meet a design requirements for more efficient default bandwidth usage across multiple devices?

A. GLBP
B. LCAP 
C. HSRP 
D. VRRP

Answer: A

Explanation
The main disadvantage of HSRP and VRRP is that only one gateway is elected to be the active gateway and used to forward traffic whilst the rest are unused until the active one fails. Gateway Load Balancing Protocol (GLBP) is a Cisco proprietary protocol and performs the similar function to HSRP and VRRP but it supports load balancing among members in a GLBP group.

Question 12
What are two reasons why broadcast radiation is caused in the virtual machine environment? (Choose two)
A. vSwitch must interrupt the server CPU to process the broadcast packet 
B. The Layer 2 domain can be large in virtual machine environments
C. Virtual machines communicate primarily through broadcast mode
D. Communication between vSwitch and network switch is broadcast based 
E. Communication between vSwitch and network switch is multicast based

Answer: BC

Explanation
Broadcast radiation is the accumulation of broadcast and multicast traffic on a computer network. Extreme amounts of broadcast traffic constitute a broadcast storm.
The amount of broadcast traffic you should see within a broadcast domain is directly proportional to the size of the broadcast domain. Therefore if the layer 2 domain in virtual machine environment is too large, broadcast radiation may occur -> VLANs should be used to reduce broadcast radiation.
Also if virtual machines communicate via broadcast too much, broadcast radiation may occur.
Another reason for broadcast radiation is using a trunk (to extend VLANs) from the network switch to the physical server.
—————————————————————- Note about the structure of virtualization in a hypervisor:
Hypervisors provide virtual switch (vSwitch) that Virtual Machines (VMs) use to communicate with other VMs on the same host. The vSwitch may also be connected to the host’s physical NIC to allow VMs to get layer 2 access to the outside world.
Each VM is provided with a virtual NIC (vNIC) that is connected to the virtual switch. Multiple vNICs can connect to a single vSwitch, allowing VMs on a physical host to communicate with one another at layer 2 without having to go out to a physical switch.
Although vSwitch does not run Spanning-tree protocol but vSwitch implements other loop prevention mechanisms. For example, a frame that enters from one VMNIC is not going to go out of the physical host from a different VMNIC card.

Question 14
When a wireless client roams between two different wireless controllers, a network connectivity outage is experience for a period of time. Which configuration issue would cause this problem?

A. Not all of the controllers in the mobility group are using the same mobility group name
B. Not all of the controllers within the mobility group are using the same virtual interface IP address 
C. All of the controllers within the mobility group are using the same virtual interface IP address
D. All of the controllers in the mobility group are using the same mobility group name

Answer: B

Explanation
A prerequisite for configuring Mobility Groups is “All controllers must be configured with the same virtual interface IP address”. If all the controllers within a mobility group are not using the same virtual interface, inter- controller roaming may appear to work, but the handoff does not complete, and the client loses connectivity for a period of time. -> Answer B is correct.
Reference: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/wireless/controller/8-5/config- guide/b_cg85/mobility_groups.html
Answer A is not correct because when the client moves to a different mobility group (with different mobility group name), that client would be connected (provided that the new connected controller had information about this client in its mobility list already) or drop (if the new connected controller have not had information about this client in its mobility list). For more information please read the note below.
Note:
A mobility group is a set of controllers, identified by the same mobility group name, that defines the realm of seamless roaming for wireless clients. By creating a mobility group, you can enable multiple controllers in a network to dynamically share information and forward data traffic when inter-controller or inter-subnet roaming occurs. Controllers in the same mobility group can share the context and state of client devices as well as their list of access points so that they do not consider each other’s access points as rogue devices.
Let’s take an example:
The controllers in the ABC mobility group share access point and client information with each other. The controllers in the ABC mobility group do not share the access point or client information with the XYZ controllers, which are in a different mobility group. Therefore if a client from ABC mobility group moves to XYZ mobility group, and the new connected controller does not have information about this client in its mobility list, that client will be dropped.
Note: Clients may roam between access points in different mobility groups if the controllers are included in each other’s mobility lists.

Which method of account authentication does OAuth 2.0 within REST APIs?
A. username/role combination 
B. access tokens
C. cookie authentication
D. basic signature workflow

Answer: B 

Explanation
The most common implementations of OAuth (OAuth 2.0) use one or both of these tokens:
+ access token: sent like an API key, it allows the application to access a user’s data; optionally, access tokens can expire.
+ refresh token: optionally part of an OAuth flow, refresh tokens retrieve a new access token if they have expired. OAuth2 combines Authentication and Authorization to allow more sophisticated scope and validity control.

access-list 1 permit 172.16.1.0 0.0.0.255
ip nat inside source list 1 interface gigabitethernet0/0 overload

The inside and outside interfaces in the NAT configuration of this device have been correctly identified. What is the effect of this configuration?
A. dynamic NAT 
B. static NAT
C. PAT
D. NAT64

Answer: C

Explanation
The command “ip nat inside source list 1 interface gigabitethernet0/0 overload” translates all source addresses that pass access list 1, which means 172.16.1.0/24 subnet, into an address assigned to gigabitethernet0/0 interface. Overload keyword allows to map multiple IP addresses to a single registered IP address (many-toone) by using different ports so it is called Port Address Translation (PAT).

Answer: C

Explanation
CoPP protects the route processor on network devices by treating route processor resources as a separate entity with its own ingress interface (and in some implementations, egress also). CoPP is used to police traffic that is destined to the route processor of the router such as:
+ Routing protocols like OSPF, EIGRP, or BGP.
+ Gateway redundancy protocols like HSRP, VRRP, or GLBP.
+ Network management protocols like telnet, SSH, SNMP, or RADIUS.
Therefore we must apply the CoPP to deal with SSH because it is in the management plane. CoPP must be put under “control-plane” command.

Question 5 - Checked
What NTP stratum level is a server that is connected directly to an authoritative time source?
A. Stratum 0 
B. Stratum 1 
C. Stratum 14 
D. Stratum 15

Answer: B

Explanation
The stratum levels define the distance from the reference clock. A reference clock is a stratum 0 device that is assumed to be accurate and has little or no delay associated with it. Stratum 0 servers cannot be used on the network but they are directly connected to computers which then operate as stratum-1 servers. A stratum 1 time server acts as a primary network time standard.
A stratum 2 server is connected to the stratum 1 server; then a stratum 3 server is connected to the stratum 2 server and so on. A stratum 2 server gets its time via NTP packet requests from a stratum 1 server. A stratum 3 server gets its time via NTP packet requests from a stratum-2 server... A stratum server may also peer with other stratum servers at the same level to provide more stable and robust time for all devices in the peer group (for example a stratum 2 server can peer with other stratum 2 servers).
NTP uses the concept of a stratum to describe how many NTP hops away a machine is from an authoritative time source. A stratum 1 time server typically has an authoritative time source (such as a radio or atomic clock, or a Global Positioning System (GPS) time source) directly attached, a stratum 2 time server receives its time via NTP from a stratum 1 time server, and so on.

A company plans to implement intent-based networking in its campus infrastructure. Which design facilities a migrate from a traditional campus design to a programmer fabric designer?
A. two-tier
B. Layer 2 access
C. three-tier
D. routed access

Answer: A

Explanation
Intent-based Networking (IBN) transforms a hardware-centric, manual network into a controller-led network that captures business intent and translates it into policies that can be automated and applied consistently across the network. The goal is for the network to continuously monitor and adjust network performance to help assure desired business outcomes. IBN builds on software-defined networking (SDN). SDN usually uses spine- leaf architecture, which is typically deployed as two layers: spines (such as an aggregation layer), and leaves (such as an access layer).

Which algorithms are used to secure REST API from brute attacks and minimize the impact?
A. SHA-1, SHA-256, and SHA-512
B. PBKDF2, BCrypt, and SCrypt
C. SHA-512 and SHA-384
D. MD5 algorithm-128 and SHA-384

Answer: B

Explanation
One of the best practices to secure REST APIs is using password hash. Passwords must always be hashed to protect the system (or minimize the damage) even if it is compromised in some hacking attempts. There are many such hashing algorithms which can prove really effective for password securityE.g. PBKDF2, bcrypt and scrypt algorithms.
Other ways to secure REST APIs are: Always use HTTPS, Never expose information on URLs (Usernames, passwords, session tokens, and API keys should not appear in the URL), Adding Timestamp in Request, Using OAuth, Input Parameter Validation.
Reference: https://restfulapi.net/security-essentials/
We should not use MD5 or any SHA (SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-512...) algorithm to hash
password as they are not totally secure.
Note: answer 'SHA-512 and SHA-384' brute-force attack is an attempt to discover a password by systematically trying every possible combination of letters, numbers, and symbols until you discover the one correct combination that works.

Question 8
When a wireless client roams between two different wireless controllers, a network connectivity outage is experience for a period of time. Which configuration issue would cause this problem?   
A. All of the controllers in the mobility group are using the same mobility group name
B. Not all of the controllers in the mobility group are using the same mobility group name
C. Not all of the controllers within the mobility group are using the same virtual interface IP address
D. All of the controllers within the mobility group are using the same virtual interface IP address

Answer: C

Explanation
A prerequisite for configuring Mobility Groups is “All controllers must be configured with the same virtual interface IP address”. If all the controllers within a mobility group are not using the same virtual interface, inter-controller roaming may appear to work, but the handoff does not complete, and the client loses connectivity for a period of time. -> Answer 'Not all of the controllers within the mobility group are using the same virtual interface IP address' is correct.
Reference: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/wireless/controller/8-5/config- guide/b_cg85/mobility_groups.html
Answer 'Not all of the controllers in the mobility group are using the same mobility group name' is not correct because when the client moves to a different mobility group (with different mobility group name), that client would be connected (provided that the new connected controller had information about this client in its mobility list already) or drop (if the new connected controller have not had information about this client in its mobility list). For more information please read the note below.
Note:
A mobility group is a set of controllers, identified by the same mobility group name, that defines the realm of seamless roaming for wireless clients. By creating a mobility group, you can enable multiple controllers in a network to dynamically share information and forward data traffic when inter-controller or inter-subnet roaming occurs. Controllers in the same mobility group can share the context and state of client devices as well as their list of access points so that they do not consider each other’s access points as rogue devices.
  
 Let’s take an example:
The controllers in the ABC mobility group share access point and client information with each other. The controllers in the ABC mobility group do not share the access point or client information with the XYZ controllers, which are in a different mobility group. Therefore if a client from ABC mobility group moves to XYZ mobility group, and the new connected controller does not have information about this client in its mobility list, that client will be dropped.
Note: Clients may roam between access points in different mobility groups if the controllers are included in each other’s mobility lists.

What is the process of password checks when a login attempt is made to the device?
A. A local database is checked first. If that check fails, a TACACS+server is checked
B. A TACACS+ server is checked first. If that check fail, a database is checked
C. A local database is checked first. If that fails, a TACACS+server is checked, if
that check fails, a RADIUS server is checked
D. A TACACS+ server is checked first. If that check fail, a RADIUS server is
checked. If that check fail, a local database is checked 

Answer: A

Explanation
The “aaa authentication login default local group tacacs+” command is broken down as follows:
+ The ‘aaa authentication’ part is simply saying we want to configure authentication settings.
+ The ‘login’ is stating that we want to prompt for a username/password when a connection is made to the device.
+ The ‘default’ means we want to apply for all login connections (such as tty, vty, console and aux). If we use this keyword, we don’t need to configure anything else under tty, vty and aux lines. If we don’t use this keyword then we have to specify which line(s) we want to apply the authentication feature.
+ The ‘local group tacacs+” means all users are authenticated using router’s local database (the first method). If the credentials are not found on the local database, then the TACACS+ server is used (the second method).

Question 10
Drag and drop the REST API authentication method from the left to the description on the right.
A.
secure vault - public API resource
HTTP basic authentication - username and password in an encoded string 
OAuth - API-dependent secret
token-based authentication - authorization through identity provider

Answer: ABCDEFGHIJKLM

Explanation
When Secure Vault is not in use, all information stored in its container is encrypted. When a user wants to use the files and notes stored within the app, they have to first decrypt the database. This happens by filling in a previously determined Security Lock – which could be a PIN or a password of the user’s choosing.       
When a user leaves the app, it automatically encrypts everything again. This way all data stored in Secure Vault is decrypted only while a user is actively using the app. In all other instances, it remains locked to any attacker, malware or spyware trying to access the data.
How token-based authentication works: Users log in to a system and – once authenticated – are provided with a token to access other services without having to enter their username and password multiple times. In short, token-based authentication adds a second layer of security to application, network, or service access.
OAuth is an open standard for authorization used by many APIs and modern applications. The simplest example of OAuth is when you go to log onto a website and it offers one or more opportunities to log on using another website’s/service’s logon. You then click on the button linked to the other website, the other website authenticates you, and the website you were originally connecting to logs you on itself afterward using permission gained from the second website.

Question 12
A client device roams between access points located on different floors in an atrium. The access points joined to the same controller and configuration in local mode. The access points are in different IP addresses, but the client VLAN in the group same. What type of roam occurs?
A. intra-controller
B. inter-subnet
C. intra-VLAN
D. inter-controller

Answer: B

Explanation
Mobility, or roaming, is a wireless LAN client’s ability to maintain its association seamlessly from one access point to another securely and with as little latency as possible. Three popular types of client roaming are:
Intra-Controller Roaming: Each controller supports same-controller client roaming across access points managed by the same controller. This roaming is transparent to the client as the session is sustained, and the client continues using the same DHCP-assigned or client-assigned IP address.
Inter-Controller Roaming: Multiple-controller deployments support client roaming across access points managed by controllers in the same mobility group and on the same subnet. This roaming is also transparent to the client because the session is sustained and a tunnel between controllers allows the client to continue using the same DHCP- or client-assigned IP address as long as the session remains active.
Inter-Subnet Roaming: Multiple-controller deployments support client roaming across access points managed by controllers in the same mobility group on different subnets. This roaming is transparent to the client because the session is sustained and a tunnel between the controllers allows the client to continue using the same DHCP-assigned or client-assigned IP address as long as the session remains active.

There is no software or any operating system in between, hence the name bare-metal hypervisor. answer 'Oracle VM VirtualBox' Type 1 hypervisor is proven in providing excellent performance and stability since it does not run inside Windows or any other operating system. These are the most common type 1 hypervisors:
+ VMware vSphere with ESX/ESXi
+ KVM (Kernel-Based Virtual Machine)
+ Microsoft Hyper-V
+ Oracle VM
+ Citrix Hypervisor (formerly known as Xen Server)

Question 22
An engineer must protect their company against ransom ware attacks. Which solution allows the engineer to block the execution stage and prevent file encryption?
A. Use Cisco AMP deployment with the Exploit Prevention engine enabled
B. Use Cisco Firepower with Intrusion Policy and snort rules blocking SMB
exploitation
C. Use Cisco AMP deployment with the Malicious Activity Protection engineer enabled
D. Use Cisco Firepower and block traffic to TOR networks 

Answer: C

Explanation
Ransomware are malicious software that locks up critical resources of the users. Ransomware uses well-established public/private key cryptography which leaves the only way of recovering the files being the payment of the ransom, or restoring files from backups.
Cisco Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) for Endpoints Malicious Activity Protection (MAP) engine defends your endpoints by monitoring the system and identifying processes that exhibit malicious activities when they execute and stops them from running. Because the MAP engine detects threats by observing the behavior of the process at run time, it can generically determine if a system is under attack by a new variant of ransomware or malware that may have eluded other security products and detection technology, such as legacy signature-based malware detection. The first release of the MAP engine targets identification, blocking, and quarantine of ransomware attacks on the endpoint.

Question 30 - Checked
Wireless users report frequent disconnections from the wireless network. While troubleshooting a network engineer finds that after the user a disconnect, the connection reestablishes automatically without any input required. The engineer also notices these message logs.

AP ‘AP2’ is down Reason: Radio channel set. 6:54:04 PM 
AP ‘AP4’ is down Reason: Radio channel set. 6:44:49 PM 
AP ‘AP7’ is down Reason: Radio channel set. 6:34:32 PM
  
Which action reduces the user impact?
A. increase BandSelect
B. enable coverage hole detection
C. increase the AP heartbeat timeout
D. increase the dynamic channel assignment interval

Answer: D

Explanation
These message logs inform that the radio channel has been reset (and the AP must be down briefly). With dynamic channel assignment (DCA), the radios can frequently switch from one channel to another but it also makes disruption. The default DCA interval is 10 minutes, which is matched with the time of the message logs. By increasing the DCA interval, we can reduce the number of times our users are disconnected for changing radio channels.

Question 2 - Checked
What is calculated using the numerical values of the transmitter power level, cable loss and antenna gain?
A. SNR
B. RSSI
C. dBi
D. EIRP

Answer: D

Explanation
Once you know the complete combination of transmitter power level, the length of cable, and the antenna gain, you can figure out the actual power level that will be radiated from the antenna. This is known as the effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP), measured in dBm.
EIRP is a very important parameter because it is regulated by governmental agencies in most countries. In those cases, a system cannot radiate signals higher than a maximum allowable EIRP. To find the EIRP of a system, simply add the transmitter power level to the antenna gain and subtract the cable loss.
EIRP = Tx Power – Tx Cable + Tx Antenna
Suppose a transmitter is configured for a power level of 10 dBm (10 mW). answer 'SNR' cable with 5-dB loss connects the transmitter to an antenna with an 8-dBi gain. The resulting EIRP of the system is 10 dBm – 5 dB + 8 dBi, or 13 dBm.
You might notice that the EIRP is made up of decibel-milliwatt (dBm), dB relative to an isotropic antenna (dBi), and decibel (dB) values. Even though the units appear to be differrent, you can safely combine them because they are all in the dB “domain”.

Question 3
A network engineer has to decide between a Layer 2 Access Layer (STP-based) and a Layer 3 Access Layer (Routed access) campus design option. Which statement must be considered for a decision to be made?
A. The STP based option does not require FHRP, whereas the Routed access option does.
B. The Routed access option offers easier troubleshooting than the STP-based option.
C. The STP based access option supports spanning VLANs across multiple access switches, whereas the Routed access option does not.
D. The Routed access option is the best cost-effective solution.

Answer: B

Explanation: The Routed access design has a number of advantages over the STP-based design:
No FHRP required – no need for FHRP protocols such as HSRP and VRRP.
No STP required – since there are no L2 links to block, this design removes the need for STP.
Easier troubleshooting – It offers common end-to-end troubleshooting tools (such as ping and traceroute).
The Routed access is an excellent design for many environments, but it has the same limitation as the STP-based design, in which it does not support spanning VLANs across multiple access switches. Additionally, it might not be the most cost-effective solution because access layer switches with Layer 3 routing capability might cost more than Layer 2 switches do.

Question 4 - Checked
Which three functions are performed at the distribution layer of the hierarchical network model? (Choose three.)
A. isolates network problems to prevent them from affecting the core layer
B. provides a connection point for separate local networks
C. forwards traffic that is destined for other networks
D. allows end users to access the local network
E. transports large amounts of data between different geographic sites
F. forwards traffic to other hosts on the same logical network

Answer: ABC

Explanation: The primary function of the distribution layer is to aggregate access layer switches in a given building or campus. The distribution layer provides a boundary between the Layer 2 domain of the access layer and the Layer 3 domain of the core. On the Layer 2 side, it creates a boundary for Spanning Tree Protocol (STP), limiting propagation of Layer 2 faults. On the Layer 3 side, it provides a logical point to summarize IP routing information when it enters the core Layer. The summarization reduces IP route tables for easier troubleshooting and reduces protocol overhead for faster recovery from failures.

What two factors are used to achieve end-to-end QoS in the DiffServ model? (Choose two.)
A. DSCP
B. PHB
C. PCP
D. DEI
E. VLAN ID

Answer: AB

Explanation: IIn order to deliver end-to-end QoS, DiffServ architecture has two major components, packet marking using the IPv4 ToS byte and PHBs. The Differentiated Services (DS) field uses 6 bits to classify packets. DSCP uses the leftmost six bits from the ToS byte in the IPv4 header to specify class of service for each IP packet to form the DiffServ (DS) field. With 6 bits, DSCP has up to 64 DSCP values (0 to 63) that are assigned to various classes of traffic. These selective values are called per-hop behaviors (PHB) and determine how packets are treated at each hop along the path from the source to the destination.

C. It is an architecture created to address routing scalability problems.
D. It provides a permanent control plane connection over a DTLS tunnel.
E. It authenticates vSmart controllers and SD-WAN routers.

Answer: AC

Explanation: Locator/Identifier Separation Protocol (LISP) is used by Internet providers, data centers, branch networks, and campus networks to address routing scalability problems and provide an overlay tunneling technology. LIST separates IP addresses into endpoint identifiers (EID) and routing locators (RLOCs) so endpoints can roam from site to site with only the RLOC changing. An egress tunnel router (ETR), ingress tunnel router (ITR), proxy ETR, proxy ITR, or xTR, a device that is both an ETR and an ITR, are used to connect LISP and non-LISP sites in a variety of ways.

Question 17 - Checked
A teacher is explaining the concept of virtual switch (vSwitch) to students in a classroom. What explannation accurately describe a vSwitch?
A. A vSwitch is a software-based Layer 3 switch that operates like a physical switch.
B. Multiple vSwitches can be created under a virtualized server, allowing network traffic to flow directly from one vSwitch to another within the same host.
C. A vSwitch is a cluster of switches forming a virtual switching system (VSS).
D. A vSwitch enables VMs to communicate with external physical networks through physical network interface cards.

Answer: D

Explanation: A virtual switch (vSwitch) is a software-based Layer 2 switch that operates like a physical Ethernet switch. A vSwitch enables VMs to communicate with each other within a virtualized server and with external physical networks through the physical network interface cards (pNICs.) Multiple vSwitches can be created under a virtualized server, but network traffic cannot flow directly from one vSwitch to another vSwitch within the same host, and the vSwitches cannot share the same pNIC.

What are two characteristics of virtual routing that are different from traditional routing? (Choose two.)
A. VRF allows for overlapping IP address ranges.
B. VRF requires the use of the BGP routing protocol.
C. VRF requires creating subinterfaces if VRF is to be enabled.
D. Each VRF instance has its own routing table.
E. VRF takes advantages of Layer 2 technologies such as spanning tree.

Answer: AD

Explanation: Virtual routing and forwarding (VRF) is a Layer 3 technology used to create separate virtual routers on a physical router. Each VRF instance has associated router interface(s) or subinterface(s), routing table, and forwarding table. Overlapping and even duplicate IP addresses can be used when using VRF because VRF creates segmentation between the interfaces, IP addresses, and routing tables.

Question 19 - Checked
What is a key difference between a virtual machine and a virtualized container?
A. A virtual machine starts much faster than a virtualized container does.
B. A virtual machine uses physical memory to run and a virtualized container uses virtualized memory.
C. A virtual machine requires a type 1 hypervisor and a virtualized container requires a type 2 hypervisor.
D. A virtual machine contains its own OS and a virtualized container does not.

Answer: D

Explanation: A virtual machine (VM) is a software emulation of a physical server with an operating system. A container is an isolated environment where containerized applications run. Containers all share the same OS while remaining isolated from each other. They all use virtualized memory managed by the hypervisor. Because a container does not have a guest OS, it relies on the host operating system to provide underlying services. It typically takes a few seconds to start.

Question 20
A network engineer wants to increase the overall efficiency and cost-effectiveness of a server by maximizing the use of available resources through virtualization. The engineer is considering VMs or containers. What is the difference between these two types of virtualization?
A. VMs take minutes to start, whereas containers take seconds to start.
B. VMs do not include a guest OS, whereas containers do.
C. VMs require a type 1 hypervisor directly on the system hardware, whereas containers require a type 2 hypervisor.
D. VMs share the same operating system, whereas each container requires a dedicated operating system.

Answer: A

Explanation: Each VM on a server has an dedicated OS and all containers on a server share the host OS while remaining isolated from each other. A VM contains a guest OS. Containers do not contain one, so they are lightweight (small in size). When a VM starts, the guest OS needs to load first, and once it is operational, the application in the VM can then start and run. This whole process may take minutes. When a container starts, it leverages the kernel of the host OS, which is already running, and it typically takes a few seconds to start.

A network administrator is verifying the bridge ID and the status of this switch in the STP election. Which statement is correct based on the command output?
A. The bridge priority of Switch_2 has been lowered to a predefined value to become the backup root bridge.
B. The bridge priority of Switch_2 has been lowered to a predefined value to become the root bridge.
C. The STP instance on Switch_2 is using the default STP priority and the election is based on Switch_2 MAC address.
D. The STP instance on Switch_2 is failing due to no ports being blocked and all switches believing they are the root.

Answer: B

Explanation: The priority value 24576 is a predefined value that is implemented by the command spanning-tree vlan 10 root primary . This command configures Switch_2 to become the root switch. A root switch will have all forwarding interfaces and no root ports.

D. it leverages the kernel of the host OS for quick starts
E. it is a virtualized physical server
F. it requires a hypervisor

Answer: BEF

Explanation: A virtual machine is a software emulation of a physical server including a CPU, memory, network interface, and operating system. The hypervisor is virtualization software that performs hardware abstraction. It allows multiple VMs to run concurrently in the virtual environment.

Question 23
What is a characteristic of the PortFast feature?
A. PortFast enables a Cisco Catalyst switch to move a port into blocking state when an attached workstation link comes up.
B. A trunk port can be configured with PortFast if it connects to a hypervisor host.
C. PortFast can only be used for STP host ports.
D. PortFast prevents alternative ports from becoming designated ports.

Answer: B

Explanation: One of the major benefits of the STP PortFast feature is that the access ports bypass the earlier 802.1D STP states (learning and listening) and forward traffic immediately. PortFast can be enabled on trunk links, but only with ports that are connecting to a single host, such as a server with only one NIC that is running a hypervisor with VMs on different VLANs.

Question 27 - Checked
What are two drawbacks to turning spanning tree off and having multiple paths through the Layer 2 switch network? (Choose two.)
A. Port security shuts down all of the ports that have attached devices.
B. Broadcast frames are transmitted indefinitely.
C. The MAC address table becomes unstable.
D. Port security becomes unstable.
E. The switch acts like a hub.

Answer: BC

Explanation: Spanning tree should never be disabled. Without it, the MAC address table becomes unstable, broadcast storms can render network clients and the switches unusable, and multiple copies of unicast frames can be delivered to the end devices.

Question 28 - Checked
Network users complain that the network is running very slowly. Upon investigation, a network technician discovers 100% link utilization on all the network devices. Also, numerous syslog messages are being generated that note continuous MAC address relearning. What is the most likely cause of the problem?
A. The routing protocol has been misconfigured and a routing loop is evident.
B. A Layer 2 STP looping condition is present.
C. The dynamic routing protocol has not yet converged the network.
D. An incorrect encapsulation has been configured on one of the trunks that connect a Layer 2 device to a Layer 3 device within the affected segment.
E. Keepalives are expected but do not arrive.

Answer: B

Explanation: High CPU consumption and low free memory space are common symptoms of a Layer 2 forwarding loop. In Layer 2 forwarding loops, besides constantly consuming switch bandwidth, the CPU spikes as well. As the packet is received on a different interface, the switch must move the MAC address from one interface to the next. The network throughput is impacted drastically, users will probably notice a slow-down on their network applications, and the switches might crash because of an exhausted CPU and low memory resources.

SW1 is the root bridge and SW2 is the backup root bridge. An administrator wants to prevent SW4 and SW5 from ever becoming root bridges, but still allow SW2 to maintain connectivity to SW1 via SW3 if the link connecting SW1 to SW2 fails. On which two ports in this topology should the administrator configure root guard to accomplish this? (Choose two.)
A. SW5 Gi0/3 port toward SW3
B. SW2 Gi0/4 port toward SW4
C. SW3 Gi0/5 port toward SW5
D. SW4 Gi0/6 port toward SW5
E. SW4 Gi0/2 port toward SW2

Answer: BC

Explanation: Root guard is an STP feature that is enabled on a port-by-port basis. It prevents a configured port from becoming a root port. Root guard prevents a downstream switch from becoming a root bridge in a topology. Root guard is placed on designated ports toward other switches that should never become root bridges. In order to prevent SW4 and SW5 from becoming root bridges, root guard has to be placed on SW2 Gi0/4 port toward SW4 and on SW3 Gi0/5 port toward SW5.

A network administrator has connected two switches together using EtherChannel technology. If STP is running, what will be the end result?
A. The resulting loop will create a broadcast storm.
B. The switches will load balance and utilize both EtherChannels to forward packets.
C. Both port channels will shutdown.
D. STP will block one of the redundant links.

Answer: D

Explanation: Cisco switches support two protocols for negotiating a channel between two switches: LACP and PAgP. PAgP is Cisco-proprietary. In the topology shown, the switches are connected to each other using redundant links. By default, STP is enabled on switch devices. STP will block redundant links to prevent loops.

A company is deploying a wireless network using lightweight APs. What is an advantage of Layer 2 roaming compared with Layer 3 roaming when wireless clients roam around the campus?
A. The process of Layer 2 roaming is faster.
B. A wireless client can keep the same IP address.
C. The roaming does not involve a WLC.
D. DHCP service is not required.

Answer: A

Explanation
Both Layer 2 and Layer 3 roams are intercontroller roaming. In intercontroller roaming, a client roams from one AP to another AP that is bound to a different WLC. If both APs are configured with the same VLAN and IP address subnet, the client has made a Layer 2 intercontroller roam and it stays on the same VLAN and subnet. The process of Layer 2 roaming is faster than Layer 3 roaming (usually less than 20 ms). Both Layer 2 roaming and Layer 3 roaming allow the client to keep the same IP address.

C. to capture network traffic on a remote device and send it to the local system through Layer 3 toward a local port attached to a traffic analyzer
D. to capture local network traffic on a switch and send a copy of it to a local port attached to a traffic analyzer

Answer: C

Explanation
Catalyst switches provide the Switched Port Analyzer (SPAN), which makes it possible to capture packets by using the following techniques:
Local Switched Port Analyzer. Local network traffic is captured on a switch and a copy of it is sent to a local port attached to a traffic analyzer.
Remote Switched Port Analyzer (RSPAN). Network traffic is captured on a remote switch and a copy of it is sent to the local switch through Layer 2 (switching) toward a local port attached to a traffic analyzer.
Encapsulated Remote Switched Port Analyzer (ERSPAN). Network traffic is captured on a remote device and it is sent to the local system through Layer 3 (routing) toward a local port attached to a traffic analyzer.

D. The switch will initiate authentication by MAB protocol. If it fails, the switch will try 802.1x next, then WebAuth.

Answer: C

Explanation
When an organization deploys network access control, MAB and WebAuth can be used as a fallback authentication mechanism for 802.1x. If both MAB and WebAuth are configured as fallbacks for 802.1x, when 802.1x times out, a switch first attempts to authenticate through MAB, and if it fails, the switch attempts to authenticate with WebAuth.

BGP sessions are established between all routers. RTC receives route updates for network 209.165.200.224/27 from autonomous system 300 with the weight attribute set to 3000. RTB also learns about network 209.165.200.224/27 from autonomous system 200 with a weight of 2000. Which router will be used by RTA as a next hop to reach this network?
A. RTC because of the T1 link
B. RTB because of the slow 64 kbps link
C. RTB because of the shortest AS_Path
D. RTC because of the highest weight
E. RTC because of the longest AS_Path
F. RTB because of the lowest weight

Answer: C

Explanation
The BGP best-path algorithm uses attributes for the best-path selection. The top 5 attributes, ranked in order of consideration, are the following:
1. Weight.
2. Local preference.
3. Local originated (network statement, redistribution, or aggregation).
4. AIGP.
5. Shortest AS_Path.
BGP weight is a Cisco-defined attribute and is a 16-bit value assigned locally on the router; it is not advertised to other routers. Thus, the weight attributes as specified in RTD and RTE have no effect in RTA for determining the best outbound path. Assuming that the attributes in ranks 2 to 4 are not specified, the shortest AS_Path attribute is used to choose the outbound path when two paths are available.

A company plans to deploy the Postman application as a tool to manage network devices. Which two security related best practices should be considered? (Choose two.)
A. An SSH connection should be used to connect to the Postman application.
B. User accesses must be authenticated to make API calls.
C. A dedicated instance for development should be used to ensure that device configurations are valid.
D. AAA service should be deployed for user authorization.
E. ACLs should be used to verify and filter different types of RUSTFul API calls.

Answer: BC

Explanation
RESTful APIs are software interfaces into an application or a controller. For security considerations, access to APIs should require authentication such that an API is considered just like any other device to which a user needs to authenticate to gain access to utilize the APIs. A developer who is authenticated has access to making changes using the API, changes that can affect that application. It is best practice to use a dedicated development instance of the application to test change codes to avoid accidental impact to a production environment.

What is a requirement to configure a trunking EtherChannel between two switches?
A. The participating interfaces must be on the same module on a switch.
B. The allowed range of VLANs must be the same on both switches.
C. The participating interfaces must be assigned the same VLAN number on both switches.
D. The participating interfaces must be physically contiguous on a switch.

Answer: B

Explanation
To enable a trunking EtherChannel successfully, the range of VLANs allowed on all the interfaces must match; otherwise, the EtherChannel cannot be formed. The interfaces involved in an EtherChannel do not have to be physically contiguous, or on the same module. Because the EtherChannel is a trunking one, participating interfaces are configured as trunk mode, not access mode.

Router# show flow interface

FastEthernet 0/0
Ip flow ingress

The total number of packet flows is not consistent with what is expected by the network administrator. The results show only half of the flows that are typically captured for the interface. Pings between the router and the collector are successful. What is the reason for the unexpected results?
A. Interface Fa0/0 is not configured as the source of the packets sent to the collector.
B. The interface is shutdown.
C. The Netflow collector IP address and UDP port number are not configured on the router.
D. The router is not configured to monitor outgoing packets on the interface.

A. SPAN can send a copy of traffic to a port on another switch.
B. SPAN can be configured to send a copy of traffic to a destination port on the same switch.
C. RSPAN is required to copy traffic on a source VLAN to a destination port on the same switch.
D. RSPAN can be used to forward traffic to reach an IPS that is analyzing traffic for malicious behavior.
E. RSPAN is required for syslog and SNMP implementation.
F. SPAN can copy traffic on a source port or source VLAN to a destination port on the same switch.

Answer: BDF

Explanation
The Switched Port Analyzer (SPAN) feature on Cisco switches is a type of port mirroring that sends copies of the frame entering a source port (or VLAN), out another port on the same switch. Typically the destination port is attached with a packet sniffer or IPS device. Remote SPAN (RSPAN) allows source and destination ports to be in different switches.

Question 67
A large shopping mall is planning to deploy a wireless network for customers. The network will use a lightweight AP topology. The network designers are considering the roaming by wireless clients. Which statement describes a difference between Layer 2 roaming and Layer 3 roaming?
A. Layer 2 roaming occurs between two APs configured with the same VLAN and IP subnet, whereas Layer 3 roaming occurs between two APs configured with different VLANs and IP subnets.
B. Layer 2 roaming does not require the client to contact a DHCP server, whereas Layer 3 roaming requires the client to contact a DHCP server.
C. Layer 2 roaming does not require communicating to a WLC through CAPWAP, whereas Layer 3 roaming does.
D. Layer 2 roaming occurs between two APs that are bound to the same WLC, whereas Layer 3 roaming occurs between two APs that are bound to different WLCs.

Answer: A

Explanation
Both Layer 2 and Layer 3 roams are intercontroller roaming. In intercontroller roaming, a client roams from one AP to another AP that is bound to a different WLC. An AP communicates to the bounding WLC through a CAPWAP tunnel. If the two APs involved in an intercontroller roaming are configured with the same VLAN and IP subnet, Layer 2 roaming occurs. If they are configured with different VLANs and IP subnets, a Layer 3 roaming occurs.

A. authen-radius
B. LetMe1n2
C. Pa$$w0rD
D. authen-tacacs

Answer: C

Explanation
The authentication for Telnet connections is defined by AAA method list AUTHEN. The AUTHEN list defines that the first authentication method is through an ACS server using the RADIUS protocol (or RADIUS server). If the RADIUS server cannot be contacted, the second authentication method is to use the local user database. In this scenario, the local user database is used with a username of ADMIN and a password of Pa$$w0rD.

Question 79
What is the one major difference between local AAA authentication and using the login local command when configuring device access authentication?
A. The login local command requires the administrator to manually configure the usernames and passwords, but local AAA authentication does not.
B. Local AAA authentication allows more than one user account to be configured, but login local does not.
C. Local AAA authentication provides a way to configure backup methods of authentication, but login local does not.
D. The login local command uses local usernames and passwords stored on the router, but local AAA authentication does not.

Answer: C

Explanation
Local AAA authentication works very similar to the login local command, except that it allows you to specify backup authentication methods as well. Both methods require that local usernames and passwords be manually configured on the router.

C. Telnet connections from the 192.168.2.0/24 network to the 192.168.1.0/24 network are allowed.
D. SSH connections from the 192.168.1.0/24 network to the 192.168.2.0/24 network are blocked.
E. Telnet connections from the 192.168.1.0/24 network to the 192.168.2.0/24 network are blocked.
F. Telnet connections from the 192.168.1.0/24 network to the 192.168.2.0/24 network are allowed.

Answer: BE

Explanation
The extended access list in the exhibit is permitting SSH (TCP port 22) traffic that is sourced from the 192.168.1.0/24 network and traveling to the 192.168.2.0/24 network. The packets meeting this criteria are logged to the local logging buffer (the default), a syslog server, or both depending on how the router is configured for syslog settings. All other traffic is denied because of the implicit deny at the end of every ACL.

Question 81
Consider the configured access list.

R1# show access-lists
extended IP access list 100
deny tcp host 10.1.1.2 host 10.1.1.1 eq telnet
deny tcp host 10.1.2.2 host 10.1.2.1 eq telnet
permit ip any any (15 matches)

What are two characteristics of this access list? (Choose two.)
A. The 10.1.2.1 device is not allowed to telnet to the 10.1.2.2 device.
B. The access list has been applied to an interface.
C. Any device can telnet to the 10.1.2.1 device.
D. A network administrator would not be able to tell if the access list has been applied to an interface or not.
E. Only the 10.1.1.2 device can telnet to the router that has the 10.1.1.1 IP address assigned.
F. Any device on the 10.1.1.0/24 network (except the 10.1.1.2 device) can telnet to the router that has the IP address 10.1.1.1 assigned.

Answer: BF

Explanation: The access list stops Telnet traffic from the 10.1.1.2 device to the 10.1.1.1 device. It also stops Telnet traffic from 10.1.2.2 device to 10.1.2.1. All other TCP/IP-based transmissions are allowed. The access list is working because there have been 15 matches on the last ACE.

S4 Priority = 36864, MAC = 000A00111110

Spanning-tree port priorities are listed beneath each interface. The network administrator enters the spanning-tree vlan 1 root primary command on S4. What is the effect of the command?
A. Port priority makes Gi0/2 on S1 a root port.
B. S3 Gi0/2 transitions from designated port to root port because of path cost changes caused by the root change.
Spanning tree blocks Gi0/1 on S3 to prevent a redundant path from S1.
C. S4 is already the root bridge, so there are no port changes.
D. S2 Gi0/1 becomes a nondesignated port because Gi0/2 has a lower path cost to S4.

Answer: B

Explanation
According to the exhibit, S1 is the root bridge. After the spanning-tree vlan 1 root primary command on S4 is issued, S4 becomes the root bridge, because S4 priority is modified to 24576 and the MAC address is lower than the MAC address of S1. This causes S3 Gi0/2 port to transition from designated port to root port because of path cost changes caused by this root change.

A network administrator is configuring an EtherChannel link between two switches, SW1 and SW2. Which statement describes the effect after the commands are issued on SW1 and SW2?
A. The EtherChannel is established after SW2 initiates the link request.
B. The EtherChannel is established after SW1 initiates the link request.
C. The EtherChannel is established without negotiation.
D. The EtherChannel fails to establish.

Answer: D

Explanation
The interfaces GigabitEthernet 0/1 and GigabitEthernet 0/2 are configured “on” for the EtherChannel link. This mode forces the interface to channel without PAgP or LACP. The EtherChannel will be established only if the other side is also set to “on”. However, the mode on SW2 side is set to PAgP desirable. Thus the EtherChannel link will not be established.

What does the LAP send when multiple WLCs respond to the CISCO-CAPWAP-CONTROLLER.localdomain hostname during the CAPWAP discovery and join process?
A. unicast discovery request to the first WLC that resolves the domain name
B. broadcast discovery request
C. join request to all the WLCs
D. unicast discovery request to each WLC

Answer: D

Explanation
The Lightweight AP (LAP) can discover controllers through your domain name server (DNS). For the access point (AP) to do so, you must configure your DNS to return controller IP addresses in response to CISCO-LWAPP-CONTROLLER.localdomain, where localdomain is the AP domain name. When an AP receives an IP address and DNS information from a DHCP server, it contacts the DNS to resolve CISCO-CAPWAP-CONTROLLER.localdomain. When the DNS sends a list of controller IP addresses, the AP sends discovery requests to the controllers.
The AP will attempt to resolve the DNS name CISCO-CAPWAP-CONTROLLER.localdomain. When the AP is able to resolve this name to one or more IP addresses, the AP sends a unicast CAPWAP Discovery Message to the resolved IP address(es). Each WLC that receives the CAPWAP Discovery Request Message replies with a unicast CAPWAP Discovery Response to the AP.

Which of the following relate to traffic policing? (Choose three)
A. drops excessive traffic
B. buffers excessive traffic
C. introduces no delay and jitter
D. causes TCP retransmission when traffic is dropped
E. typically delays, rather than drops traffic
F. introduces delay and jitter

Answer: ACD

Explanation
Policers for incoming traffic are most optimally deployed at the edge of the network to keep traffic from wasting valuable bandwidth in the core of the network. Policers for outbound traffic are most optimally deployed at the edge of the network or core-facing interfaces on network edge devices. A downside
of policing is that it causes TCP retransmissions when it drops traffic.
Shapers are used for egress traffic and typically deployed by enterprise networks on service provider (SP)–facing interfaces. Shaping is useful in cases where SPs are policing incoming traffic or when SPs are not policing traffic but do have a maximum traffic rate SLA, which, if violated, could incur monetary penalties. Shaping buffers and delays traffic rather than dropping it, and this causes fewer TCP retransmissions compared to policing.

A. It accepts LISP encapsulated map requests
B. It learns of EID prefix mapping entries from an ETR
C. It receives traffic from LISP sites and sends it to non-LISP sites
D. It receives packets from site-facing interfaces

Answer: C

Explanation
ETR is the function that receives LISP encapsulated packets, decapsulates them and forwards to its local EIDs.This function also requires EID-to-RLOC mappings so we need to point out an “map-server” IP address and the key (password) for authentication.
A LISP proxy ETR (PETR) implements ETR functions on behalf of non-LISP sites. A PETR is typically used when a LISP site needs to send traffic to non-LISP sites but the LISP site is connected through a service provider that does not accept nonroutable EIDs as packet sources. PETRs act just like ETRs but for EIDs that send traffic to destinations at non-LISP sites.

C. It receives traffic from LISP sites and sends it to non-LISP sites
D. It receives packets from site-facing interfaces

Answer: D

Explanation
ITR is the function that maps the destination EID to a destination RLOC and then encapsulates the original packet with an additional header that has the source IP address of the ITR RLOC and the destination IP address of the RLOC of an Egress Tunnel Router (ETR). After the encapsulation, the original packet become a LISP packet.
ETR is the function that receives LISP encapsulated packets, decapsulates them and forwards to its local EIDs.This function also requires EID-to-RLOC mappings so we need to point out an “map-server” IP address and the key (password) for authentication.

Which access point mode allows a supported AP to function like a WLAN client would, associating and identifying client connectivity issues?
A. client mode
B. SE-connect mode
C. sensor mode
D. sniffer mode

Answer: C

Explanation
Monitor: The AP does not transmit at all, but its receiver is enabled to act as a dedicated sensor. The AP checks for IDS events, detects rogue access points, and determines the position of stations through location-based services.
Sniffer: An AP dedicates its radios to receiving 802.11 traffic from other sources, much like a sniffer or packet capture device. The captured traffic is then forwarded to a PC running network analyzer software such as LiveAction Omnipeek or Wireshark, where it can be analyzed further.
SE-Connect: The AP dedicates its radios to spectrum analysis on all wireless channels. You can remotely connect a PC running software such as MetaGeek Chanalyzer or Cisco Spectrum Expert to the AP to collect and analyze the spectrum analysis data to discover sources of interference.

We cannot filter traffic that is originated from the local router (R3 in this case) so we can only configure the ACL on R1 or R2. “Weekend hours” means from Saturday morning through Sunday night so we have to configure: “periodic weekend 00:00 to 23:59”.
Note: The time is specified in 24-hour time (hh:mm), where the hours range from 0 to 23 and the minutes range from 0 to 59.

Which tool is used in Cisco DNA Center to build generic configurations that are able to be applied on devices with similar network settings?
A. Command Runner
B. Application Policies
C. Template Editor
D. Authentication Template

Answer: C

Explanation
Cisco DNA Center provides an interactive editor called Template Editor to author CLI templates. Template Editor is a centralized CLI management tool to help design a set of device configurations that you need to build devices in a branch. When you have a site, office, or branch that uses a similar set of devices and configurations, you can use Template Editor to build generic configurations and apply the configurations to one or more devices in the branch.

A network engineer is configuring OSPF between router R1 and router R2. The engineer must ensure that a DR/BDR election does not occur on the Gigabit Ethernet interfaces in area 0.
Which configuration set accomplishes this goal?
A. R1(config-if)interface Gi0/0
R1(config-if)ip ospf network point-to-point
R2(config-if)interface Gi0/0
R2(config-if)ip ospf network point-to-point

D. R1(config-if)interface Gi0/0 
R1(config-if)ip ospf priority 1
R2(config-if)interface Gi0/0
R2(config-if)ip ospf priority 1

Answer: A

Explanation
Broadcast and Non-Broadcast networks elect DR/BDR while Point-to-point/multipoint do not elect DR/BDR. Therefore we have to set the two Gi0/0 interfaces to point-to-point or point-to-multipoint network to ensure that a DR/BDR election does not occur.

service-policy input CoPP_SSH !
ip access-list extended CoPP_SSH permit tcp any any eq 22
!

Answer: C

Explanation
CoPP protects the route processor on network devices by treating route processor resources as a separate entity with its own ingress interface (and in some implementations, egress also). CoPP is used to police traffic that is destined to the route processor of the router such as:
+ Routing protocols like OSPF, EIGRP, or BGP.
+ Gateway redundancy protocols like HSRP, VRRP, or GLBP.
+ Network management protocols like telnet, SSH, SNMP, or RADIUS.

 Therefore we must apply the CoPP to deal with SSH because it is in the management plane. CoPP must be put under “control-plane” command. But we cannot name the control-plane (like "transit").

Question 32
A client device roams between access points located on different floors in an atrium. The access points are joined to the same controller and configured in local mode. The access points are in different AP groups and have different IP addresses, but the client VLAN in the groups is the same.
What type of roam occurs?
A. inter-controller
B. inter-subnet
C. intra-VLAN
D. intra-controller

Answer: D

Explanation
Three popular types of client roaming are:
Intra-Controller Roaming: Each controller supports same-controller client roaming across access points managed by the same controller. This roaming is transparent to the client as the session is sustained, and the client continues using the same DHCP-assigned or client-assigned IP address.
Inter-Controller Roaming: Multiple-controller deployments support client roaming across access points managed by controllers in the same mobility group and on the same subnet. This roaming is also transparent to the client because the session is sustained and a tunnel between controllers allows the client to continue using the same DHCP- or client-assigned IP address as long as the session remains active.
Inter-Subnet Roaming: Multiple-controller deployments support client roaming across access points managed by controllers in the same mobility group on different subnets. This roaming is transparent to the client because the session is sustained and a tunnel between the controllers allows the client to continue using the same DHCP-assigned or client-assigned IP address as long as the session remains active.

Question 33 - Checked
Which component handles the orchestration plane of the Cisco SD-WAN?
A. vBond
B. vSmart
C. vManage
D. vEdge

Answer: A

Explanation
+ Orchestration plane (vBond) assists in securely onboarding the SD-WAN WAN Edge routers into the SD-WAN overlay. The vBond controller, or orchestrator, authenticates and authorizes the SD-WAN components onto the network. The vBond orchestrator takes an added responsibility to distribute the list of vSmart and vManage controller information to the WAN Edge routers. vBond is the only device in SD-WAN that requires a public IP address as it is the first point of contact and authentication for all SD-WAN components to join the SD-WAN fabric. All other components need to know the vBond IP or DNS information.

Question 35 - Checked
An engineer is describing QoS to a client.
Which two facts apply to traffic policing? (Choose two.)
A. Policing should be performed as close to the source as possible.
B. Policing adapts to network congestion by queuing excess traffic.
C. Policing should be performed as close to the destination as possible.
D. Policing drops traffic that exceeds the defined rate.
E. Policing typically delays the traffic, rather than drops it.

Answer: AD

Explanation
Traffic policing propagates bursts. When the traffic rate reaches the configured maximum rate (or committed information rate), excess traffic is dropped (or remarked). The result is an output rate that appears as a saw-tooth with crests and troughs.
Unlike traffic shaping, traffic policing does not cause delay.
Classification (which includes traffic policing, traffic shaping and queuing techniques) should take place at the network edge. It is recommended that classification occur as close to the source of the traffic as possible.
Also according to this Cisco link, “policing traffic as close to the source as possible”.

How does QoS traffic shaping alleviate network congestion?
A. It drops packets when traffic exceeds a certain bitrate.
B. It buffers and queues packets above the committed rate.
C. It fragments large packets and queues them for delivery.
D. It drops packets randomly from lower priority queues.

Answer: B

Explanation
Traffic shaping retains excess packets in a queue and then schedules the excess for later transmission over increments of time. The result of traffic shaping is a smoothed packet output rate.

What is the difference between the enable password and the enable secret password when service password encryption is enabled on an IOS device?
A. The enable secret password is protected via stronger cryptography mechanisms.
B. The enable password cannot be decrypted.
C. The enable password is encrypted with a stronger encryption method.
D. There is no difference and both passwords are encrypted identically.

Answer: A

Explanation
The “enable secret” password is always encrypted (independent of the “service passwordencryption” command) using MD5 hash algorithm. The “enable password” does not encrypt the password and can be view in clear text in the running-config. In order to encrypt the “enable password”, use the “service password-encryption” command. This command will encrypt the passwords by using the Vigenere encryption algorithm. Unfortunately, the Vigenere encryption method is cryptographically weak and trivial to reverse.
The MD5 hash is a stronger algorithm than Vigenere so answer ‘The enable secret password is protected via stronger cryptography mechanisms’ is correct.

The Lightweight AP (LAP) can discover controllers through your domain name server (DNS). For the access point (AP) todo so, you must configure your DNS to return controller IP addresses in response to CISCO-LWAPP-CONTROLLER.localdomain, where localdomain is the AP domain name. When an AP receives an IP address and DNSinformation from a DHCP server, it contacts the DNS to resolve CISCOCAPWAP-CONTROLLER.localdomain. When theDNS sends a list of controller IP addresses, the AP sends discovery requests to the controllers.
The AP will attempt to resolve the DNS name CISCO-CAPWAP-CONTROLLER.localdomain. When the AP is able toresolve this name to one or more IP addresses, the AP sends a unicast CAPWAP Discovery Message to the resolved IPaddress(es). Each WLC that receives the CAPWAP Discovery Request Message replies with a unicast CAPWAP DiscoveryResponse to the AP.

Question 74
Which TCP setting is tuned to minimize the risk of fragmentation on a GRE/IP tunnel?
A. MSS
B. MTU
C. MRU
D. window size

Answer: A

Explanation
The TCP Maximum Segment Size (TCP MSS) defines the maximum amount of data that a host is willing to accept in a single TCP/IP datagram. This TCP/IP datagram might be fragmented at the IP layer. The MSS value is sent as a TCP header option only in TCP SYN segments. Each side of a TCP connection reports its MSS value to the other side. Contrary to popular belief, the MSS value is not negotiated between hosts. The sending host is required to limit the size of data in a single TCP segment to a value less than or equal to the MSS reported by the receiving host.
TCP MSS takes care of fragmentation at the two endpoints of a TCP connection, but it does not handle the case where there is a smaller MTU link in the middle between these two endpoints. PMTUD was developed in order to avoid fragmentation in the path between the endpoints. It is used to dynamically determine the lowest MTU along the path from a packet’s source to its destination.

What is a fact about Cisco EAP-FAST?
A. It requires a client certificate.
B. It is an IETF standard.
C. It does not require a RADIUS server certificate.
D. It operates in transparent mode.

Answer: C

Explanation
The EAP-FAST protocol is a publicly accessible IEEE 802.1X EAP type that Cisco developed to support customers that cannot enforce a strong password policy and want to deploy an 802.1X EAP type that does not require digital certificates.
EAP-FAST is also designed for simplicity of deployment since it does not require a certificate on the wireless LAN client or on the RADIUS infrastructure yet incorporates a built-in provisioning mechanism.

How do agent-based versus agentless configuration management tools compare?
A. Agentless tools use proxy nodes to interface with slave nodes.
B. Agentless tools require no messaging systems between master and slaves.
C. Agent-based tools do not require a high-level language interpreter such as Python or Ruby on slave nodes.
D. Agent-based tools do not require installation of additional software packages on the slave nodes.

Answer: B

Explanation
Agentless tool means that no software or agent needs to be installed on the client machines that are to be managed. Ansible is such an agentless tool. In contrast to agentless tool, agent-based tool requires software or agent to be installed on the client. Therefore the master and slave nodes can communicate directly without the need of high-level language interpreter.
An agentless tool uses standard protocols, such as SSH, to push configurations down to a device (and it can be considered a “messaging system”).

Which statement about TLS is true when using RESTCONF to write configurations on network devices?
A. It is used for HTTP and HTTPS requests.
B. It requires certificates for authentication.
C. It is provided using NGINX acting as a proxy web server.
D. It is not supported on Cisco devices.

Answer: C

Explanation
When a device boots up with the startup configuration, the nginx process will be running. NGINX is an internal webserver that acts as a proxy webserver. It provides Transport Layer Security (TLS)-based HTTPS. RESTCONF request sent via HTTPS is first received by the NGINX proxy web server, and the request is transferred to the confd web server for further syntax/semantics check.

Which reason could cause an OSPF neighborship to be in the EXSTART/EXCHANGE state?
A. mismatched OSPF link costs
B. mismatched OSPF network type
C. mismatched areas
D. mismatched MTU size

Answer: D

Explanation
When OSPF adjacency is formed, a router goes through several state changes before it becomes fully adjacent with its neighbor. The states are Down -> Attempt (optional) -> Init -> 2-Way -> Exstart -> Exchange -> Loading -> Full. Short descriptions about these states are listed below:
Down: no information (hellos) has been received from this neighbor.
Attempt: only valid for manually configured neighbors in an NBMA environment. In Attempt state, the router sends unicast hello packets every poll interval to the neighbor, from which hellos have not been received within the dead interval.
Init: specifies that the router has received a hello packet from its neighbor, but the receiving router’s ID was not included in the hello packet
2-Way: indicates bi-directional communication has been established between two routers.
Exstart: Once the DR and BDR are elected, the actual process of exchanging link state information can start between the routers and their DR and BDR.
Exchange: OSPF routers exchange database descriptor (DBD) packets
Loading: In this state, the actual exchange of link state information occurs Full: routers are fully adjacent with each other (Reference:
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk365/technologies_tech_note09186a0080093f0e.s html)
Neighbors Stuck in Exstart/Exchange State the problem occurs most frequently when attempting to run OSPF between a Cisco router and another vendor’s router. The problem occurs when the maximum transmission unit (MTU) settings for neighboring router interfaces don’t match. If the router with the higher MTU sends a packet larger that the MTU set on the neighboring router, the neighboring router ignores the packet.

Which controller is the single plane of management for Cisco SD-WAN?
A. vBond
B. vSmart
C. vManage
D. vEdge

Answer: C

Explanation
The primary components for the Cisco SD-WAN solution consist of the vManage network management system (management plane), the vSmart controller (control plane), the vBond orchestrator (orchestration plane), and the vEdge router (data plane).
+ vManage – This centralized network management system provides a GUI interface to easily monitor, configure, and maintain all Cisco SD-WAN devices and links in the underlay and overlay network.
+ vSmart controller – This software-based component is responsible for the centralized control plane of the SD-WAN network. It establishes a secure connection to each vEdge router and distributes routes and policy information via the Overlay Management Protocol (OMP), acting as a route reflector. It also orchestrates the secure data plane connectivity between the vEdge routers by distributing crypto key information, allowing for a very scalable, IKE-less architecture.
+ vBond orchestrator – This software-based component performs the initial authentication of vEdge devices and orchestrates vSmart and vEdge connectivity. It also has an important role in enabling the communication of devices that sit behind Network Address Translation (NAT).
+ vEdge router – This device, available as either a hardware appliance or software-based router, sits at a physical site or in the cloud and provides secure data plane connectivity among the sites over one or more WAN transports. It is responsible for traffic forwarding, security, encryption, Quality of Service (QoS), routing protocols such as Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) and Open Shortest Path First (OSPF), and more.

Which statement about a fabric access point is true?
A. It is in local mode and must be connected directly to the fabric edge switch.
B. It is in local mode and must be connected directly to the fabric border node.
C. It is in FlexConnect mode and must be connected directly to the fabric border node.
D. It is in FlexConnect mode and must be connected directly to the fabric edge switch.

Answer: A

Explanation
Fabric mode APs continue to support the same wireless media services that traditional APs support; apply AVC, quality of service (QoS), and other wireless policies; and establish the CAPWAP control plane to the fabric WLC. Fabric APs join as local-mode APs and must be directly connected to the fabric edge node switch to enable fabric registration events, including RLOC assignment via the fabric WLC. The fabric edge nodes use CDP to recognize APs as special wired hosts, applying special port configurations and assigning the APs to a unique overlay network within a common EID space across a fabric. The assignment allows management simplification by using a single subnet to cover the AP infrastructure at a fabric site.

Link1 is a copper connection and Link2 is a fiber connection. The fiber port must be the primary port for all forwarding. The output of the show spanning-tree command on SW2 shows that the fiber port is blocked by spanning tree. An engineer enters the spanning-tree port-priority 32 command on G0/1 on SW2, but the port remains blocked.
Which command should be entered on the ports that are connected to Link2 to resolve the issue?
A. Enter spanning-tree port-priority 4 on SW2.
B. Enter spanning-tree port-priority 32 on SW1.
C. Enter spanning-tree port-priority 224 on SW1.
D. Enter spanning-tree port-priority 64 on SW2.

Answer: B

Explanation
SW1 needs to block one of its ports to SW2 to avoid a bridging loop between the two switches. Unfortunately, it blocked the fiber port Link2. But how does SW2 select its blocked port? Well, the answer is based on the BPDUs it receives from SW1. answer 'Enter spanning-tree port-priority 32 on SW1' BPDU is superior than another if it has:
1. answer 'Enter spanning-tree port-priority 32 on SW1' lower Root Bridge ID
2. answer 'Enter spanning-tree port-priority 32 on SW1' lower path cost to the Root
3. answer 'Enter spanning-tree port-priority 32 on SW1' lower Sending Bridge ID
4. answer 'Enter spanning-tree port-priority 32 on SW1' lower Sending Port ID
These four parameters are examined in order. In this specific case, all the BPDUs sent by SW1 have the same Root Bridge ID, the same path cost to the Root and the same Sending Bridge ID.
The only parameter left to select the best one is the Sending Port ID (Port ID = port priority +
port index). And the port index of Gi0/0 is lower than the port index of Gi0/1 so Link 1 has been chosen as the primary link.
Therefore we must change the port priority to change the primary link. The lower numerical value of port priority, the higher priority that port has. In other words, we must change the port-priority on Gi0/1 of SW1 (not on Gi0/1 of SW2) to a lower value than that of Gi0/0.

Which feature does Cisco TrustSec use to provide scalable, secure communication throughout a network?
A. security group tag ACL assigned to each port on a switch
B. security group tag number assigned to each user on a switch
C. security group tag number assigned to each port on a network
D. security group tag ACL assigned to each router on a network

Answer: B

Explanation
Cisco TrustSec uses tags to represent logical group privilege. This tag, called a Security Group Tag (SGT), is used in access policies. The SGT is understood and is used to enforce traffic by Cisco switches, routers and firewalls . Cisco TrustSec is defined in three phases: classification, propagation and enforcement.
When users and devices connect to a network, the network assigns a specific security group. This process is called classification. Classification can be based on the results of the authentication or by associating the SGT with an IP, VLAN, or port-profile (-> Answer ‘security group tag ACL assigned to each port on a switch’ and answer ‘security group tag number assigned to each user on a switch’ are not correct as they say “assigned … on a switch” only. Answer ‘security group tag ACL assigned to each router on a network’ is not correct either as it says “assigned to each router”).

Which technology does CEF switching use on Cisco hardware-based routers to forward packets?
A. router general-purpose CPU
B. interVLAN routing using subinterfaces
C. forwarding engines implemented in specialized ASICs
D. route processors using stateful switchover

Answer: C

Explanation
CEF switching on Cisco hardware-based routers uses forwarding engines implemented in specialized ASICs to forward packets. Cisco software-based routers use the general-purpose CPU for packet switching. InterVLAN routing using subinterfaces is not a CEF technology, and route processors using stateful switchover is a redundancy technology used by routers.

Question 155 - Checked

Which two network design features require Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) to ensure correct network operation? (Choose two.)
A. link-state dynamic routing that provides redundant routes
B. removing single points of failure with multiple Layer 2 switches
C. implementing VLANs to contain broadcasts
D. static default routes
E. redundant links between Layer 2 switches

Answer: BE

Explanation
Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) is required to ensure correct network operation when designing a network with multiple interconnected Layer 2 switches or using redundant links to eliminate single points of failure between Layer 2 switches. Routing is a Layer 3 function and does not relate to STP. VLANs do reduce the number of broadcast domains but relate to Layer 3 subnets, not STP.

Question 158 - Checked
If left to default configuration settings, what will determine which switch becomes the spanning-tree root bridge in a Layer 2 domain?
A. the highest bridge priority
B. the lowest switch MAC address
C. the highest bridge ID
D. the highest management IP address

Answer: B

Explanation
By default, all switches will have the same priority value, so the election of the root bridge will be based on the lowest MAC address.

Question 159 - Checked
During the implementation of Spanning Tree Protocol, all switches are rebooted by the network administrator. What is the first step of the spanning-tree election process?
A. Each switch determines the best path to forward traffic.
B. All the switches send out BPDUs advertising themselves as the root bridge.
C. Each switch determines what port to block to prevent a loop from occurring.
D. Each switch with a lower root ID than its neighbor will not send BPDUs.

Answer: B

Explanation
After a Cisco switch boots, it will send out BPDUs containing its individual BID and the root ID for the network. By default, the initial root ID at bootup will be the ID of that individual switch. After a root bridge is elected, port states and paths are chosen.

Question 160 - Checked
After the election of the root bridge has been completed, how will switches find the best paths to the root bridge?
A. Each switch will analyze the sum of the hops to reach the root and use the path with the fewest hops.
B. Each switch will analyze the port states of all neighbors and use the designated ports to forward traffic to the root.
C. Each switch will analyze the BID of all neighbors to reach the root and use the path through the lowest BID neighbors.
D. Each switch will analyze the sum of all port costs to reach the root and use the path with the lowest cost.

Answer: D

Explanation
After the election of a root bridge has occurred, each switch will have to determine the best path to the root bridge from its location. The path is determined by summing the individual port costs along the path from each switch port to the root bridge.

Question 161 - Checked
Which statement describes the term bridge priority in the operation of STP?
A. It is a value that decides which switch can become the root bridge.
B. It is a value that is used, in the event of a loop, to decide which port on the switch must be put into forwarding state.
C. It is a feature that allows access ports to bypass the earlier learning and listening states and forward traffic immediately.
D. It is a safety mechanism that shuts down ports configured with STP portfast upon receipt of a BPDU.

A. listening
B. disabled
C. learning
D. forwarding
E. blocking

Answer: CD

Explanation
Switches learn MAC addresses at the learning and forwarding port states. They receive and process BPDUs at the blocking, listening, learning, and forwarding port states.

Question 164
Which STP priority configuration would ensure that a switch would always be the root switch?
A. spanning-tree vlan 10 priority 0
B. spanning-tree vlan 10 priority 61440
C. spanning-tree vlan 10 priority 4096
D. spanning-tree vlan 10 root primary

Answer: A

Explanation
Although the spanning-tree vlan 10 root primary command will ensure a switch will have a bridge priority value lower than other bridges introduced to the network, the spanning-tree vlan 10 priority 0 command ensures the bridge priority takes precedence over all other priorities.

The network has converged and Switch_6 has been elected root bridge of the STP tree. However, network traffic analysis indicates that Switch_1 would be a better root bridge. How can the network administrator make this change, assuming that the spanning-tree priorities are at the default settings?
A. Set the bridge priority of Switch_1 to 4,096.
B. Set the bridge priority of Switch_6 to 255.
C. Set the bridge priority of Switch_6 to 65,565.
D. Set the bridge priority of Switch_1 to 32,768.

Answer: A

Explanation
The switch priority is a value between 0-61,440 in increments of 4,096. Switch priority is initially set to 32,768 (the default). Therefore, Switch_1 can become the root bridge if the priority is set to a value between 0-28,672.

Question 166 - Checked
Why is it important that the network administrator consider the spanning-tree network diameter when choosing the root bridge?
A. BPDUs may be discarded because of expiring timers.
B. The network diameter limitation is 9.
C. The cabling distance between the switches is 100 meters.
D. Convergence is slower as the BPDU travels away from the root.

Answer: A

Explanation
The optional diameter keyword in the spanning-tree vlan vlan-id root {primary | secondary} [diameter diameter] command allows for tuning of the STP convergence. The diameter keyword should reference the maximum number of Layer 2 hops that a switch can be from the root bridge and modify the timers accordingly. The timers do not need to be modified on other switches because they are carried throughout the topology through the root bridge BPDUs.

Question 167 - Checked
A network administrator enters the spanning-tree portfast bpduguard default command. What is the result of this command being issued on a Cisco switch?
A. Any switch port that receives a BPDU will ignore the BPDU message.
B. Any switch port will be error-disabled if it receives a BPDU.
C. Any trunk ports will be allowed to connect to the network immediately, rather than waiting to converge.
D. Any switch port that has been configured with PortFast will be error-disabled if it receives a BPDU.

Answer: D

Explanation
The spanning-tree bpduguard default command will enable BPDU guard on all switch ports that have PortFast-enabled. This will put the port in an error-disabled state if a BPDU from another switch is received on a PortFast-enabled interface.

Question 168 - Checked
In what situation would a network administrator most likely implement root guard?
A. on all switch ports that connect to a Layer 3 device
B. on all switch ports that connect to another switch
C. on all switch ports that connect to host devices
D. on all switch ports (used or unused)
E. on all switch ports that connect to another switch that is not the root bridge

Answer: E

Explanation
Root guard in conjunction with PortFast, and BPDU guard is used to prevent an STP manipulation attack.

Question 169
Which two statements describe the MST internal spanning tree instance? (Choose two)
A. It carries all VLANs traffic.
B. It carries identical setup information among interconnected MST regions.
C. It is always instance 0.
D. It runs on all switch port interfaces of switches that are designated as root bridges.
E. It runs on all switch port interfaces of switches in the MST region.

Answer: CE

Explanation
MST uses a special STP instance called the internal spanning tree (IST), which is always the first instance, instance 0. The IST runs on all switch port interfaces for switches in the MST region, regardless of the VLANs associated with the ports.

Question 170
What are the two options that describe the effects of the spanning-tree portfast command? (Choose two.)
A. Portfast bypasses the learning state and moves immediately into blocking.
B. If a switch port is configured with PortFast, it is an access port that immediately transitions from a blocking to forwarding state.
C. Portfast enables the port to bypass the listening and learning states of STP.
D. Enabling PortFast on trunks that connect to other switches improves convergence.
E. If the switch port is configured with PortFast, it waits 15 seconds before transitioning from a blocking to forwarding state.

Answer: BC

Explanation
The portfast feature is enabled on a specific access port with the spanning-tree portfast command. One of the benefits of the STP portfast feature, is that the access ports bypass the earlier 802.1D STP states (learning and listening) and forward traffic immediately.

Question 171 - Checked
Which LACP technology is used for designating a specific number of member interfaces that must remain active in order for the EtherChannel bundle to be usable?
A. LACP port priority
B. LACP fast
C. LACP min-links
D. LACP system priority

Answer: C

Explanation
LACP fast advertises an LACP packet every second and after three seconds of not receiving an LACP packet, removes the link from the EtherChannel bundle.
LACP port priority allows an LACP enabled switch to select which member interfaces are active within a port-channel that has more member interfaces than the maximum allowed.
LACP system priority allows an LACP enabled switch to be designated as the master switch for a port-channel.
LACP min-links is used to configure a required minimum number of physical connections that must be active in order for the EtherChannel to stay active.

Question 172 - Checked
Which statement describes the term root port in the operation of STP?
A. It indicates that the port has transitioned from a blocking state and can send or receive BPDUs, but cannot forward any other network traffic.
B. It is a port state that can forward all network traffic and can update the MAC address table.
C. It is a port state that can modify the MAC address table with any network traffic that it receives, but only forwards BPDUs and not any other network traffic.
D. It is a port that connects to the root bridge or an upstream switch in the spanning-tree topology.

Answer: D

Explanation
The mst version number and region name must match for all switches in the same MST region. These parameters can be adjusted through MST configuration.

Question 174
Assuming that all switches in a network have the default bridge priority for each MST instance, what effect does the command spanning-tree mst 10 root seconday have when entered on a single switch?
A. sets the bridge priority on the switch to 28672 for MST instance 10
B. sets the bridge priority on the switch to 24586 for MST instance 10
C. sets the bridge priority on the switch to 24582 for MST instance 10
D. sets the bridge priority on the switch to 24576 for MST instance 10

Answer: A

Explanation
In MST configuration, an MST instance priority can be defined in one of two methods:
spanning-tree mst instance-number priority priority , where the priority is a value between 0 and 61,440, in increments of 4096
spanning-tree mst instance-number root { primary | secondary }[ diameter diameter ], where the primary keyword sets the priority to 24,576, and the secondary keyword sets the priority to 28,672

C. The command spanning-tree mst 1 root secondary was entered.
D. SW1 is running IEEE 802.1S protocol.
E. PortFast is enabled on ports Gi1/0/2 and Gi1/0/3.

Answer: BD

Explanation
SW1 is running MST, which is IEEE 802.1S standard. IEEE 802.1W is the standard for RSTP. SW1 is the root bridge for instance 1. The instance 1 priority is set as 24576. If it is set through the secondary keyword, it would be 28672. If the portfast feature is enabled on a port, the port type would be P2p Edge.

Question 176 - Checked
Refer to the exhibit. A network administrator is configuring MST tuning on SW1. The objective is to change the path cost value of the interface Gi1/0/1 to represent a higher-speed bandwidth link. Which value could be used in the command spanning-tree mst 0 cost for this task?

Show spanning-tree mst 0

A. 0
B. 1
C. 24576
D. 32768

Answer: B

Explanation
As shown in the output, the interface STP cost is derived from the media speed of the interface using the long-mode method. Using this method, the range of the interface path cost is from 1 to 200000000. A lower path cost represents higher-speed transmission bandwidth.

Question 177 - Checked
What are two misconfigurations within an MST region that might introduce port blocking unintentionally? (Choose two.)
A. trunk link pruning
B. too many VLANs assigned to an instance
C. VLAN assignment to the IST
D. misconfigured revision number across the MST region
E. misconfigured region name across the MST region

Answer: AC

Explanation
VLAN assignment to the IST and trunk link pruning are two common misconfigurations within the MST region. A misconfigured region name or misconfigured revision number will cause the failure in forming the MST region.

Question 178 - Checked
How does an MST region send VLAN information through the PVST simulation mechanism to a switch that runs PVST+?
A. It sends out PVST+ BPDUs, one for each VLAN, using the information from the IST.
B. It sends out one PVST+ BPDU with the information from the IST.
C. It sends out one PVST+ BPDU that maps all VLANs into VLAN1.
D. It sends out multiple PVST+ BPDUs, one for each VLAN, plus the IST.

Answer: A

Explanation
The PVST simulation mechanism sends out PVST+ including RSTP BPDUs, one for each VLAN, using the information derived from the internal spanning tree (IST). This requires a mapping of one topology in IST to multiple VLANs toward the PVST link.

Question 179

Question 182
Which is a characteristic of EtherChannel?
A. STP treats all interfaces in an EtherChannel bundle as a single logical link.
B. EtherChannel uses physical ports that have been upgraded to provide a faster connection.
C. EtherChannel configuration is applied to each physical port.
D. STP will not block redundant EtherChannel bundles between two switches.

Answer: A

Explanation
Because EtherChannel creates one logical link out of a number of physical ports, STP will treat the one logical link as an individual connection. When a physical port that is part of the logical link fails, the link will stay active and STP will not recalculate.

Question 183
Refer to the exhibit. The administrator tried to create an EtherChannel between S1 and the other two switches via the commands that are shown, but was unsuccessful. What is the problem?

The guidelines for configuring an EtherChannel link are as follows:
Interfaces which form an EtherChannel can be physically discontiguous, and on different modules.
Interfaces in an EtherChannel have to operate at the same speed and in the same duplex mode.
Interfaces in the EtherChannel must be assigned to the same VLAN, or be configured as a trunk.
Interfaces in the EtherChannel have to support the same allowed range of VLANs.

Which statement is true about the port roles of the 802.1w Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol?
A. Cisco-proprietary enhancements to the legacy 802.1D, such as UplinkFast and BackboneFast, are compatible with RSTP.
B. An alternate or backup port can immediately change to a forwarding state without waiting for the network to converge.
C. It takes an edge port 15 seconds to go from blocking to forwarding.
D. Ports are manually configured to be in the designated role.

Answer: B

Explanation
In order to create a loop-free topology, 802.1w RSTP has the following port roles: root, designated, alternate, edge, and backup. RSTP is able to actively confirm that a port can safely transition to the forwarding state without having to rely on a timer configuration.

Question 187
Which technology is used to protect the switched infrastructure from problems caused by receiving BPDUs on ports that should not be receiving them?
A. Loop guard
B. PortFast
C. BPDU guard
D. RSPAN
E. Root guard

Answer: C

Explanation
To form a single path through a Layer 2 network, Layer 2 devices communicate with one another by the use of bridge protocol data units (BPDUs) as part of the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP). An attacker manipulates STP by spoofing the root bridge so that a device that is controlled by the attacker becomes a root bridge. The attacker can then obtain more information about the network or networks. BPDU guard can be used on ports that connect to user devices that are configured with PortFast so that BPDUs will not be accepted through that port.

Question 188
Which statement describes the term blocking in the operation of STP?
A. It is a port state that can modify the MAC address table with any network traffic that it receives, but only forwards BPDUs and not any other network traffic.
B. It indicates that the port is in an administratively off position.
C. It is a port state that is enabled but does not forward any traffic to ensure that a loop does not occur.
D. It indicates that the port has transitioned from a blocking state and can send or receive BPDUs, but cannot forward any other network traffic.

Answer: C

Question 197
Which type of routing protocol uses LSAs and TLVs to support extended features?
A. path vector
B. link-state
C. hybrid
D. distance vector

Answer: B

Explanation
Link-state routing protocols include capabilities such as LSAs for OSPF and TLVs (type/length/value) for IS-IS that allow them to support extended features.

Question 198
What are two characteristics of link-state routing protocols? (Choose two.)
A. They can load balance across unequal metric cost paths.
B. They use path attributes to determine the best loop-free path.
C. They periodically send full routing table updates to directly connected neighbors.
D. They provide routers with a synchronized identical map of the network.
E. They use more CPU and memory resources than distance vector protocols do.

Answer: DE

Explanation
Link-state protocols like OSPF and ISIS use more CPU and memory resources than distance vector protocols do because they maintain a complete synchronized map of the network and run the SPF algorithm to determine the best path.

Question 199 - Checked
What data is used by OSPF and ISIS for loop prevention?
A. hop count to the destination
B. feasible distance calculation to the destination
C. autonomous system path to the destination
D. a synchronized map of the network

Answer: D

Explanation
OSPF and ISIS are link-state routing protocols. As link-state routing protocols they have a synchronized and identical map of the network. Using the complete map of the network, every router in the network then runs the Dijkstra shortest path first (SPF) algorithm to calculate the best shortest loop-free paths.

Question 200 - Checked
Which routing protocol incorporates characteristics of both distance vector and link-state protocols?
A. iBGP
B. EBGP
C. ISIS
D. EIGRP

Answer: D

Explanation
As a hybrid routing protocol, EIGRP incorporates the characteristics of both distance vector and link-state protocols. It uses bandwidth and other metrics rather than hop count to determine the best path and this information is advertised to all neighbors.

Question 201 - Checked
How do EIGRP routers establish and maintain neighbor relationships?
A. by exchanging routing tables with directly attached routers
B. by exchanging neighbor tables with directly attached routers
C. by comparing known routes to information received in updates

Explanation
The route chosen for forwarding a packet is the route with the longest prefix length matching the destination network of the packet. The metric and administrative distance are used to determine which routes will appear in the routing table.

Question 203 - Checked
What is the effect of configuring the ipv6 unicast-routing command on a router?
A. to assign the router to the all-nodes multicast group
B. to permit only unicast packets on the router
C. to enable the router as an IPv6 router
D. to prevent the router from joining the all-routers multicast group

Answer: C

Explanation
When the ipv6 unicast-routing command is implemented on a router, it enables the router as an IPv6 router. Use of this command also assigns the router to the all-routers multicast group.

Question 204 - Checked
Why would a floating static route be configured with an administrative distance that is higher than the administrative distance of a dynamic routing protocol that is running on the same router?
A. to load-balance the traffic
B. to act as a gateway of last resort
C. to be used as a backup route
D. to be the priority route in the routing table

Answer: C

Explanation
By default, dynamic routing protocols have a higher administrative distance than static routes. Configuring a static route with a higher administrative distance than that of the dynamic routing protocol will result in the dynamic route being used instead of the static route. However, should the dynamically learned route fail, then the static route will be used as a backup.

Question 205
Which static route statement shows a recursive IPv6 static route?
A. ipv6 route 2001:db8:cafe:1::/56 S0/0/0
B. ipv6 route 0::/0 S0/0/0
C. ipv6 route 0::/0 S0/0/0 254
D. ipv6 route 2001:db8:cafe:1::/56 S0/0/0 2001:db8:1000:10::1
E. ipv6 route 2001:db8:cafe:1::/56 2001:db8:1000:10::1

Answer: E

Explanation
In a recursive static route, only the next-hop IPv6 address is specified. As a consequence, the router must perform a recursive route table lookup to find an exit interface associated with the network of the IPv6 address.

Question 206
Refer to the exhibit. Which command will properly configure an IPv6 static route on R2 that will allow traffic from PC2 to reach PC1 without any recursive lookups by router R2?

                                  2001:db8:32::/64
PC1 - - - - - - - S1 - - - - - - R1 - - - - - - R2 - - - - - - S2 - - - - - - - PC2

                                          S0/0/0  S0/0/1

A. R2(config)# ipv6 route 2001:db8:10:12::/64 S0/0/0
B. R2(config)# ipv6 route ::/0 2001:db8:32::1
C. R2(config)# ipv6 route 2001:db8:10:12::/64 S0/0/1
D. R2(config)# ipv6 route 2001:db8:10:12::/64 2001:db8:32::1

Answer: A

Explanation
A nonrecursive route must have an exit interface specified from which the destination network can be reached. In this example 2001:db8:10:12::/64 is the destination network and R2 will use exit interface S0/0/0 to reach that network. Therefore, the static route would be ipv6 route 2001:db8:10:12::/64 S0/0/0.

Question 207
Refer to the exhibit. 

  .33       .34
R1 ========== ISP
  .37       .38

Router R1 has an OSPF neighbor relationship with the ISP router over the 192.168.0.32 network. The 192.168.0.36 network link should serve as a backup when the OSPF link goes down. The floating static route command ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 S0/0/1 100 was issued on R1 and now traffic is using the backup link even when the OSPF link is up and functioning. Which change should be made to the static route command so that traffic will only use the OSPF link when it is up?​
A. Add the next hop neighbor address of 192.168.0.36.
B. Change the administrative distance to 1.
C. Change the destination network to 192.168.0.34.
D. Change the administrative distance to 120.

Answer: D

Explanation
The problem with the current floating static route is that the administrative distance is set too low. The administrative distance will need to be higher than that of OSPF, which is 110, so that the router will only use the OSPF link when it is up.

Question 208
What is used by BGP to guarantee a loop free path to reach a destination?
A. the count of router hops to reach a destination
B. the cumulative cost as measured in bandwidth
C. a record of each autonomous system that a routing advertisement has traversed
D. a distance calculation based on cumulative delay and minimum bandwidth

Answer: C

Explanation
BGP is a path vector protocol which uses several path attributes to determine the best path. To prevent loops BGP updates include a record of each autonomous system that the routing advertisement traversed. A BGP router that receives the update should not see its own AS in the AS Path. If it did, it would indicate a loop.

Question 209
What is the purpose for creating VRFs on a router?
A. to isolate paths
B. to determine the vector to reach a destination network
C. to prevent routing loops
D. to keep a record of all autonomous systems that routing advertisements have traversed

Answer: A

Explanation
Virtual routing and forwarding, or VRF, is a technology that creates several separate virtual routers on a single physical router. Each of the virtual routers acts as an independent and separate router so that their paths are isolated from each other.

B. a reported distance less than 3523840
C. an administrative distance less than 170
D. a reported distance greater than 41024000

Answer: B

Explanation
To meet the feasibility condition, the reported distance (RD) to a network must be less than the current feasible distance to the same destination network. In this example the current feasible distance is 3523840. This means that to be a feasible successor, a route would need a reported distance less than 3523840.

Question 216
Which statement describes the autonomous system number used in EIGRP configuration on a Cisco router?
A. It carries the geographical information of the organization.
B. It is a globally unique autonomous system number that is assigned by IANA.
C. It functions as a process ID in the operation of the router.
D. It identifies the ISP that provides the connection to network of the organization.

Answer: C

Explanation
The autonomous system number used in the EIGRP configuration is not associated with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) globally assigned autonomous system numbers that are used by external routing protocols. It just functions as a process ID, which is necessary because a router may run multiple instances of EIGRP. Each instance of EIGRP can be configured to support and exchange routing updates for different networks. An organization has the freedom to choose its own AS number in the EIGRP configuration.

Routing protocols with two or more paths to a destination network can load balance traffic across multiple paths. EIGRP is the only routing protocol that supports load balancing across unequal cost paths.

Question 221
How has the EIGRP routing protocol improved by having interface delay measured in picoseconds instead of microseconds?
A. It allows for a larger number of networks.
B. It speeds up convergence.
C. It improves performance and communication time between directly connected neighbor routers.
D. It provides better metrics for high speed interfaces.

Answer: D

Explanation
The original values used to calculate EIGRP metrics were in microseconds for delay and kilobytes per second for bandwidth. When using EIGRP wide metrics, the delay units are picoseconds and within the formula, the metric is found by multiplying by 65,535 instead of 256, thus providing support of interface bandwidth up to 655 terabits per second.

Question 222 - Checked
If all router Ethernet interfaces in an EIGRP network are configured with the default EIGRP timers, how long will a router wait by default to receive an EIGRP packet from its neighbor before declaring the neighbor unreachable?
A. 10 seconds
B. 15 seconds
C. 20 seconds
D. 30 seconds

Answer: B

Explanation
EIGRP uses the hold time as the maximum time it should wait for receiving a hello packet (or other EIGRP packets) from its neighbor before declaring that the neighbor is unreachable. By default the hold time is 3 times greater than the hello interval. On LAN interfaces, the default hello time is 5 seconds and the default hold time is 15 seconds.

Question 223
What two conditions will result in an EIGRP route going into the active state? (Choose two.)
A. The router is not sending queries.
B. The successor is down.
C. The network has been recalculated.
D. There is no feasible successor.
E. One neighbor has not met the feasibility condition.

Answer: BD

Explanation
If a successor is no longer available, and there is no feasible successor, an EIGRP route will be put into the active state while the router actively searches for a new path to the destination.

Question 224 - Checked
An EIGRP router loses the route to a network. Its topology table contains two feasible successors to the same network. What action will the router take?
A. The router will query neighbors for an alternate route.
B. The best alternative backup route is immediately inserted into the routing table.
C. The router uses the default route.
D. The DUAL algorithm is recomputed to find an alternate route.

Answer: B

Explanation
Because EIGRP uses the DUAL algorithm, the router is able to maintain information on all potential loop-free backup routes. In the event of the failure of a routing table entry, the router immediately inserts the best backup route into the routing table.

Question 225 - Checked
Which feature of the EIGRP routing protocol can provide fast re-convergence without DUAL recomputation in the event of a route failure?
A. having a route in the active state
B. having a successor route
C. having a feasible successor route
D. having a route in the passive state

Answer: C

Explanation
EIGRP avoids DUAL recomputation of routes whenever possible by maintaining a list of backup routes (feasible successors) in the topology table already determined to be loop-free. If the primary route (the successor route, which is in the passive state) in the routing table fails, the best backup route is immediately added to the routing table. A route in the active state is in the process of being recomputed by DUAL.

Question 226
What are two benefits of applying summarization to networks within a company that uses the EIGRP routing protocol? (Choose two.)
A. reduced impact when a route goes active
B. reduced number of routers that must maintain a neighbor adjacency
C. reduced number of Layer 3 switches required
D. reduced number of hops the packet must travel throughout the network
E. reduced size of routing tables

Answer: AE

Explanation
When summarization is applied within any routing protocol, the routing tables within the organization are smaller. An added benefit to EIGRP-enabled routers is that when a route goes active during convergence or when a link has gone down and there is no feasible successor, the number of routers that receive query packets is reduced.

D. All OSPF networks require the use of multiple areas.
E. OSPF areas create a three-layer hierarchical design.
F. Single area OSPF networks must be configured in Area 1.

Answer: AC

Explanation
OSPF is designed with a hierarchical architecture using the concept of areas. An area is a collection of connected networks and is identified with the network command. Area 0 is a special area known as the backbone. All other areas must connect to Area 0.

Question 233 - Checked
Which three requirements are necessary for two OSPFv2 routers to form an adjacency? (Choose three.)
A. The OSPF hello or dead timers on each router must match.
B. The link interface subnet masks must match.
C. The OSPFv2 process ID must be the same on each router.
D. The two routers must include the inter-router link network in an OSPFv2 network command.
E. The OSPFv2 process is enabled on the interface by entering the ospf process area-id command.
F. The link interface on each router must be configured with a link-local address.

Answer: ABD

Explanation
The OSPFv2 process ID does not have to be the same on each router, and it is enabled globally, not separately on each interface. OSPFv3 (IPv6) uses link-local addresses to form an adjacency with a neighbor router, and requires the OSPF process to be enabled on the interface.

A. Use redundant links and alternate paths between routers.
B. Increase hello and dead interval timers.
C. Ensure that the interfaces of all routers are configured for area 0.
D. Divide the OSPF network into multiple areas.

Answer: D

Explanation
As OSPF areas grow in size, the size of the LSDB grows and the number of type 1 and type 2 LSAs increases. Breaking an OSPF domain into multiple areas reduces the size of the LSDB and the number type 1 and 2 LSAs in each area.

O*E2 0.0.0.0/0 [110/1] via 192.168.2.1, 00:04:53, GigabitEthernet0/0

What can be concluded about network 192.168.1.0 in the R2 routing table?
A. This network has been learned from an internal router within the same area.
B. This network was learned through summary LSAs from an ABR.
C. This network is directly connected to the interface GigabitEthernet0/0.
D. This network should be used to forward traffic toward external networks.

Answer: B

Explanation
in a routing table, the designation O IA means the entry was learned from an interarea LSA that was generated from an ABR. The C label indicates a network that is directly connected to an interface on the router. The O label indicates a network that is advertised by another router in the same area. The label O*E2 indicates an external network. In this case, the network designation of 0.0.0.0/0 indicates that this external network is the default route for all traffic that is destined for external networks.

Answer: C

Explanation
An OSPF area contains one set of link-state information, although each router within the area will process that information individually to form its own SPF tree. OSPF process IDs are locally significant and are created by the administrator. Router IDs uniquely identify each router.

Question 250
The network administrator has been asked to summarize the routes for a new OSPF area. The networks to be summarized are 172.16.8.0, 172.16.10.0, and 172.16.12.0 with subnet masks of 255.255.255.0 for each network. Which command should the administrator use to forward the summary route for area 15 into area 0?
A. area 0 range 172.16.8.0 255.255.248.0
B. area 0 range 172.16.8.0 255.255.255.248
C. area 15 range 172.16.8.0 255.255.248.0
D. area 15 range 172.16.8.0 255.255.255.248

Answer: C

Explanation
Because all OSPF networks start with area 0, the new area would need to be anything but area 0, The correct option would be area 15 range 172.16.8.0 255.255.248.0 because this is the correct summarization of the networks in the new area 15. The summarization must come from area 15 to area 0, because all OSPF areas interconnect via area 0. The matching bits for the correct option, in binary, are:
172.16.8.0 10101100.00010000.00001 000.00000000
172.16.10.0 10101100.00010000.00001 010.00000000
172.16.12.0 10101100.00010000.00001 100.00000000

Question 251 - Checked
Which statement is true about the difference between OSPFv2 and OSPFv3?
A. OSPFv3 routers do not need to elect a DR on multiaccess segments.
B. OSPFv3 routers use a 128 bit router ID instead of a 32 bit ID.
C. OSPFv3 routers use a different metric than OSPFv2 routers use.
D. OSPFv3 routers do not need to have matching subnets to form neighbor adjacencies.

Answer: D

Explanation
Because OSPFv3 routers form neighbor adjacencies by using the link-local address of the interface, they are not required to have global addresses configured on the interfaces. Even if they do have global addresses configured, the addresses do not have to be in the same subnet on each end of the link.

Question 253 - Checked
Which statement describes the OSPFv3 configuration process?
A. The network command is used to enable OSPFv3 on an interface.
B. The OSPFv3 router ID is manually configured as a 64-bit value.
C. An address family must be initialized before OSPFv3 is enabled on an interface.
D. IPv6 routing must be enabled before the OSPFv3 process can start.

Answer: D

Explanation
Before the OSPFv3 process will start, IPv6 routing must be enabled with the ipv6 unicast-routing command.

Question 254 - Checked

A. OSPFv3 uses a 128-bit router ID.
B. OSPFv3 and OSPFv2 use different protocol ID numbers.
C. OSPFv3 uses different packet types than OSPFv2.
D. OSPFv3 does not have built in support for neighbor authentication.

Answer: D

Explanation
OSPFv2 has built in support for neighbor authentication which OSPFv3 does not. OSPFv3 relies on IPsec for neighbor authentication.

Question 256 - Checked
How are OSPFv3 routes that are learned from type 1 LSAs identified in the IPv6 routing table?
A. O
B. EX
C. IA
D. OI

Answer: A

OSPFv3 uses the code O to identify intrarea routes learned from type 1 LSAs in the routing table.

Question 257 - Checked
A network administrator enters the command ipv6 router ospf 64 in global configuration mode. What is the result of this command?
A. The router will be assigned an autonomous system number of 64.
B. The router will be assigned a router ID of 64.
C. The OSPFv3 process will be assigned an ID of 64.
D. The reference bandwidth will be set to 64 Mb/s.

Answer: B

Explanation
The basic command to implement OSPFv3 on a router uses the same process-id parameter as OSPFv2 to assign a locally-significant number to the OSPF process. OSPF does not use autonomous system numbers. Following the assignment of the process ID, a prompt will direct the user to manually assign a router ID. After the router ID is assigned, the reference bandwidth can be set.

Question 258 - Checked
What benefit is provided to OSPFv3 with the two new LSA types, type 8 and type 9?
A. They redistribute NSSA LSAs into an area.
B. They eliminate SPF calculations when interface addresses are added or changed.
C. They permit area routers to locate ASBRs in other areas.
D. They advertise default routes learned from other protocols into the OSPFv3 domain.

Answer: B

Explanation
Two new LSA types are added to OSPFv3, type 8, link-local LSA, and type 9, interarea prefix LSA. These two LSAs advertise unicast prefixes and prevent the need for OSPF calculations when interface addresses are added or changed.

Question 269 - Checked
What is the order in determining the BGP router ID?
A. statically defined, the highest IP address of any active interfaces, and the highest IP address of any active loopback interfaces
B. statically defined, the highest IP address of any active loopback interfaces, and the highest IP address of any active interfaces
C. the highest IP address of any active interfaces, statically defined, and the highest IP address of any active loopback interfaces
D. the highest IP address of any active loopback interfaces, statically defined, and the highest IP address of any active interfaces

Answer: B

Explanation
Statically configuring the BGP router ID (RID) is a best practice to ensure RID stability. If the RID is not statically configured, the dynamic RID allocation logic uses the highest IP address of any active loopback interfaces. If there is not an active loopback interface, then the highest IP address of any active interfaces becomes the RID when the BGP process initializes.

A network administrator is configuring BGP on a router. Which configuration step is needed in order to establish the BGP session with the neighbor router?
A. Configure the keepalive timer.
B. Initialize and activate the address family.
C. Advertise the networks attached to the router.
D. Restart the BGP process.

Answer: B

Explanation
For a BGP session to initiate, one address family for a neighbor must be activated. On Cisco routers the IPv4 address family is activated by default; however, it may cause confusion when working with other address families. The BGP router configuration command no bgp default ip4-unicast disables the automatic activation of the IPv4 AFI.

Question 273 - Checked
Which two statements describe the configuration differences when MP-BGP is applied using the IPv6 protocol compared to IPv4 protocol? (Choose two.)
A. The IPv6 address family must be initialized and the neighbor activated.
B. Routers with only IPv6 addressing must have the BGP RID statically defined.
C. IPv4 addresses cannot be used to define a BGP RID.
D. IPv6 uses multicast to establish neighbor sessions.
E. Routers with only IPv6 addressing must use AS numbers beyond 65535.

Answer: AB

Explanation
The BGP configuration rules in IPv4 apply to IPv6, except that the IPv6 address family must be initialized, and the neighbor is activated. Routers with only IPv6 addressing must statically define the BGP RID to allow sessions to form.

Question 274
A network administrator is configuring IPv6 route summarization on a BGP router. The objective is to aggregate the IPv6 networks from 2001:db8:0:0::/64 to 2001:db8:0:35::/64 into a single summary route. Which aggregation command should be used for the task?
A. aggregate-address 2001:db8::/60 summary-only
B. aggregate-address 2001:db8::/61 summary-only
C. aggregate-address 2001:db8::/58 summary-only
D. aggregate-address 2001:db8::/59 summary-only

Answer: C

Explanation
The fourth hexadecimal of the IPv6 network 2001:db8:0:35::/64 is 0x35 that is equivalent to binary notation of 00110101. Thus 6 bits is the least needed for the purpose of route summarization.

For which autonomous system would running BGP not be appropriate?
A. 65004
B. 65005
C. 65003
D. 65002

Answer: C

Explanation
It is appropriate to use BGP when an autonomous system is multihomed, or has more than one connection to another autonomous system or to the Internet. BGP is not appropriate for single-homed autonomous systems. Autonomous system 65003 is a single-homed AS because it is only connected to one other autonomous system, 65002.

Question 280
A company is deploying BGP multihoming to provide internet connection redundancy. Which method can be used to avoid the internet transit routing situation?
A. deploying iBGP routing in all routers within the local AS
B. ensuring that no IGP session is running on the local BGP routers
C. designating a data center or a specific location to handle the internet transit traffic
D. applying outbound BGP route policies that only allow for local BGP routes to be advertised

Answer: D

Explanation
If an enterprise uses BGP to connect with more than one service provider, it runs the risk of its autonomous system (AS) becoming a transit AS. Because BGP uses path cost to select best path, a path through the internal BGP routers might appear with a better path cost, hence the risk of local AS providing transit routing to everyone in the internet. Transit routing can be avoided by applying outbound BGP route policies that only allow for local BGP routes to be advertised to other autonomous systems.

Which statement describes the condition when the BGP route-map TEST permit 40 command is processed and what is the result of processing?
A. Only networks that do not match ACL3 will match and be allowed.
B. Incoming networks that match ACL1, ACL2, and ACL3 will match and be allowed.
C. All incoming networks that do not match ACL1, ACL2, and ACL3 will match, but will be dropped because no action is specified.
D. All incoming networks that do not match ACL1, ACL2, and ACL3 will match and be allowed.

Answer: D

Explanation
A route map uses the command syntax route-map route-map-name [ permit | deny ] [ sequence-number ]. The rules that apply to route map statements are as follows:
If a processing action is not provided, the default value permit is used.
If a sequence number is not provided, the sequence number is incremented by 10 automatically.
If a matching statement is not included, an implied all prefixes is associated with the statement.
Processing within a route map stops after all optional actions have processed and after matching a conditional matching criterion.

Question 282
A company is deploying BGP multihoming to provide network connection redundancy for several branch locations. One of the network design objectives is to provide deterministic routing among company locations during failover by providing a specific location to handle branch transit traffic. Which two design criteria should be applied to the specific facility? (Choose two.)
A. The bandwidth can be sized according to the traffic needs.
B. The facility should be in a central place from all company locations.
C. OSPF is the preferred IGP for the facility.
D. The routing pattern is bidirectional and predictable.
E. BGP route policies should apply to only allow for local BGP routes to be advertised.

Answer: AD

Explanation
Multihomed environments should be configured so that branch routers cannot act as transit routers. In most designs, transit routing of traffic from another branch is undesirable, as WAN bandwidth may not be sized accordingly. If transit behavior is required, it should be restricted to the data centers or specific locations with these design criteria:
Proper routing design can accommodate outages.
Bandwidth can be sized accordingly.
The routing pattern is bidirectional and predictable.

Question 283
A network administrator is configuring a prefix list with the ip prefix-list command. What is the best practice in dealing with the sequence number in creating a prefix list?
A. Sequence numbers should leave enough space to accommodate additional entries.
B. Sequence numbers should start with 1.
C. Sequence numbers should be no higher than 100.
D. Sequence numbers should be incremented by 2.

Answer: A

Explanation
Prefix lists are configured with the global configuration command ip prefix-list prefix-listname [ seq sequence-number ] { permit | deny } high-order-bit-pattern / high-order-bit-count [ ge ge-value ] [ le le-value ]. Because prefix lists cannot be re-sequenced, it is advisable to leave enough space for insertion of sequence numbers at a later time.

Question 284
A network administrator is configuring a prefix list with the command

ipv6 prefix-list IPV6-1 seq 5 permit 2001:db8:abcd:30::/60 ge 61 le 63
Which two networks match the prefix match specification? (Choose two.)
A. 2001:db8:abcd:30::/60
B. 2001:db8:abcd:34::/62
C. 2001:db8:abcd:20::/62
D. 2001:db8:abcd:36::/63
E. 2001:db8:abcd:60::/64

Answer: BD

Explanation
The prefix matching logic works the same for IPv6 networks as for IPv4 networks. The fourth hexadecimal group of the match specification is 0x0030, which is 00000000 00110000 in binary. To match /60 prefix length, the fourth hexadecimal group of a network must be between 00000000 00110000 and 00000000 00111111, that is, between 0x0030 and 0x003F. The prefix length must be between /61 and /63.

Answer: E

Explanation
A route map has four components:
Sequence number: Dictates the processing order of the route map.
Conditional matching criteria: Identifies prefix characteristics (network, BGP path attribute, next hop, and so on) for a specific sequence.
Processing action: Permits or denies the prefix.
Optional action: Allows for manipulations, depending on how the route map is referenced on the router. Actions can include modification, addition, or removal of route characteristics.

Question 286
Refer to the exhibit. 

Route-map TEST [permit | deny] 10
  Match IP address ACL1 ACL2

Considering the route map configuration for BGP, which statement describes the condition for a network prefix to match the route map TEST ?
A. The network prefix needs to match both ACL1 and ACL2 independently of the processing action.
B. If the processing action is permit, the network prefix needs to match either ACL1 or ACL2.
C. The network prefix needs to match either ACL1 or ACL2 independently of the processing action.
D. If the processing action is deny, the network prefix needs to match both ACL1 and ACL2.

Answer: C

Explanation
In route map configuration, if there are multiple variables (ACLs, prefix lists, tags, and so on) configured for a specific route map sequence, only one variable must match for the prefix to qualify. The Boolean logic uses an OR operator for this configuration. The processing action is performed only after a match occurs.

Question 288 - Checked
Which three statements describe the weight attribute for BGP? (Choose three.)
A. It is a Cisco-defined attribute.
B. It is a nontransitive attribute that uses a 32-bit value called metric.
C. It is not advertised to other routers.
D. It is a 16-bit value assigned locally on the router.
E. It is not advertised between eBGP peers and is typically used to influence the next-hop address for outbound traffic.
F. It is a well-known discretionary path attribute and is included with path advertisements throughout an AS.

Answer: ACD

Explanation
BGP weight is a Cisco-defined attribute and the first step for selecting the BGP best path. Weight is a 16-bit value (0 to 65,535) assigned locally on the router; it is not advertised to other routers.

Question 289
Which BGP attribute can be configured on IBGP speakers so they will choose a desired path out of the autonomous system to an outside network?
A. local preference
B. next hop
C. MED
D. aggregate

Answer: A

Explanation
The local preference attribute indicates the preference for exiting the AS to the destination network. The local preference is not advertised between eBGP peers and is typically used to influence the next-hop address for outbound traffic (that is, leaving an autonomous system). Local preference can be set for specific routes by using a route map or for all routes received from a specific neighbor. A higher value is preferred over a lower value.

Question 290
A network administrator is configuring a prefix list to match networks for BGP route filtering. Which two networks match the prefix match specification 10.224.0.0/12 ge 24 le 28 ? (Choose two.)
A. 10.240.10.0/24
B. 10.224.10.0/12
C. 10.230.15.0/24
D. 10.239.255.240/28
E. 10.192.20.0/26

Answer: CD

Explanation
Prefix lists provide another method of identifying networks in a routing protocol. A prefix list identifies a specific IP address, network, or network range and allows for the selection of multiple networks with a variety of prefix lengths by using a prefix match specification. A prefix match specification contains two parts: a high-order bit pattern and a high-order bit count, which determines the high-order bits in the bit pattern that are to be matched. The high-order bit pattern is also known as the network address and the high-order bit count as the mask length. The network portion of the matching networks is 10.224.0.0 and higher. The mask length of the matching networks must be greater than or equal to /24 and less than or equal to /28.

A network administrator is troubleshooting BGP configuration and wants to display only routes that originated in AS 40. Which regular expression should the administrator use in the command show bgp ipv4 unicast regex regex-pattern ?
A. show bgp ipv4 unicast regex ^40_
B. show bgp ipv4 unicast regex *40_
C. show bgp ipv4 unicast regex _40$ ????
D. show bgp ipv4 unicast regex .40.

Answer: A

Explanation
In troubleshooting BGP, regular expressions (regex) can be used to parse through the large number of available ASNs. Regular expressions are based on query modifiers used to select the appropriate content. The regex pattern 100_ indicates to only include the lines that contain the exact phrase of 100. Some regex query modifiers are as follows:
(underscore) – Matches a space
^ (caret) – Indicates the start of a string
$ (dollar sign) – Indicates the end of a string
. (period) – Matches a single character, including a space

Question 292
Which two statements describe private BGP communities? (Choose two.)
A. A private BGP community requires a route map configuration.
B. Private BGP communities are used to signify no transit networks.
C. An organization needs to register for a private BGP community.
D. Private BGP communities are within the range of 0xFFFF0000 to 0xFFFFFFFF.
E. A private BGP community uses the first 16 bits to represent its AS and the second 16 bits to represent a pattern.

Answer: AE

Explanation
Private BGP communities follow a particular convention where the first 16 bits represent the AS of the community origination, and the second 16 bits represent a pattern defined by the originating AS. A private BGP community pattern can vary from organization to organization, does not need to be registered, and can signify geographic locations for one AS while signifying a method of route advertisement in another AS.

Question 293

Router bgp 300
   Neighbor 3.3.3.3 remote-as 200
   Neighbor 2.2.2.2 remote-as 100
   Network 160.10.0.0
   Aggregate-address 160.0.0.0 255.0.0.0 summary-only

Given the above configuration commands, which two statements are true? (Choose two.)
A. RTA will set the atomic aggregate attribute to false.
B. RTA will set the atomic aggregate attribute to true.
C. RTA will send the supernet route as well as all other specific BGP routes that belong to that supernet.
D. RTA will create the supernet route even if no other specific routes belonging to the supernet are in the route table.
E. RTA will send the supernet route and suppress the more specific routes known to BGP.

Answer: BD

Explanation
Route summarization on BGP edge routers via dynamic method is configured by specifying an aggregation network prefix. The aggregate-address command advertises the aggregated route (the supernet) in addition to the specific original component network prefixes. By using the optional summary-only keyword, the component network prefixes in the summarized network range are suppressed. When a BGP router summarizes a route, it does not advertise the AS_Path information from before the aggregation. This effect is indicated by the atomic aggregate attribute. The atomic aggregate attribute indicates that a loss of path information has occurred.

A network administrator issues the show bgp ipv4 unicast command to check the routes in the BGP table. What does the indication of 0.0.0.0 under Next Hop mean?
A. The route is the best route for the network prefix.
B. The route is originated from a connected network to the router.
C. The route is learned through a static route.
D. The route is learned through IGP.

Answer: B

Explanation
As the BGP prefix is installed into the Loc-RIB table, the following BGP PAs are set, depending on the RIB prefix type:
Connected network : The next-hop BGP attribute is set to 0.0.0.0, the BGP origin attribute is set to i (IGP), and the BGP weight is set to 32,768.
Static route or routing protocol : The next-hop BGP attribute is set to the next-hop IP address in the RIB, the BGP origin attribute is set to i (IGP), the BGP weight is set to 32,768, and the MED is set to the IGP metric.

Question 298 - Checked
A network administrator is configuring an ACL to match networks for BGP route filtering. The administrator creates an ACE permit ip 10.0.64.0 0.0.63.0 255.255.255.0 0.0.0.192 . Which two networks match the ACE? (Choose two.)
A. 10.0.128.0/25
B. 10.0.126.0/25
C. 10.0.130.0/24
D. 10.0.64.0/24
E. 10.0.63.0/26

Answer: BD

Explanation
One method for conditional matching of routes in BGP is through extended ACLs. When extended ACLs are used for this purpose, the source fields match against the network portion of the route, and the destination fields match against the network mask. The network portion of the matching networks is 10.0.64.0 through 10.0.127.0. The network mask portion is /24 through /26.

A network administrator is troubleshooting an IP multicast problem. Where can the administrator view source S, group G, incoming interfaces (IIF), outgoing interfaces (OIFs), and RPF neighbor information for each multicast route?
A. in unicast routing table
B. in the routing information base
C. in the multicast forwarding information base
D. in the multicast routing information base

Answer: D

Explanation
The multicast routing information base (MRIB) is a topology table that is also known as the multicast route table (mroute). The MRIB is built using PIM and the routing table. It contains the source S, group G, incoming interfaces (IIF), outgoing interfaces (OIFs), and RPF neighbor information for each multicast route as well as other multicast-related information. The command show ip mroute is used to display the full contents of the IP multicast routing table.

Question 305 - Checked
A network administrator statically assigns a multicast address of 239.255.8.5 to an application running on a server. The NIC on the server is with the MAC address of AB.54.C1.01.B8.9F. Which Layer 2 multicast address will receivers use on their interfaces in order to receive the multicast feed?
A. 01:00:5E:01:B8:9F
B. AB:54:C1:17:A8:02
C. 01:00:5E:7F:08:05
D. AB:54:C1:7F:08:05

Answer: C

Explanation
When a receiver wants to receive multicast feed from a particular multicast service, it will send a IGMP join message with the multicast IP address of the service and then reprogram the receiver interface with the matching multicast MAC address. To find the matching MAC address, do the following:
Convert the IP multicast address 239.255.8.5 to binary form, 11101111.11111111.00001000.00000101
Separate the 23 low-order binary bits from the converted address, 1111111.00001000.00000101
Convert these bits to hexadecimal: 7F:08:05
Because the first 24bits of a multicast MAC address are 01.00.5E, The resulting multicast MAC address is then 01:00:5E:7F:08:05.

Which notation is used to refer to the forwarding state in PIM shared trees?
A. (*,G)
B. (S,G)
C. (*,S)
D. (G,S)

Answer: A

Explanation
In a shared tree uses a rendezvous point (RP) as the tree root instead of the multicast source. Multicast traffic is forwarded down the shared tree to the group address (G). For this reason the forwarding state is referred to as (*,G).

Question 307
Which statement about IGMPv3 is true?
A. It sends IGMP query messages with a TTL value of 1 addressed to the all-host group (224.0.0.1).
B. It rejects any group-specific query message that is sent from the hosts that want to join a multicast group.
C. It enables a multicast receiver to signal to the first hop router the multicast sources from which it expects to receive traffic.
D. It does not accept a leave group message from the hosts that have already joined the multicast group.

Answer: C

Explanation
IGMPv3 is an extension of IGMPv2 with added support for multicast source filtering done through the use of a new message type called Version 3 membership report. It supports applications that explicitly signal sources that want to receive multicast traffic by using the membership report in the Include or Exclude mode.

Question 308
Which well-know multicast group is joined by all PIM-enabled routers to receive RP mappings?
A. 224.0.0.2
B. 224.0.0.13
C. 224.0.1.40
D. 224.0.1.39

Answer: C

Explanation
RP mapping agents advertise the RP mappings to the well-known multicast group address, 224.0.1.40 (Cisco-RP-Discovery). Advertisements are sent every 60 seconds by default, or when changes are detected. All PIM-enabled routers join 224.0.1.40 and store the RP mappings in cache.

Question 309
An administrator has configured and enabled multicast together with PIM sparse mode on all VLANs on the network. Which feature helps to reduce multicast traffic being broadcast on the access layer switches?
A. source registration
B. PIM Pruning
C. IGMP snooping
D. SPT switchover

Answer: C

Explanation
IGMP snooping stops multicast traffic from being broadcast on the access layer switches by examining IGMP joins that are sent by receivers and maintaining a table of interfaces to IGMP joins.

Question 310
Which two IGMPv3 modes are used to signal membership to a multicast host group? (Choose two.)
A. preclude
B. join
C. include
D. rendezvous
E. exclude
F. leave

Answer: CE

Explanation
The two IGMP modes that are used to signal membership are Include mode (the receiver announces membership to a multicast group and provides a include list) and Exclude mode (receiver announces membership to multicast group and provides exclude list).

Question 311
Which statement describes a characteristic of IP multicast routing?
A. PIM hello messages are sent every 60 seconds by default out each PIM enabled interface.
B. PIM dense mode flood and prune behavior repeats every three minutes.
C. PIM sparse mode builds the multicast tree through flooding of traffic out every interface.
D. PIM sparse mode and PIM dense mode require an RP on the network.

Answer: B

Explanation
PIM dense mode is used in a multicast group that is densely populated across the network. PIM dense mode (PIM-DM) prunes expire after three minutes. This means that the flood and prune behavior of PIM dense mode repeats every three minutes and should be taken into account when designing a network for PIM-DM. A rendezvous point (RP) is required only in networks running Protocol Independent Multicast sparse mode (PIM-SM).

Question 312 - Checked
To which multicast group does a candidate RP send announcement messages to advertise its willingness to be an RP?

B. 224.0.1.40
C. 224.0.1.39
D. 224.0.0.2

Answer: C

Explanation
A C-RP advertises its willingness to be an RP every 60 seconds via RP announcement messages to the reserved well-known multicast group 224.0.1.39 (Cisco-RP-Announce). RP mapping agents join group 224.0.1.39 to receive the RP announcements.

Question 313
Which two statements about Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) are true? (Choose two.)
A. Three of the forwarding modes for PIM are PIM dense mode (PIM-DM), PIM sparse mode (PIM-SM), and PIM sparse-dense mode.
B. PIM is a multicast routing protocol that makes packet-forwarding decisions independent of the unicast IP routing protocol that is running in the network.
C. PIM should be configured on the device that hosts the source of the muticast traffic.
D. PIM sparse mode is most useful when there are few senders, many receivers, and the volume of multicast traffic is high.
E. PIM should be configured only on the first and the last hop routers in the multicast tree.
F. PIM does not require an IGP protocol to be configured in the network.

Answer: AB

Explanation
PIM is a multicast routing protocol that routes multicast traffic between network segments by creating distribution trees. It makes packet-forwarding decisions independent of the unicast IP routing protocol that is running in the network. There are five operating PIM modes:
PIM dense mode (PIM-DM)
PIM sparse mode (PIM-SM)
PIM sparse dense Mode
PIM source specific multicast (PIM-SSM)
PIM bidirectional mode (Bidir-PIM)

What is a potential disadvantage when implementing HSRP as compared to GLBP?
A. HSRP does not provide load balancing with multiple active routers.
B. HSRP does not function in a multivendor environment.
C. HSRP does not have the capability to support IPv6 addresses.
D. HSRP provides default gateway failover only when the active router fails.

Answer: A

Explanation
HSRP is a first-hop redundancy protocol that can utilize a group of routers, where a single router is acting as the default gateway and all other HSRP routers will maintain a backup status. GLBP supports load balancing, where multiple active routers can share the traffic load at a single time. Both HSRP and GLBP are Cisco proprietary. HSRP provides default gateway failover when pre-set conditions are met or when the active router fails, and HSRP can support IPv6 addressing.

Question 338 - Checked
What are three advantages of using private IP addresses and NAT? (Choose three.)
A. creates multiple public IP addresses
B. reduces CPU usage on customer routers
C. hides private LAN addressing from outside devices that are connected to the Internet
D. improves the performance of the router that is connected to the Internet
E. conserves registered public IP addresses
F. permits LAN expansion without additional public IP addresses

Answer: CEF

Explanation
Private IP addresses are designed to be exclusively used for internal networks and they cannot be used on the Internet. Thus they are not visible directly from the Internet and they can be used freely by network administrators for internal networks. In order for the internal hosts to access the Internet, NAT is used to translate between private and public IP addresses. NAT takes an internal private IP address and translates it to a global public IP address before the packet is forwarded.

Question 339
A network engineer wants to synchronize the time of a router with an NTP server at the IPv4 address 209.165.200.225. The exit interface of the router is configured with an IPv4 address of 192.168.212.11. Which global configuration command should be used to configure the NTP server as the time source for this router?
A. ntp peer 209.165.200.225
B. ntp peer 192.168.212.11
C. ntp server 192.168.212.11
D. ntp server 209.165.200.225

Answer: D

Explanation
The global configuration command ntp server server ip-address will set the server at 
that address as the time source for the router. The ntp peer command which enables a router to both update the time of another similarly configured router, and also synchronize with that router if necessary, is not appropriate in this case.

Question 340

A. standby 1 ipv6 FE80::1:1
B. fhrp version vrrp v3
C. standby 6 ipv6 autoconfig
D. vrrp 22 address-family ipv6

Answer: B

Explanation
VRRPv3 supports IPv4 and IPv6 and is configured globally using the fhrp version vrrp v3 command before the vrrp instance-id address-family ipv6 interface configuration command is applied. standby 6 ipv6 autoconfig and standby 1 ipv6 FE80::1:1 are HSRP commands.

Question 341
A networking engineer is configuring an NTP client to have access to multiple NTP servers but wants one server to have priority over the others. Which command will achieve this?

B. ntp max-associations 1
C. ntp server 203.0.113.1 prefer
D. ntp master 1

Answer: C

Explanation
The ntp server 2001:DB8:0:0:800:200C:417A version 4 command configures the NTP client to synchronize with the NTP server at the specified IPv6 address but does not give it priority over other available servers. The command ntp max-associations number sets the maximum number of NTP peer-and-client associations that the router will serve. The command ntp master 1 sets the router to be a stratum level 1 NTP server.

Explanation
GRE was developed by Cisco and encapsulates a wide variety of protocol packet types inside IP tunnels. GRE is stateless and does not include any flow control mechanisms by default. GRE is defined in an IETF standard. GRE does not include any strong security mechanisms to protect the traffic that crosses the site-to-site VPN. GRE supports routing protocols by using multicast traffic as a carrier protocol. GRE headers and the tunneling IP header create additional overhead for tunneled packets. GRE provides encapsulation for multiple protocol types inside an IP tunnel.

Question 363 - Checked
By the use of sequence numbers, which function of the IPsec security services prevents spoofing by verifying that each packet is non-duplicated and unique?
A. anti-replay protection
B. confidentiality
C. authentication
D. data integrity

Answer: A

Explanation
Anti-replay protection is the ability to detect and reject replayed packets. By comparing sequence numbers, it helps prevent spoofing by verifying that each packet is unique and not duplicated. Authentication verifies the identity of the source of the data that is sent. Confidentiality is the process of taking all the data that one computer is sending to another and encoding it into a form that only the other computer will be able to decode. Data integrity is achieved by IPsec because the receiver can verify that the data was transmitted through the Internet without being changed or altered in any way.

In order for two wireless antennas to not suffer from signal degradation, the polarization of the transmitting antenna should match the polarization of the receiving antenna.

Question 391
What is the purpose of a wireless client sending a reassociation request to an AP?
A. to respond to the beacon signal sent by the AP
B. to roam from current AP to another AP
C. to form a new association with the AP
D. to find the SSID of the AP

Answer: B

Explanation
When a client wants to join the BSS of an AP, it actively scans channels and sends probe requests to discover candidate APs. The client then selects one and tries to associate with it. A wireless client can send association request and reassociation request frames to the AP selected. Association requests are used to form a new association, while reassociation requests are used to roam from one AP to another, preserving the original association status of the client.

Question 392
For its customers, a shopping center is deploying a wireless network that consists of 20 lightweight APs that are bound to a single WLC. Which type of roaming occurs when clients roam between APs on the shopping center network?
A. intercontroller roaming
B. Layer 2 roaming
C. autonomous roaming
D. intracontroller roaming

Answer: D

Explanation
When a wireless client is roaming among APs that are bound to the same WLC controller, the roam occurs entirely within the controller. This is known as intracontroller roaming. Intercontroller roaming occurs when a client is roaming among APs that are bound to different WLC controllers. Layer 2 roaming is a type of the intercontroller roaming.

Question 393
A company deploys a Cisco wireless network over a large campus. The wireless network uses lightweight APs and multiple WLCs. A network technician walks around the campus to verify that wireless clients can roam smoothly between APs bound to different WLCs and assigned different VLANs and IP subnets. The technician verifies that while the client roams around campus, the client retains the same VLAN and IP address assigned. Which roaming scenario is the technician verifying?
A. intracontroller roaming
B. local-to-local roaming
C. Layer 2 roaming
D. Layer 3 roaming

Answer: D

Explanation
In a Cisco wireless network, when a client initiates an intercontroller roam, the two controllers involved can compare the VLAN numbers that are assigned to the respective WLAN interfaces. If the VLAN IDs are the same, the client undergoes a Layer 2 intercontroller roam (also called local-to-local roam) and can continue to use the original IP address on the new controller. If the two VLAN IDs differ, the controllers arrange a Layer 3 roam that will allow the client to keep using the same IP address.

Question 394
A company deploys a Cisco wireless network over the campus. Wireless network access is needed for visitors to access the internet while on campus. What are two best practices in setting up APs and WLCs for secure wireless connections for visitors? (Choose two.)
A. only using private IP addresses for APs and clients
B. using static IP addressing for clients to better locate visitor clients
C. putting the anchor controller specific for visitors behind firewall
D. configuring a WLC to be a static anchor controller specific for visitors to associate
E. deploying autonomous APs for visitors

Answer: CD

Explanation
In Layer 3 roaming, anchor and foreign controllers are normally determined automatically. When a client first associates with an AP and a controller, that controller becomes its anchor controller. When the client roams to a different controller, that controller can take on the foreign role. However, sometimes it is desirable to control which WLC to be the anchor controller. For example, guest users should not be allowed to associate with just any controller in the network. Guests might be forced onto a specific controller that is situated behind a firewall or contained in a protected environment. This objective can be achieved by configuring one controller to be a static anchor for a WLAN so that other controllers will direct clients toward it through Layer 3 roaming tunnels.

Question 395
What is a difficulty in locating a wireless client based on the RSS value when received by only one AP?
A. The orientation where the client is situated in relation to the AP cannot be determined.
B. The RSS value is affected by the air temperature.
C. The distance from the client to the AP cannot be accurately determined.
D. The RSS value is affected by moisture in the air.

Answer: A

Explanation
To improve the accuracy of locating a device, an AP can use the received signal strength (RSS) of a client device as a measure of the distance between the two. However, if the distance is measured from a single AP only, it is difficult to determine where the client is situated in relation to the AP. In the case of an indoor AP with an omnidirectional antenna, the client could be located anywhere along a circular path of fixed distance because the received signal strength would be consistent at all points on the circle.

D. developing RF fingerprinting where each mapped area is compensated with a calibration template

Answer: D

Explanation
The Cisco approach to improve the results of wireless device location based on RSS values received by multiple APs is to implement RF fingerprinting, where each mapped area is influenced by an RF calibration template that more closely resembles the actual signal attenuation experienced by the APs and clients.

Question 398  - Checked

Question 399  - Checked
Which technique is used by Cisco WLCs to minimize the time required on key exchanges during roaming by maintaining a database of clients and keys on behalf of bound APs, and providing those clients and keys to other controllers and bound APs as needed during roaming?
A. Cisco Centralized Key Management (CCKM)
B. intercontroller roaming
C. key caching
D. 802.11r support

Answer: A

Explanation
Cisco controllers offer three techniques to minimize the time and effort spent on key exchanges during roams:
Cisco Centralized Key Management ( CCKM ): One controller maintains a database of clients and keys on behalf of bound APs and provides the clients and keys to other controllers and bound APs as needed during client roams.
Key caching : Each client maintains a list of keys used with prior AP associations and presents the keys as it roams.
802.11r : This 802.11 amendment addresses fast roaming or fast BSS transition. A client can cache a portion of the key of the authentication server and present that to future APs as it roams.

Question 400  - Checked
How is wireless client location determined based on RSS values when using three or more APs?

A. comparing the RSS values to choose the location of the AP with the highest RSS received
B. correlating the RSS values received by multiple APs to determine where the LAN switches that are connected to the APs intersect
C. correlating the RSS values received by multiple APs to determine where they intersect
D. comparing the RSS values received by multiple APs to choose the shortest straight distance

Answer: C

Explanation
To locate a device more accurately, an AP can use the received signal strength (RSS) of a client device as a measure of the distance between the two. However, if the distance is measured from a single AP only, it is difficult to determine where the client is situated in relation to the AP. A better solution is to obtain the same measurement from three or more APs, then correlate the results and determine where they intersect.

Question 401 - Checked
What technology does a Cisco WLC use to provide Layer 3 roaming to a wireless client?
A. a CAPWAP tunnel that tethers the client to the original anchor controller
B. an IPsec tunnel to connect the client to the original AP
C. a NAT translation to match the IP address in the roamed AP to the original AP
D. a GRE tunnel to relay the data between the original AP and the roamed AP

Answer: A

Explanation
A Layer 3 intercontroller roam consists of an extra CAPWAP tunnel that is built between the original controller with which the client associated (called the anchor controller) and the controller it has roamed to (called the foreign controller). The tunnel carries data to and from the client as if it is still associated with the original controller and IP subnet.

Question 410 - Checked
What advantage does WPA2 have over WPA?
A. WPA2 uses a 32-bit WEP key for encryption.
B. WPA2 allows the caching of key information.
C. WPA2 uses static key management.
D. WPA2 uses AES instead of TKIP.

Answer: D

Explanation
WPA2 uses the encryption algorithm AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) which is a stronger algorithm than WPA is, which uses TKIP (Temporal Key Integrity Protocol.) WPA was created to replace WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) which was easily compromised. However, the WPA TKIP had to take into account the older devices still using WEP on the network and as a result still had some of the WEP vulnerabilities. This was overcome with the creation of WPA2.

A. Other APs on the network are over utilizing the channel.
B. The AP has a defective radio.
C. There are too many wireless users on the network.
D. The client is too far from the AP.

Answer: D

Explanation
The connection score shown in the Client View window is determined by dividing the current data rate of the client by the lower maximum supported date rate of either the client or the AP. A connection score of 21% results from the client current data rate of 30 Mbps divided by the maximum data rate which would be 144 Mbps (30 / 144 = .21). This indicates that the client is too far away from the associated AP.

Question 433
A network administrator of a college is configuring WLAN security with WPA2 Enterprise authentication. Which server is required when deploying this type of authentication?
A. AAA
B. DHCP
C. RADIUS
D. SNMP

Answer: C

Explanation
WAP2 Enterprise provides stronger secure user authentication than WPA2 PSK does. Instead of using a pre-shared key for all users to access a WLAN, WPA2 Enterprise requires that users enter their own username and password credentials to be authenticated before they can access the WLAN. The RADIUS server is required for deploying WPA2 Enterprise authentication.

Question 434
Which two hybrid modes can cause compatibility issues when configured on a WLAN controller? (Choose two.)
A. WPA with AES
B. WPA3 with CCMK
C. WPA2 with CCMK
D. WPA2 with AES
E. WPA2 with TKIP

Answer: AE

Explanation
The WLAN will only be as secure as the weakest security suite you configure on it. Ideally, you should use WPA2 or WPA3 with AES/CCMP and try to avoid any other hybrid mode. Hybrid modes such as WPA with AES and WPA2 with TKIP can cause compatibility issues.

Question 435
Which network design solution will best extend access layer connectivity to host devices?
A. implementing redundancy
B. implementing EtherChannel
C. implementing wireless connectivity
D. implementing routing protocols

Answer: C

Explanation
EtherChannel allows more data to be moved at the access layer, but does not provide network expansion. Redundancy is used to provide failover solutions but does not focus on network expansion. Routing protocols are not used to provide network expansion at the access layer. Wireless connectivity provides network access to a large number of users at the access layer.

Question 436 
A network designer must provide a rationale to a customer for a design which will move an enterprise from a flat network topology to a hierarchical network topology. Which two features of the hierarchical design make it the better choice? (Choose two.)
A. simpler deployment for additional switch equipment
B. easier to provide redundant links to ensure higher availability
C. lower bandwidth requirements
D. less required equipment to provide the same performance levels
E. reduced cost for equipment and user training

Answer: AB

Explanation
A hierarchical design for switches helps network administrators when planning and deploying a network expansion, performing fault isolation when a problem occurs, and providing resiliency when traffic levels are high. A good hierarchical design has redundancy when it can be afforded so that one switch does not cause all networks to be down.

Question 437
What are three benefits of employing a hierarchical network design? (Choose three.)
A. Use of a hierarchical design allows replacement of redundant devices with high-capacity network equipment.
B. The hierarchical model allows the use of high-performance switches at all design layers, thus allowing for a fully-meshed topology.
C. Hierarchically designed networks can more easily be expanded to suit future needs.
D. Hierarchical design models enhance existing bandwidth through the use of link aggregation.
E. A hierarchical design uses firewalls instead of complicated port-based and distribution layer security policies.
F. The hierarchical model allows for specialized functionality at each layer, simplifying device management.

Answer: CDF

Explanation
Hierarchical design provides fault containment by constraining the network changes to a subset of the network, which affects fewer systems and makes it easy to manage as well as improve resiliency. In a modular layer design, network components can be placed or taken out of service with little or no impact to the rest of the network and this facilitates troubleshooting, problem isolation, and network management.

Question 438
At the distribution layer of a hierarchical network, what are two advantages of using Layer 3 devices instead of Layer 2 switches? (Choose two.)
A. creates fewer IP subnets to configure and manage
B. provides connectivity between different VLANs
C. enables traffic filtering based on subnet addresses
D. provides reliable connectivity to end users
E. reduces the number of redundant links required

Answer: BC

Explanation
Communication between endpoints on different access layer switches occurs through the distribution layer. The distribution layer provides a boundary between the Layer 2 domain of the access layer and the Layer 3 domain of the core. This boundary provides two key functions for the LAN. On the Layer 2 side, the distribution layer creates a boundary for Spanning Tree Protocol (STP), limiting propagation of Layer 2 faults. On the Layer 3 side, the distribution layer provides a logical point to summarize IP routing information when it enters the core layer. The summarization reduces IP route tables for easier troubleshooting and reduces protocol overhead for faster recovery from failures.

Question 439 - Checked
Which three characteristics are typically associated with the core layer in the Cisco hierarchical network design model? (Choose three.)
A. packet manipulation
B. monitoring of DMZ traffic
C. connectivity to the data center
D. redundant paths
E. rapid forwarding of traffic

Answer: CDE

Explanation
The core layer is the backbone and aggregation point for multiple networks and provides scalability, high availability, and fast convergence to the network. It can provide high-speed connectivity for large enterprises with multiple campus networks distributed worldwide and it can also provide interconnectivity between the end-user/endpoint campus access layer and other network blocks such as the data center, the private cloud, the public cloud, the WAN, Internet edge, and network services. Packet filtering is a function of the distribution layer.

Router connected to three switches, two links per.

Which switching technology would allow each access layer switch link to be aggregated to provide more bandwidth between each Layer 2 switch and the Layer 3 switch?
A. HSRP
B. EtherChannel
C. trunking
D. PortFast

Answer: B

Explanation
PortFast is used to reduce the amount of time that a port spends going through the spanning-tree algorithm, so that devices can start sending data sooner. Trunking can be implemented in conjunction with EtherChannel, but trunking alone does not aggregate switch links. HSRP is used to load-balance traffic across two different connections to Layer 3 devices for default gateway redundancy. HSRP does not aggregate links at either Layer 2 or Layer 3 as EtherChannel does.

School site 1/2 - Core connected to access switches

Which type of Cisco hierarchical LAN design model is used at school site 1?
A. three-tier
B. 7 layer
C. 3 layer
D. two-tier collapsed core

Answer: D

Explanation
In the two-tier collapsed core model, the distribution layer and the core layer are combined into one. The switch that connects the site to the NOC is serving as both a distribution layer switch and a core layer switch. The NOC is designed with other network devices that are not shown, such as the firewall, as part of an Internet edge design.

Question 445
A network engineer has to decide between a Layer 2 Access Layer (STP-based) and a Layer 3 Access Layer (Routed access) campus design option. Which statement must be considered for a decision to be made?
A. The Routed access option is the best cost-effective solution.
B. The STP based access option supports spanning VLANs across multiple access switches, whereas the Routed access option does not.
C. The Routed access option offers easier troubleshooting than the STP-based option.
D. The STP based option does not require FHRP, whereas the Routed access option does.

Answer: C

Explanation
The Routed access design has a number of advantages over the STP-based design:
No FHRP required – no need for FHRP protocols such as HSRP and VRRP.
No STP required – since there are no L2 links to block, this design removes the need for STP.
Easier troubleshooting – It offers common end-to-end troubleshooting tools (such as ping and traceroute).
The Routed access is an excellent design for many environments, but it has the same limitation as the STP-based design, in which it does not support spanning VLANs across multiple access switches. Additionally, it might not be the most cost-effective solution because access layer switches with Layer 3 routing capability might cost more than Layer 2 switches do.

R1# access list 1 deny 172.16.4.0 0.0.0.255
R1# int g0/0
R1# ip access group 1 out

An ACL was configured on R1 with the intention of denying traffic from subnet 172.16.4.0/24 into subnet 172.16.3.0/24. All other traffic into subnet 172.16.3.0/24 should be permitted. This standard ACL was then applied outbound on interface G0/0/0. Which conclusion can be drawn from this configuration?​
A. An extended ACL must be used in this situation.
B. Only traffic from the 172.16.4.0/24 subnet is blocked, and all other traffic is allowed.​
C. The ACL should be applied outbound on all interfaces of R1.

What mechanism does PIM use to forward multicast traffic?
A. PIM sparse mode uses a pull model to deliver multicast traffic
B. PIM dense mode uses a pull model to deliver multicast traffic
C. PIM sparse mode uses receivers to register with the RP
D. PIM sparse mode uses a flood and prune model to deliver multicast traffic

Answer: A 

Explanation
PIM dense mode (PIM-DM) uses a push model to flood multicast traffic to every corner of the network. This push model is a brute-force method of delivering data to the receivers. This method would be efficient in certain deployments in which there are active receivers on every subnet in the network. PIM-DM initially floods multicast traffic throughout the network. Routers that have no downstream neighbors prune the unwanted traffic. This process repeats every 3 minutes.
PIM Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) uses a pull model to deliver multicast traffic. Only network segments with active receivers that have explicitly requested the data receive the traffic. PIM-SM distributes information about active sources by forwarding data packets on the shared tree. Because PIM-SM uses shared trees (at least initially), it requires the use of an RP. The RP must be administratively configured in the network.
Answer C seems to be correct but it is not, PIM spare mode uses sources (not receivers) to register with the RP. Sources register with the RP, and then data is forwarded down the shared tree to the receivers.

An engineer is using XML in an application to send information to a RESTCONF enabled device. After sending the request, the engineer gets this response message and a HTTP response code of 400. What do these responses tell the engineer?
A. The Accept header sent was application/xml
B. POST was used instead of PUT to update
C. The Content-Type header sent was application/xml.
D. JSON body was used

Answer: A

Explanation
Accept and Content-type are both headers sent from a client (a browser) to a service. Accept header is a way for a client to specify the media type of the response content it is expecting and Contenttype is a way to specify the media type of request being sent from the client to the server.
The response was sent in XML so we can say the Accept header sent was application/xml.

Which statement about LISP encapsulation in an EIGRP OTP implementation is true?
A. LISP learns the next hop
B. OTP uses LISP encapsulation to obtain routes from neighbors
C. OTP uses LISP encapsulation for dynamic multipoint tunneling
D. OTP maintains the LISP control plane

Answer: C

Explanation
The EIGRP Over the Top solution can be used to ensure connectivity between disparate EIGRP sites.
This feature uses EIGRP on the control plane and Locator ID Separation Protocol (LISP) encapsulation on the data plane to route traffic across the underlying WAN architecture. EIGRP is used to distribute routes between customer edge (CE) devices within the network, and the traffic forwarded across the WAN architecture is LISP encapsulated.
EIGRP OTP only uses LISP for the data plane, EIGRP is still used for the control plane. Therefore we cannot say OTP uses LISP encapsulation for dynamic multipoint tunneling as this requires encapsulating both data and control plane traffic -> Answer ‘OTP uses LISP encapsulation for dynamic multipoint tunneling’ is not correct.
In OTP, EIGRP serves as the replacement for LISP control plane protocols (therefore EIGRP will learn the next hop, not LISP -> Answer ‘LISP learns the next hop’ is not correct). Instead of doing dynamic EID-to-RLOC mappings in native LISP-mapping services, EIGRP routers running OTP over a service provider cloud create targeted sessions, use the IP addresses provided by the service provider as RLOCs, and exchange routes as EIDs. Let’s take an example:
CCIE/CCNP 350-401 ENCOR Dumps Full Questions with VCE & PDF 56
If R1 and R2 ran OTP to each other, R1 would learn about the network 10.0.2.0/24 from R2 through EIGRP, treat the prefix 10.0.2.0/24 as an EID prefix, and take the advertising next hop 198.51.100.62 as the RLOC for this EID prefix. Similarly, R2 would learn from R1 about the network 10.0.1.0/24 through EIGRP, treat the prefix 10.0.1.0/24 as an EID prefix, and take the advertising next hop 192.0.2.31 as the RLOC for this EID prefix. On both routers, this information would be used to populate the LISP mapping tables. Whenever a packet from 10.0.1.0/24 to 10.0.2.0/24 would arrive at R1, it would use its LISP mapping tables just like in ordinary LISP to discover that the packet has to be LISP encapsulated and tunneled toward 198.51.100.62, and vice versa. The LISP data plane is reused in OTP and does not change; however, the native LISP mapping and resolving mechanisms are replaced by EIGRP.

A. network 20.1.1.2.0.0.0.0 area 0
B. network 20.1.1.2 255.255.0.0. area 0
C. network 20.1.1.2.0.0.255.255 area 0
D. network 20.1.1.2 255.255.255 area 0

Answer: A

Explanation
The network 20.0.0.0 0.0.0.255 area (” command on R2 did not cover the IP address of Fal/1 interface of R2 so OSPF did not run on this interface. Therefore we have to use the command “network 20.1.1.2 0.0.255.255 area 0” to turn on OSPF on this interface.
Note: The command “network 20.1.1.2 0.0.255.255 area 0” can be used too so this answer is also correct but answer C is the best answer here.
The network 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255 area 0 command on R1 will run OSPF on all active interfaces of R1.

Which two statements about VRF-lite are true? (Choose two)
A. It can support multiple customers on a single switch
B. It supports most routing protocols, including EIGRP, ISIS, and OSPF
C. It should be used when a customer’s router is connected to an ISP over OSPF
D. It can increase the packet switching rate
E. It supports MPLS-VRF label exchange and labeled packets

Answer: AC

Explanation
VRF-lite does not support IGRP and ISIS.
•VRF-lite does not support all MPLS-VRF functionality: label exchange, LDP adjacency, or labeled packets.
•VRF-lite does not affect the packet switching rate.
•The capability vrf-lite subcommand under router ospf should be used when configuring OSPF as the routing protocol between the PE and the CE.

How are the Cisco Express Forwarding table and the FIB related to each other?
A. Cisco Express Forwarding uses a FIB to make IP destination prefix-based switching decisions correct
B. The FIB is used to populate the Cisco Express Forwarding table
C. There can be only one FIB but multiple Cisco Express Forwarding tables on IOS devices
D. The Cisco Express Forwarding table allows route lookups to be forwarded to the route processor for processing before they are sent to the FIB

Answer: A

Explanation
The Forwarding Information Base (FIB) table – CEF uses a FIB to make IP destination prefix basedswitching decisions. The FIB is conceptually similar to a routing table or information base. It maintains a mirror image of the forwarding information contained in the IP routing table. When routing or topology changes occur in the network, the IP routing table is updated, and these changes are reflected in the FIB. The FIB maintains next-hop address information based on the information in the IP routing table.

Both: F0/14
Dest Ports: F0/15
Encap: Native

An engineer configures monitoring on SW1 and enters the show command to verify operation. What does the output confirm?
A. SPAN session 1 monitors activity on VLAN 50 of a remote switch
B. SPAN session 2 only monitors egress traffic exiting port FastEthernet 0/14.
C. SPAN session 2 monitors all traffic entering and exiting port FastEthernet 0/15.
D. RSPAN session 1 is incompletely configured for monitoring

Answer: D

Explanation
SW1 has been configured with the following commands:
SW1(config)#monitor session 1 source remote vlan 50
SW1(config)#monitor session 2 source interface fa0/14
SW1(config)#monitor session 2 destination interface fa0/15
The session 1 on SW1 was configured for Remote SPAN (RSPAN) while session 2 was configured for local SPAN. For RSPAN we need to configure the destination port to complete the configuration.
Note: In fact we cannot create such a session like session 1 because if we only configure Source RSPAN VLAN 50 (with the command monitor session 1 source remote vlan 50) then we will receive a Type: Remote Source Session (not Remote Destination Session).

Question 153. 
Which EIGRP feature allows the use of leak maps?
A. neighbor
B. stub
C. offset-list
D. address-family

Answer: B

Explanation
If we configured an EIGRP stub router so that it only advertises connected and summary routes.
But we also want to have an exception to this rule then we can configure a leak-map. For example:
R4(config-if)#router eigrp 1
R4(config-router)#eigrp stub
R4(config)#ip access-list standard R4_L0opback0
R4(config-std-nacl)#permit host 4.4.4.4
R4(config)#route-map R4_L0opback0_LEAKMAP
R4(config-route-map)#match ip address R4_L0opback0
R4(config)#router eigrp 1
R4(config-router)#eigrp stub leak-map
As we can see the leak-map feature goes long with ‘eigrp stub’ command.

Which two LISP infrastructure elements are needed to support LISP to non-LISP internetworking? (Choose two)
A. PETR
B. PITR
C. MR
D. MS
E. ALT

Answer: AC

Explanation
In this question we suppose that we only need to send packets from LISP site to non-LISP site successfully. We don‘t care about the way back (if we care about the way back then all PETR, PITR, MS & MR are needed).
Proxy Egress Tunnel Router (PETR): A LISP device that de-encapsulates packets from LISP sites to deliver them to non-LISP sites.

When the xTR in LISP Site 1 want to sends traffic to Non-LISP site, the ITR (not PETR) needs a Map Resolver (MR) to send Map Request to. When the ITR (the xTR in LISP Site 1 in the figure above) receives negative MAP-Reply packet from MR, it caches that prefix and map it to the PETR.

An engineer must create a configuration that executes the show run command and then terminates the session when user CCNP logs in. Which configuration change is required”
A. Add the access-class keyword to the username command
B. Add the access-class keyword to the aaa authentication command
C. Add the autocommand keyword to the username command
D. Add the autocommand keyword to the aaa authentication command

Explanation
The “autocommand” causes the specified command to be issued automatically after the user logs in. When the command is complete, the session is terminated. Because the command can be any length and can contain embedded spaces, commands using the autocommand keyword must be the last option on the line. In this specific question, we have to enter this line “username CCNP autocommand show running config”.

A. TCP traffic with the URG bit set is allowed
B. TCP traffic with the SYN bit set is allowed
C. TCP traffic with the ACK bit set is allowed

Answer: C

Explanation
The established keyword is only applicable to TCP access list entries to match TCP segments that have the ACK and/or RST control bit set (regardless of the source and destination ports), which assumes that a TCP connection has already been established in one direction only. Let’s see an example below:

Suppose you only want to allow the hosts inside your company to telnet to an outside server but not vice versa, you can simply use an “established” access-list like this:
access-list 100 permit tcp any any established
access-list 101 permit tcp any any eq telnet

Which two statements about Cisco Express Forwarding load balancing are true? (Choose two)
A. Each hash maps directly to a single entry in the RIB
B. It combines the source IP address subnet mask to create a hash for each destination
C. Cisco Express Forwarding can load-balance over a maximum of two destinations
D. It combines the source and destination IP addresses to create a hash for each destination
E. Each hash maps directly to a single entry in the adjacency table

Answer: DE

Explanation
Cisco IOS software basically supports two modes of CEF load balancing: On per-destination or perpacket basis.
For per destination load balancing a hash is computed out of the source and destination IP address (- > Answer ‘It combines the source and destination IP addresses to create a hash for each destination’ is correct). This hash points to exactly one of the adjacency entries in the adjacency table (-> Answer ‘Each hash maps directly to a single entry in the adjacency table’ is correct), providing that the same path is used for all packets with this source/destination address pair. If per packet load balancing is used the packets are distributed round robin over the available paths. In either case the information in the FIB and adjacency tables provide all the necessary forwarding information, just like for nonload balancing operation.
The number of paths used is limited by the number of entries the routing protocol puts in the routing table, the default in IOS is 4 entries for most IP routing protocols with the exception of BGP, where it is one entry. The maximum number that can be configured is 6 different paths -> Answer ‘Cisco Express Forwarding can load-balance over a maximum of two destinations’ is not correct.

Which characteristic distinguishes Ansible from Chef?
A. Ansible lacs redundancy support for the master server. Chef runs two masters in an active/active mode.
B. Ansible uses Ruby to manage configurations. Chef uses YAML to manage configurations.
C. Ansible pushes the configuration to the client. Chef client pulls the configuration from the server.
D. The Ansible server can run on Linux, Unix or Windows. The Chef server must run on Linux or Unix.

Answer: C

Explanation
Ansible works by connecting to your nodes and pushing out small programs, called “Ansible modules” to them. These programs are written to be resource models of the desired state of the system. Ansible then executes these modules (over SSH by default), and removes them when finished.
Chef is a much older, mature solution to configure management. Unlike Ansible, it does require an installation of an agent on each server, named chef-client. Also, unlike Ansible, it has a Chef server that each client pulls configuration from.

Which technology is used to provide Layer 2 and Layer 3 logical networks in the Cisco SD Access architecture?
A. underlay network
B. VPN routing/forwarding
C. easy virtual network
D. overlay network

Answer: D

Explanation
An overlay network creates a logical topology used to virtually connect devices that are built over an arbitrary physical underlay topology.
An overlay network is created on top of the underlay network through virtualization (virtual networks). The data plane traffic and control plane signaling are contained within each virtualized network, maintaining isolation among the networks and an independence from the underlay network.
SD-Access allows for the extension of Layer 2 and Layer 3 connectivity across the overlay through the services provided by through LISP.

Which two commands ensure that DSW1 becomes root bridge for VLAN 10 and 20?
A. spanning-tree mst 1 priority 1
B. spanning-tree mst 1 root primary
C. spanning-tree mstp vlan 10,20 root primary
D. spanning-tree mst vlan 10,20 priority root
E. spanning-tree mst 1 priority 4096

Answer: BE

Explanation
Priority values are 0, 4096, 8192, 12288, 16384, 20480, 24576, 28672, 32768, 36864, 40960, 45056, 49152, 53248, 57344, and 61440. All other values are rejected.
From the second command output (show spanning-tree mst) we learn that MST1 includes VLANs 10 & 20.Therefore if we want DSW1 to become root bridge for these VLANs we need to set the MST 1 region to root ->The command “spanning-tree mst 1 root primary” can do the trick. In fact, this command runs a macro and setsthe priority lower than the current root.
Also we can see the current root bridge for these VLANs has the priority of 32769 (default value + sysid) so wecan set the priority of DSW1 to a specific lower value. But notice that the priority must be a multiple of 4096.

During deployment, a network engineer notices that voice traffic is not being tagged correctly as it traverses the network. Which COS to DSCP map must be modified to ensure that voice traffic is treated properly?
A. COS of 5 to DSCP 46
B. COS of 7 to DSCP 48
C. COS of 6 to DSCP 46
D. COS of 3 to DSCP of 26

Answer: A

Explanation
CoS value 5 is commonly used for VOIP and CoS value 5 should be mapped to DSCP 46. DSCP 46 is defined as being for EF (Expedited Forwarding) traffic flows and is the value usually assigned to all interactive voice and video traffic. This is to keep the uniformity from end-to-end that DSCP EF (mostly for VOICE RTP) is mapped to COS 5.
Note:
+ CoS is a L2 marking contained within an 802.1q tag,. The values for CoS are 0 – 7
+ DSCP is a L3 marking and has values 0 – 63
+ The default DSCP-to-CoS mapping for CoS 5 is DSCP 40

Which two statements about IP SLA are true? (Choose two)
A. It uses NetFlow for passive traffic monitoring
B. It can measure MOS
C. The IP SLA responder is a component in the source Cisco device
D. It is Layer 2 transport-independent
E. It uses active traffic monitoring
F. SNMP access is not supported

Answer: DE

Explanation
IP SLAs allows Cisco customers to analyze IP service levels for IP applications and services, to increase productivity, to lower operational costs, and to reduce the frequency of network outages. IP SLAs uses active traffic monitoring-the generation of traffic in a continuous, reliable, and predictable manner-for measuring network performance.
Being Layer-2 transport independent, IP SLAs can be configured end-to-end over disparate networks to best reflect the metrics that an end-user is likely to experience.

R1 is able to ping the R3 fa0/1 interface. Why do the extended pings fail?
A. The maximum packet size accepted by the command is 1476 bytes.
B. R3 is missing a return route to 10.99.69.0/30
C. R2 and R3 do not have an OSPF adjacency
D. The DF bit has been set

Answer: D

Explanation
If the DF bit is set, routers cannot fragment packets. From the output below, we learn that the maximum MTU of R2 is 1492 bytes while we sent ping with 1500 bytes. Therefore these ICMP packets were dropped.

Answer: A

Explanation
In fact, VRRP has the preemption enabled by default so we don‘t need the vrrp 10 preempt command. The default priority is 100 so we don‘t need to configure it either. But notice that the correct command to configure the virtual IP address for the group is vrrp 10 ip {ipaddress} (not vrrp group 10 ip …) and this command does not include a subnet mask.

What is a Type 1 hypervisor?
A. runs directly on a physical server and depends on a previously installed operating system
B. runs directly on a physical server and includes its own operating system
C. runs on a virtual server and depends on an already installed operating system
D. run on a virtual server and includes its own operating system

Answer: B

Explanation
There are two types of hypervisors: type 1 and type 2 hypervisor.
In type 1 hypervisor (or native hypervisor), the hypervisor is installed directly on the physical server. Then instances of an operating system (OS) are installed on the hypervisor. Type 1 hypervisor has direct access to the hardware resources. Therefore they are more efficient than hosted architectures. Some examples of type 1 hypervisor are VMware vSphere/ESXi, Oracle VM Server, KVM and Microsoft Hyper-V.
In contrast to type 1 hypervisor, a type 2 hypervisor (or hosted hypervisor) runs on top of an operating system and not the physical hardware directly. A big advantage of Type 2 hypervisors is that management console software is not required. Examples of type 2 hypervisor are VMware Workstation (which can run on Windows, Mac and Linux) or Microsoft Virtual PC (only runs on Windows).

MTU has been configured on the underlying physical topology, and no MTU command has been configured on the tunnel interfaces. What happens when a 1500-byte IPv4 packet traverses the GRE tunnel from host X to host Y, assuming the DF bit is cleared?


A. The packet arrives on router C without fragmentation.
B. The packet is discarded on router A
C. The packet is discarded on router B
D. The packet arrives on router C fragmented.

Answer: D

Explanation
Like any protocol, using GRE adds a few bytes to the size of data packets. This must be factored into the MSS and MTU settings for packets. If the MTU is 1,500 bytes and the MSS is 1,460 bytes (to account for the size of the necessary IP and TCP headers), the addition of GRE 24-byte headers will cause the packets to exceed the MTU:
1,460 bytes [payload] + 20 bytes [TCP header]+ 20 bytes [IP header] + 24 bytes [GRE header + IP header] = 1,524 bytes
As a result, the packets will be fragmented. Fragmentation slows down packet delivery times and increases how much compute power is used, because packets that exceed the MTU must be broken down and then reassembled.

Which two options describe possible causes of the error? (Choose two)

A. There is link flapping on the tunnel
B. Incorrect destination IP addresses are configured on the tunnel
C. The tunnel mode and tunnel IP address are misconfigured

E. The tunnel destination is being routed out of the tunnel interface

Answer: DE

Explanation
The %TUN-5-RECURDOWN: Tunnel0 temporarily disabled due to recursive routing error message means that the generic routing encapsulation (GRE) tunnel router has discovered a recursive routing problem. This condition is usually due to one of these causes:
+ A misconfiguration that causes the router to try to route to the tunnel destination address using the tunnel interface itself (recursive routing)

B. VPNv4 is not configured between PE1 and PE3
C. address-family ipv4 vrf is not configured on PE3
D. PE1 will reject the route due to automatic route filtering
E. After you configure route-target import 999:999 for a VRF on PE3, the route will be accepted

Answer: AD

Explanation
Because some PE routers might receive routing information they do not require, a basic requirement is to be able to filter the MP-iBGP updates at the ingress to the PE router so that the router does not need to keep this information in memory.
The Automatic Route Filtering feature fulfills this filtering requirement. This feature is available by default on all PE routers, and no additional configuration is necessary to enable it. Its function is to filter automatically VPN-IPv4 routes that contain a route target extended community that does not match any of the PE’s configured VRFs. This effectively discards any unwanted VPN-IPv4 routes silently, thus reducing the amount of information that the PE has to store in memory -> Answer ‘PE1 will reject the route due to automatic route filtering’ is correct.

Which two statements about EIGRP load balancing are true? (Choose two)
A. Cisco Express Forwarding is required to load-balance across interfaces
B. A path can be used for load balancing only if it is a feasible successor
C. EIGRP supports unequal-cost paths by default
D. Any path in the EIGRP topology table can be used for unequal-cost load balancing
E. EIGRP supports 6 unequal-cost paths

Answer: BE

Explanation
EIGRP provides a mechanism to load balance over unequal cost paths (or called unequal cost load balancing) through the “variance” command. In other words, EIGRP will install all paths with metric < variance * best metric into the local routing table, provided that it meets the feasibility condition to prevent routing loop. The path that meets this requirement is called a feasible successor. If a path is not a feasible successor, it is not used in load balancing.
Note: The feasibility condition states that, the Advertised Distance (AD) of a route must be lower than the feasible distance of the current successor route.

What is the difference between CEF and process switching?
A. CEF processes packets that are too complex for process switching to manage.
B. CEF is more CPU-intensive than process switching.
C. CEF uses the FIB and the adjacency table to make forwarding decisions, whereas process switching punts each packet.
D. Process switching is faster than CEF.

Answer: C

Explanation
“Punt” is often used to describe the action of moving a packet from the fast path (CEF) to the route processor for handling.
Cisco Express Forwarding (CEF) provides the ability to switch packets through a device in a very quick and efficient way while also keeping the load on the router‘s processor low. CEF is made up of two different main components: the Forwarding Information Base (FIB) and the Adjacency Table.
Process switching is the slowest switching methods (compared to fast switching and Cisco Express Forwarding) because it must find a destination in the routing table. Process switching must also construct a new Layer 2 frame header for every packet. With process switching, when a packet comes in, the scheduler calls a process that examines the routing table, determines which interface the packet should be switched to and then switches the packet. The problem is, this happens for the every packet.

Which QoS mechanism will prevent a decrease in TCP performance?
A. Shaper
B. Rate-Limit
C. Policer
D. Fair-Queue
E. WRED
F. LLQ

Answer: E

Explanation
Weighted Random Early Detection (WRED) is just a congestion avoidance mechanism. WRED drops packets selectively based on IP precedence. Edge routers assign IP precedences to packets as they enter the network. When a packet arrives, the following events occur:
The average queue size is calculated.
2. If the average is less than the minimum queue threshold, the arriving packet is queued.
3. If the average is between the minimum queue threshold for that type of traffic and the maximum threshold for the interface, the packet is either dropped or queued, depending on the packet drop probability for that type of traffic.
4. If the average queue size is greater than the maximum threshold, the packet is dropped.
WRED reduces the chances of tail drop (when the queue is full, the packet is dropped) by selectively dropping packets when the output interface begins to show signs of congestion (thus it can mitigate congestion by preventing the queue from filling up). By dropping some packets early rather than waiting until the queue is full, WRED avoids dropping large numbers of packets at once and minimizes the chances of global synchronization. Thus, WRED allows the transmission line to be used fully at all times.
WRED generally drops packets selectively based on IP precedence. Packets with a higher IP precedence are less likely to be dropped than packets with a lower precedence. Thus, the higher the priority of a packet, the higher the probability that the packet will be delivered.

Which IPv6 migration method relies on dynamic tunnels that use the 2002::/16 reserved address space?
A. GRE
B. 6RD
C. 6to4
D. ISATAP

Answer: C

Explanation
6to4 tunnel is a technique which relies on reserved address space 2002::/16 (you must remember this range). These tunnels determine the appropriate destination address by combining the IPv6 prefix with the globally unique destination 6to4 border router’s IPv4 address, beginning with the 2002::/16 prefix, in this format:
2002:border-router-IPv4-address::/48
For example, if the border-router-IPv4-address is 64.101.64.1, the tunnel interface will have an IPv6 prefix of 2002:4065:4001:1::/64, where 4065:4001 is the hexadecimal equivalent of 64.101.64.1. This technique allows IPv6 sites to communicate with each other over the IPv4 network without explicit tunnel setup but we have to implement it on all routers on the path.

How does SSO work with HSRP to minimize network disruptions?
A. It enables HSRP to elect another switch in the group as the active HSRP switch.
B. It ensures fast failover in the case of link failure.
C. It enables data forwarding along known routes following a switchover, white the routing protocol reconverges.
D. It enables HSRP to failover to the standby RP on the same device.

Answer: D

Explanation
SSO HSRP alters the behavior of HSRP when a device with redundant Route Processors (RPs) is configured for stateful switchover (SSO) redundancy mode. When an RP is active and the other RP is standby, SSO enables the standby RP to take over if the active RP fails.
The SSO HSRP feature enables the Cisco IOS HSRP subsystem software to detect that a standby RP is installed and the system is configured in SSO redundancy mode. Further, if the active RP fails, no change occurs to the HSRP group itself and traffic continues to be forwarded through the current active gateway device.

An engineer must configure a ACL that permits packets which include an ACK In the TCP header. Which entry must be Included In the ACL?
A. access-list 110 permit tcp any any eq 21 tcp-ack
B. access-list 10 permit ip any any eq 21 tcp-ack
C. access-list 10 permit tcp any any eq 21 established
D. access-list 110 permit tcp any any eq 21 established

Answer: D

Explanation
The established keyword is only applicable to TCP access list entries to match TCP segments that have the ACK and/or RST control bit set (regardless of the source and destination ports), which assumes that a TCP connection has already been established in one direction only. 

Suppose you only want to allow the hosts inside your company to telnet to an outside server but not vice versa, you can simply use an ― ”established” access-list like this:
access-list 100 permit tcp any any established
access-list 101 permit tcp any any eq telnet
!
interface S0/0
ip access-group 100 in
ip access-group 101 out
Note: Suppose host A wants to start communicating with host B using TCP. Before they can send real data, a three-way handshake must be established first. 

1. First host A will send a SYN message (a TCP segment with SYN flag set to 1, SYN is short for SYNchronize) to indicate it wants to setup a connection with hostB. This message includes a sequence (SEQ) number for tracking purpose. This sequence number can be any 32-bit number (range from 0 to 232) so we use ―”x” to represent it.
2. After receiving SYN message from host A, host B replies with SYN-ACK message (some books may call it ―SYN/ACK‖ or ―SYN, ACK‖ message. ACK is short for ACKnowledge). This message includes a SYN sequence number and an ACK number:
+ SYN sequence number (let‘s called it “y”) is a random number and does not have any relationship with Host A‘s SYN SEQ number.
+ ACK number is the next number of Host A‘s SYN sequence number it received, so we represent it with “x+1″. It means ―I received your part. Now send me the next part (x + 1)”.
The SYN-ACK message indicates host B accepts to talk to host A (via ACK part). And ask if host A still wants to talk to it as well (via SYN part).
3. After Host A received the SYN-ACK message from host B, it sends an ACK message with ACK number “y+1” to hostB. This confirms host A still wants to talk to hostB.

B. onboard vEdge nodes into the SD-WAN fabric
C. gather telemetry data from yEdge routers
D. distribute policies that govern data forwarding performed within the SD-WAN fabric

Answer: D

Explanation
Control plane (vSmart) builds and maintains the network topology and make decisions on the traffic flows. The vSmart controller disseminates control plane information between WAN Edge devices, implements control plane policies and distributes data plane policies to network devices for enforcement.

+ Orchestration plane (vBond) assists in securely onboarding the SD-WAN WAN Edge routers into the SD-WAN overlay (-> Therefore answer “onboard vEdge nodes into the SD-WAN fabric” mentioned about vBond). The vBond controller, or orchestrator, authenticates and authorizes the SD-WAN components onto the network. The vBond orchestrator takes an added responsibility to distribute the list of vSmart and vManage controller information to the WAN Edge routers. vBond is the only device in SD-WAN that requires a public IP address as it is the first point of contact and authentication for all SD-WAN components to join the SD-WAN fabric. All other components need to know the vBond IP or DNS information.
+ Management plane (vManage) is responsible for central configuration and monitoring. The vManage controller is the centralized network management system that provides a single pane of glass GUI interface to easily deploy, configure, monitor and troubleshoot all Cisco SD-WAN components in the network. (-> Answer “manage, maintain, and gather configuration and status for nodes within the SD-WAN fabric” and answer “gather telemetry data from vEdge routers” are about vManage)
+ Control plane (vSmart) builds and maintains the network topology and make decisions on the traffic flows.

Using the EIRP formula, what parameter is subtracted to determine the EIRP value?
A. transmitter power
B. antenna cable loss
C. antenna gain
D. signal-to-noise ratio

Answer: B

Explanation
Once you know the complete combination of transmitter power level, the length of cable, and the antenna gain, you can figure out the actual power level that will be radiated from the antenna. This is known as the effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP), measured in dBm.
EIRP is a very important parameter because it is regulated by governmental agencies in most countries. In those cases, a system cannot radiate signals higher than a maximum allowable EIRP. To find the EIRP of a system, simply add the transmitter power level to the antenna gain and subtract the cable loss.

Which two sources cause interference for Wi-Fi networks? (Choose two).
A. mirrored wall
B. 900MHz baby monitor
C. fish tank
D. DECT 6.0 cordless
E. Incandesent lights

Answer: AC

Explanation
Windows can actually block your WiFi signal. How? Because the signals will be reflected by the glass.
Some new windows have transparent films that can block certain wave types, and this can make it harder for your WiFi signal to pass through.
Tinted glass is another problem for the same reasons. They sometimes contain metallic films that can completely block out your signal. Mirrors, like windows, can reflect your signal. They’re also a source of electromagnetic interference because of their metal backings.
Reference: https://dis-dot-dat.net/what-materials-can-block-a-wifi-signal/ An incandescent light bulb, incandescent lamp or incandescent light globe is an electric light with a wire filament heated until it glows. WiFi operates in the gigahertz microwave band. The FCC has strict regulations on RFI (radio frequency interference) from all sorts of things, including light bulbs -> Incandesent lights do not interfere Wi-Fi networks.
Note:
+ Many baby monitors operate at 900MHz and won’t interfere with Wi-Fi, which uses the 2.4GHz band. + DECT cordless phone 6.0 is designed to eliminate wifi interference by operating on a different
frequency.
There is essentially no such thing as DECT wifi interference.

C. The EIGRP metric Is calculated based on bandwidth and delay. The OSPF metric is calculated on bandwidth only.
D. The EIGRP metric Is calculated based on hop count and bandwidth. The OSPF metric is calculated on bandwidth and delay.

Answer: C

Explanation
By default, EIGRP metric is calculated:
metric = bandwidth + delay
While OSPF is calculated by:
OSPF metric = Reference bandwidth / Interface bandwidth in bps
(Or Cisco uses 100Mbps (108) bandwidth as reference bandwidth. With this bandwidth, our equation would be:

After an engineer configures an EtherChannel between switch SW1 and switch SW2, this error message is logged on switch SW2.

SW2#
08:33:23: %PM-4-ERR_DISABLE: channel-misconfig error detection on Gi0/0, putting
(Gi0/0 in err-disable state
08:33:23: %PM-4-ERR_ DISABLE: channel-misconfig error detection on Gi0/1, putting
Gi0/1 in err-disable state

Based on the output from SW1 and the log message received on Switch SW2, what action should the engineer take to resolve this issue?
A. Configure the same protocol on the EtherChannel on switch SW1 and SW2.
B. Connect the configuration error on interface Gi0/1 on switch SW1.
C. Define the correct port members on the EtherChannel on switch SW1.
D. Correct the configuration error on interface Gi0/0 switch SW1.

Answer: A

Explanation
In this case, we are using your EtherChannel without a negotiation protocol. As a result, if the opposite switch is not also configured for EtherChannel operation on the respective ports, there is a danger of a switching loop. The EtherChannel Misconfiguration Guard tries to prevent that loop from occuring by disabling all the ports bundled in the EtherChannel.

A. monitor session 1 source interface port-channel 6
B. monitor session 1 source vlan 10
C. monitor session 1 source interface FastEthernet0/1 rx
D. monitor session 1 source interface port-channel 7, port-channel 8

Answer: B

Explanation
A monitor session can source from interfaces or VLANs – not both at the same time.
RSPAN consists of at least one RSPAN source session, an RSPAN VLAN, and at least one RSPAN destination session. You separately configure RSPAN source sessions and RSPAN destination sessions on different network devices. To configure an RSPAN source session on a device, you associate a set of source ports or source VLANs with an RSPAN VLAN.
Traffic monitoring in a SPAN session has these restrictions:
+ Sources can be ports or VLANs, but you cannot mix source ports and source VLANs in the same session.
Reference: Here
Therefore in this question, we cannot configure a source VLAN because we configured source ports for RSPAN session 1 already.

Question 245. 
Which entity is responsible for maintaining Layer 2 isolation between segments In a VXLAN environment?
A. switch fabric
B. VTEP
C. VNID
D. host switch

Answer: C

Explanation
VXLAN uses an 8-byte VXLAN header that consists of a 24-bit VNID and a few reserved bits. The VXLAN header together with the original Ethernet frame goes in the UDP payload.
The 24-bit VNID is used to identify Layer 2 segments and to maintain Layer 2 isolation between the segments.

The key fields for the VXLAN packet in each of the protocol headers are:
+ Outer MAC header (14 bytes with 4 bytes optional) – Contains the MAC address of the source VTEP and the MAC address of the next-hop router. Each router along the packet‘s path rewrites this header so that the source address is the router‘s MAC address and the destination address is the next-hop router‘s MAC address.
+ Outer IP header (20 bytes)- Contains the IP addresses of the source and destination VTEPs.
+ (Outer) UDP header (8 bytes)- Contains source and destination UDP ports:
– Source UDP port: The VXLAN protocol repurposes this standard field in a UDP packet header. Instead of using this field for the source UDP port, the protocol uses it as a numeric identifier for the particular flow between VTEPs. The VXLAN standard does not define how this number is derived, but the source VTEP usually calculates it from a hash of some combination of fields from the inner Layer 2 packet and the Layer 3 or Layer 4 headers of the original frame.
– Destination UDP port: The VXLAN UDP port. The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) allocates port 4789 to VXLAN.
+ VXLAN header (8 bytes)- Contains the 24-bit VNI (or VNID)
+ Original Ethernet/L2 Frame – Contains the original Layer 2 Ethernet frame.

An engineer is installing a new pair of routers in a redundant configuration. When checking on the standby status of each router the engineer notices that the routers are not functioning as expected. Which action will resolve the configuration error?
A. configure matching hold and delay timers
B. configure matching key-strings
C. configure matching priority values
D. configure unique virtual IP addresses

Answer: B

Explanation
From the output exhibit, we notice that the key-string of R1 is “Cisco123!” (letter “C”is in capital) while that of R2 is “cisco123!”. This causes a mismatch in the authentication so we have to fix their key-strings.
Note: key-string [encryption-type] text-string: Configures the text string for the key. The textstring argument is alphanumeric, case-sensitive, and supports special characters.

Question 247.  - Checked
When reason could cause an OSPF neighborship to be in the EXSTART/EXCHANGE state?
A. Mismatched OSPF network type
B. Mismatched areas
C. Mismatched MTU size
D. Mismatched OSPF link costs

Answer: C

Explanation
When OSPF adjacency is formed, a router goes through several state changes before it becomes fully adjacent with its neighbor. The states are Down -> Attempt (optional) -> Init -> 2-Way -> Exstart -> Exchange -> Loading -> Full. Short descriptions about these states are listed below:
Down: no information (hellos) has been received from this neighbor.
Attempt: only valid for manually configured neighbors in an NBMA environment. In Attempt state, the router sends unicast hello packets every poll interval to the neighbor, from which hellos have not been received within the dead interval.
Init: specifies that the router has received a hello packet from its neighbor, but the receiving router’s ID was not included in the hello packet
2-Way: indicates bi-directional communication has been established between two routers.
Exstart: Once the DR and BDR are elected, the actual process of exchanging link state information can start between the routers and their DR and BDR.
Exchange: OSPF routers exchange database descriptor (DBD) packets
Loading: In this state, the actual exchange of link state information occurs Full: routers are fully adjacent with each other (Reference:
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk365/technologies_tech_note09186a0080093f0e.shtml)
Neighbors Stuck in Exstart/Exchange State the problem occurs most frequently when attempting to run OSPF between a Cisco router and another vendor’s router. The problem occurs when the maximum transmission unit (MTU) settings for neighboring router interfaces don’t match. If the router with the higher MTU sends a packet larger that the MTU set on the neighboring router, the neighboring router ignores the packet.

Which router is elected the IGMP Querier when more than one router is in the same LAN segment?
A. The router with the shortest uptime
B. The router with the lowest IP address
C. The router with the highest IP address
D. The router with the longest uptime

Answer: B

Explanation
Query messages are used to elect the IGMP querier as follows:
1. When IGMPv2 devices start, they each multicast a general query message to the allsystems grou address of 224.0.0.1 with their interface address in the source IP address field of the message.
2. When an IGMPv2 device receives a general query message, the device compares the source IP address in the message with its own interface address. The device with the lowest IP address on the subnet is elected the IGMP querier.
3. All devices (excluding the querier) start the query timer, which is reset whenever a general query message is received from the IGMP querier. If the query timer expires, it is assumed that the IGMP querier has gone down, and the election process is performed again to elect a new IGMP querier.

DSW1 -  DSW2 (primary)

Assuming all links are functional, which path does PC1 take to reach DSW1?
A. PC1 goes from ALSW1 to DSW1
B. PC1 goes form ALSW1 to DSW2 to ALSW2 to DSW1
C. PC1 goes from ALSW1 to DSW2 to Core to DSW1
D. PC1 goes from ALSW1 to DSW2 to DSW1

Answer: D

Explanation
In the topology above, we see DSW2 has lowest priority 24576 so it is the root bridge for VLAN 10 so surely all traffic for this VLAN must go through it. All of DSW2 ports must be in forwarding state. And:
+ The direct link between DSW1 and ALSW1 is blocked by STP.
+ The direct link between DSW1 and ALSW2 is also blocked by STP.
Therefore PC1 must go via this path: PC1 -> ALSW1 -> DSW2 -> DSW1.

Question 263. 
A customer has deployed an environment with shared storage to allow for the migration of virtual machines between servers with dedicated operating systems that provide the virtualization platform. What is this operating system described as?
A. hosted virtualization
B. type 1 hypervisor
C. container oriented
D. decoupled

Answer: A

Explanation
Hosted virtualization is type 2 hypervisor. In contrast to type 1 hypervisor, a type 2 hypervisor (or hosted hypervisor) runs on top of an operating system and not the physical hardware directly. A big advantage of Type 2 hypervisors is that management console software is not required. Examples of type 2 hypervisor are VMware Workstation (which can run on Windows, Mac and Linux) or Microsoft Virtual PC (only runs on Windows).

Question 267. 
An engineer has deployed a single Cisco 5520 WLC with a management IP address of 172.16.50.5/24. The engineer must register 50 new Cisco AIR-CAP2802I-E-K9 access points to the WLC using DHCP option 43. The access points are connected to a switch in VLAN 100 that uses the 172.16.100.0/24 subnet. The engineer has configured the DHCP scope on the switch as follows:

Network 172.16.100.0 255.255.255.0
Default router 172.16.100.1
Option 43 ascii 172.16.50.5

The access points are failing to join the wireless LAN controller. Which action resolves the issue?
A. configure option 43 Hex F104.AC10.3205
B. configure option 43 Hex F104.CA10.3205
C. configure dns-server 172.16.50.5
D. configure dns-server 172.16.100.1

Answer: A

Explanation
172.16.50.5 in hex is We will have the answer from this paragraph: “TLV values for the Option 43 suboption: Type + Length + Value. Type is always the suboption code 0xf1. Length is the number of controller management IP addresses times 4 in hex. Value is the IP address of the controller listed sequentially in hex. For example, suppose there are two controllers with management interface IP addresses, 192.168.10.5 and 192.168.10.20. The type is 0xf1. The length is 2 * 4 = 8 = 0x08. The IP addresses translates to c0a80a05 (192.168.10.5) and c0a80a14 (192.168.10.20). When the string is assembled, it yields f108c0a80a05c0a80a14. The Cisco IOS IT Certification Guaranteed, The Easy Way! 81command that is added to the DHCP scope is option 43 hex f108c0a80a05c0a80a14.”
Reference: Click
Therefore in this question the option 43 in hex should be “F104.AC10.3205 (the management IP address of 172.16.50.5 in hex is AC.10.32.05).

ip route 172.16.1.0 255.255.255.0 Vlan20

Answer: A

Explanation
Static routes directly between VRFs are not supported so we cannot configure a direct static route between two VRFs.
The command “ip route vrf Customer1 172.16.1.0 255.255.255.0 172.16.1.1 global” means in VRF Customer1, in order to reach destination 172.16.1.0/24 then we uses the next hop IP address 172.16.1.1 in the global routing table. And the command “ip route 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0 Vlan10” tells the router “to reach 192.168.1.0/24, send to Vlan 10”.

Int is err-disabled because of BPDU

An engineer entered the command no spanning-tree bpduguard enable on interface Fa 1/0/7. What is the effect of this command on Fa 1/0/7?
A. It remains in err-disabled state until the shutdown/no shutdown command is entered in the interface configuration mode.
B. It remains in err-disabled state until the errdisable recovery cause failed-port-state command is entered in the global configuration mode.
C. It remains in err-disabled state until the no shutdown command is entered in the interface configuration mode.
D. It remains in err-disabled state until the spanning-tree portfast bpduguard disable command is entered in the interface configuration mode.

Answer: A

Explanation
Seems someone maybe trying to insert a switch into that port which sends bpdu packets. The port is configured to not allow this so it goes into an error disable mode and shuts the port down. You have to do a shut and no shut on the port to bring it back up. However, it may go down again if the device sending bpdu’s is still active on the port.

what is a benefit of using a Type 2 hypervisor instead of a Type 1 hypervisor?
A. better application performance
B. Improved security because the underlying OS is eliminated
C. Improved density and scalability
D. ability to operate on hardware that is running other OSs

Answer: D

Explanation
There are two types of hypervisors: type 1 and type 2 hypervisor.
In type 1 hypervisor (or native hypervisor), the hypervisor is installed directly on the physical server.
Then instances of an operating system (OS) are installed on the hypervisor. Type 1 hypervisor has direct access to the hardware resources. Therefore they are more efficient than hosted architectures.
Some examples of type 1 hypervisor are VMware vSphere/ESXi, Oracle VM Server, KVM and Microsoft Hyper-V.
In contrast to type 1 hypervisor, a type 2 hypervisor (or hosted hypervisor) runs on top of an operating system and not the physical hardware directly. A big advantage of Type 2 hypervisors is that management console software is not required. Examples of type 2 hypervisor are VMware Workstation (which can run on Windows, Mac and Linux) or Microsoft Virtual PC (only runs on Windows).
Type 1 is more efficient and well performing, it is also more secure than type 2 because the flaws and vulnerabilities that are endemic to Operating Systems are often absent from Type 1, bare metal hypervisors.
Type 1 has better performance, scalability and stability but supported by limited hardware.

A wireless consultant is designing a high-density wireless network for a lecture hall for 1000 students Which antenna type is recommended for this environment?
A. sector antenna
B. dipole antenna
C. parabolic dish
D. omnidirectional antenna

Answer: D

Explanation
Directional antennas Directional antennas come in many different styles and shapes. An antenna does not offer any added power to the signal; it simply redirects the energy it receives from the transmitter. By redirecting this energy, it has the effect of providing more energy in one direction and less energy in all other directions. As the gain of a directional antenna increases, the angle of radiation usually decreases, providing a greater coverage distance but with a reduced coverage angle. Directional antennas include patch antennas and parabolic dishes. Parabolic dishes have a very narrow RF energy path, and the installer must be accurate in aiming these types of antennas at each other.

Omnidirectional antennas An omnidirectional antenna is designed to provide a 360-degree radiation pattern. This type of antenna is used when coverage in all directions from the antenna is required. The standard 2.14-dBi “rubber duck” is one style of omnidirectional antenna. Omnidirectional antenna -> Therefore Omnidirectional antenna is best suited for a high-density wireless network in a lecture hall.

The “exec-timeout” command is used to configure the inactive session timeout on the console port or the virtual terminal. The syntax of this command is:
exec-timeout minutes [seconds]
Therefore we need to use the “exec-timeout 10 0” command to set the user inactivity timer to 600 seconds (10 minutes).

Question 284. 
In a traditional 3 tier topology, an engineer must explicitly configure a switch as the root bridge and exclude it from any further election process for the spanning-tree domain. Which action accomplishes this task?
A. Configure the spanning-tree priority to 32768
B. Configure root guard and portfast on all access switch ports.
C. Configure BPDU guard in all switch-to-switch connections.
D. Configure the spanning-tree priority equal to 0.

Answer: B

Explanation
Root guard does not allow the port to become a STP root port, so the port is always STP-designated. If a better BPDU arrives on this port, root guard does not take the BPDU into account and elect a new STP root. Instead, root guard puts the port into the root-inconsistent STP state which is equal to a listening state. No traffic is forwarded across this port.

In a wireless Cisco SD-Access deployment, which roaming method is used when a user moves from one access point to another on a different access switch using a single WLC?
A. Layer 3
B. inter-xTR
C. auto anchor
D. fast roam

Answer: B

Explanation
SDA RoamingSDA supports two additional types of roaming, which are Intra-xTR and Inter-xTR. In SDA, xTR stands for an access-switch that is a fabric edge node. It serves both as an ingress tunnel router as well as an egress tunnel router.
Intra-xTR
When a client on a fabric enabled WLAN, roams from an access point to another access point on the same access-switch, it is called Intra-xTR. Here, the local client database and client history table are updated with the information of the newly associated access point.
Inter-xTR.
When a client on a fabric enabled WLAN, roams from an access point to another access point on a different access-switch, it is called Inter-xTR.

B. It is in FlexConnect mode and must be connected directly to the fabric border node.
C. It is in local mode an must connected directly to the fabric edge switch.
D. It is in FlexConnect mode and must be connected directly to the fabric edge switch.

Answer: C

Explanation
Fabric mode APs continue to support the same wireless media services that traditional APs support;
apply AVC, quality of service (QoS), and other wireless policies; and establish the CAPWAP control plane to the fabric WLC. Fabric APs join as local-mode APs and must be directly connected to the fabric edge node switch to enable fabric registration events, including RLOC assignment via the fabric WLC. The fabric edge nodes use CDP to recognize APs as special wired hosts, applying special port configurations and assigning the APs to a unique overlay network within a common EID space across a fabric. The assignment allows management simplification by using a single subnet to cover the AP infrastructure at a fabric site.

D. (“Make”:[ “Gocar”, “Model”: “Zoom”], Features”: [“Power Windows”, “Manual Drive”, “Auto AC”]}

Answer: A

Explanation
JSON syntax structure: + uses curly braces {} to hold objects and square brackets [] to hold arrays + JSON data is written as key/value pairs + A key/value pair consists of a key (must be a string in double quotation marks “”), followed by a colon :, followed by a value. For example: “name”:”John” + Each key must be unique + Values must be of type string, number, object, array, boolean or null + Multiple key/value within an object are separated by commas , JSON can use arrays. Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable. For example:
{
“name”:”John”,
“age”:30,
“cars”:[ “Ford”, “BMW”, “Fiat”]
}
In the above example, “cars” is an array which contains three values “Ford”, “BMW” and “Fiat”.
Note: Although our correct answer above does not have curly braces to hold objects but it is still the best choice here.

What is the differences between TCAM and the MAC address table?
A. The MAC address table is contained in CAM ACL and QoS information is stored in TCAM
B. The MAC address table supports partial matches. TCAM requires an exact match
C. Router prefix lookups happens in CAM. MAC address table lookups happen in TCAM.
D. TCAM is used to make Layer 2 forwarding decisions CAM is used to build routing tables

Answer: A

Explanation
When using Ternary Content Addressable Memory (TCAM) inside routers it’s used for faster address lookup that enables fast routing.
In switches Content Addressable Memory (CAM) is used for building and lookup of mac address table that enables L2 forwarding decisions.
Besides Longest-Prefix Matching, TCAM in today’s routers and multilayer Switch devices are used to store ACL, QoS and other things from upper-layer processing.

D. Cisco DNA Center is unable to collect monitoring data in Assurance.
E. Users lose connectivity

Answer: CD

Explanation
If you have Cisco SD-Access implemented and DNA Center becomes unreachable then the wired and wireless network will continue to forward packets as usual. There will be no impact to network performance or behavior. Yes you will be able to SSH / telnet / console into switches and wireless network infrastructure as usual. For the period DNA Center is unreachable, Assurance data will be lost, and you will not be able to make configuration changes to the Cisco SD-Access network.

Question 298. 
Which measure is used by an NTP server to indicate its closeness to the authoritative time source?
A. time zone
B. hop count
C. stratum
D. latency

Answer: C

Explanation
The stratum levels define the distance from the reference clock. A reference clock is a stratum 0 device that is assumed to be accurate and has little or no delay associated with it. Stratum 0 servers cannot be used on the network but they are directly connected to computers which then operate as stratum-1 servers. A stratum 1 time server acts as a primary network time standard.

A stratum 2 server is connected to the stratum 1 server; then a stratum 3 server is connected to the stratum 2 server and so on. A stratum 2 server gets its time via NTP packet requests from a stratum 1 server. A stratum 3 server gets its time via NTP packet requests from a stratum-2 server…

Question 300. 
Which two components are supported by LISP? (choose two )
A. proxy ETR
B. egress tunnel router
C. route reflector
D. HMAC algorithm
E. spoke

Answer: AB

Explanation
An Egress Tunnel Router (ETR) connects a site to the LISP-capable part of a core network (such as the Internet), publishes EID-to-RLOC mappings for the site, responds to MapRequest messages, and decapsulates and delivers LISP-encapsulated user data to end systems at the site.
A LISP proxy ETR (PETR) implements ETR functions on behalf of non-LISP sites. A PETR is typically used when a LISP site needs to send traffic to non-LISP sites but the LISP site is connected through a service provider that does not accept nonroutable EIDs as packet sources. PETRs act just like ETRs but for EIDs that send traffic to destinations at non-LISP sites

Question 301. 
A customer has recently implemented a new wireless infrastructure using WLC-5520S at a site directly next to a large commercial airport Users report that they intermittently lose Wi-Fi connectivity, and troubleshooting reveals it is due to frequent channel changes Which two actions fix this issue? (Choose two)
A. Remove UNII-2 and Extended UNII-2 channels from the 5 Ghz channel list
B. Restore the OCA default settings because this automatically avoids channel interference
C. Disable DFS channels to prevent interference writ) Doppler radar
D. Enable DFS channels because they are immune to radar interference
E. Configure channels on the UNII-2 and the Extended UNII-2 sub-bands of the 5 Ghz band only

Answer: AC

Explanation
In the 5GHz spectrum some of the channels used by 802.11 are subject to Dynamic Frequency Selection (DFS) requirements. This is due to our clients coexistence with other RF technologies such as Maritime, Aviation and Weather RADAR.
Dynamic Frequency Selection (DFS) is the process of detecting radar signals that must be protected against interference from 5.0 GHz (802.11a/h) radios, and upon detection switching the operating frequency of the 5.0 GHz (802.11a/h) radio to one that is not interfering with the radar systems.

Although DFS helps reduce interference with radar systems but “DFS channels” refer to the 5GHz channels that require DFS check. In other words, DFS channels are channels that may interfere with radar signal.
Therefore we should disable these DFS channels -> Answer C is correct.
UNII-2 (5.250-5.350 GHz and 5.470-5.725 GHz) which contains channels 52, 56, 60, 64, 100, 104, 108, 112, 116, 120, 124, 128, 132, 136, and 140 are permitted in the United States, but shared with radar systems.
Therefore, APs operating on UNII-2 channels are required to use Dynamic Frequency Selection (DFS) to avoid interfering with radar signals. If an AP detects a radar signal, it must immediately stop using that channel and randomly pick a new channel.

Spanning tree enabled protocol ieee

What does the output confirm about the switch’s spanning tree configuration?
A. The spanning-tree mode stp ieee command was entered on this switch
B. The spanning-tree operation mode for this switch is PVST.
C. The spanning-tree operation mode for this switch is PVST+.
D. The spanning-tree operation mode for this switch is IEEE

Answer: C

Explanation
The default spanning-tree mode in Cisco switch is PVST+. This spanning-tree mode is based on the IEEE 802.1D standard and Cisco proprietary extensions. PVST+ is same as standard IEEE 802.1D but it runs on each VLAN. In the output we see the line “Spanning tree enabled protocol ieee” under “VLAN 20” so it can say the switch is running in PVST+ mode.

How does EIGRP differ from OSPF?
A. EIGRP is more prone to routing loops than OSPF
B. EIGRP has a full map of the topology, and OSPF only knows directly connected neighbors
C. EIGRP supports equal or unequal path cost, and OSPF supports only equal path cost.
D. EIGRP uses more CPU and memory than OSPF

Answer: C

Explanation
OSPF maintains information about all the networks and running routers in its area. Each time there is a change within the area, all routers need to re-sync their database and then run SPF again. This process makes it more CPU intensive. EIGRP, on the other hand, has triggered and incremental updates. Therefore EIGRP is more efficient in terms of CPU usage and memory.

Question 304. 
What is a characteristic of para-virtualization?
A. Para-virtualization guest servers are unaware of one another
B. Para-virtualization allows direct access between the guest OS and the hypervisor
C. Para-virtualization allows the host hardware to be directly accessed
D. Para-virtualization lacks support for containers

Answer: C

Explanation
Paravirtualization works differently from the full virtualization. It doesn’t need to simulate the hardware for the virtual machines. The hypervisor is installed on a physical server (host) and a guest OS is installed into the environment. Virtual guests aware that it has been virtualized, unlike the full virtualization (where the guest doesn’t know that it has been virtualized) to take advantage of the functions.
In full virtualization, guests will issue a hardware calls but in paravirtualization, guests will directly communicate with the host (hypervisor) using drivers.

What is a characteristic of MACsec?
A. 802.1AE provides encryption and authentication services
B. 802.1AE is bult between the host and switch using the MKA protocol, which negotiates encryption keys based on the master session key from a successful 802 1X session
C. 802.1AE is bult between the host and switch using the MKA protocol using keys generated via the Diffie-Hellman algorithm (anonymous encryption mode)
D. 802.1AE is negotiated using Cisco AnyConnect NAM and the SAP protocol

Answer: B

Explanation
MACsec, defined in 802.1AE, provides MAC-layer encryption over wired networks by using out-ofband methods for encryption keying. The MACsec Key Agreement (MKA) Protocol provides the required session keys and manages the required encryption keys. MKA and MACsec are implemented after successful authentication using the 802.1x Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP-TLS) or Pre Shared Key (PSK) framework.

Question 311. 
What are two characteristics of Cisco SD-Access elements? (Choose two)
A. The border node is required for communication between fabric and nonfabric devices.
B. Fabric endpoints are connected directly to the border node
C. Traffic within the fabric always goes through the control plane node
D. The control plane node has the full RLOC-to-EID mapping database
E. The border node has the full RLOC-to-EID mapping database

Answer: AD

Explanation
There are five basic device roles in the fabric overlay:
+ Control plane node: This node contains the settings, protocols, and mapping tables to provide the endpoint-to-location (EID-to-RLOC) mapping system for the fabric overlay.
+ Fabric border node: This fabric device (for example, core layer device) connects external Layer 3 networks to the SDA fabric.
+ Fabric edge node: This fabric device (for example, access or distribution layer device) connects wired endpoints to the SDA fabric.
+ Fabric WLAN controller (WLC): This fabric device connects APs and wireless endpoints to the SDA fabric.
+ Intermediate nodes: These are intermediate routers or extended switches that do not provide any sort of SD-Access fabric role other than underlay services.

Question 312. 
What is the data policy in a Cisco SD-WAN deployment?
A. list of ordered statements that define node configurations and authentication used within the SDWAN overlay
B. Set of statements that defines how data is forwarded based on IP packet information and specific VPNs
C. detailed database mapping several kinds of addresses with their corresponding location
D. group of services tested to guarantee devices and links liveliness within the SD-WAN overlay

Answer: B

Explanation
Data policy operates on the data plane in the Cisco SD-WAN overlay network and affects how data traffic is sent among Cisco SD-WAN devices in the network. The Cisco SD-WAN architecture defines two types of data policy, centralized data policy, which controls the flow of data traffic based on the IP header fields in the data packets and based on network segmentation, and localized data policy, which controls the flow of data traffic into and out of interfaces and interface queues on the devices.

Question 335.  - Checked
The following system log message is presented after a network administrator configures a GRE tunnel:
%TUN-RECURDOWN: Interface Tunnel 0 temporarily disabled due to recursive routing.
Why is Tunnel 0 disabled?
A. Because dynamic routing is not enabled
B. Because the tunnel cannot reach its tunnel destination
C. Because the best path to the tunnel destination is through the tunnel itself
D. Because the router cannot recursively identify its egress forwarding interface.

Answer: C

Explanation
The %TUN-5-RECURDOWN: Tunnel0 temporarily disabled due to recursive routing error message means that the generic routing encapsulation (GRE) tunnel router has discovered a recursive routing problem. This condition is usually due to one of these causes:
+ A misconfiguration that causes the router to try to route to the tunnel destination address using the tunnel interface itself (recursive routing)
+ A temporary instability caused by route flapping elsewhere in the network

A. real-time threat management to stop DDoS attacks to the core and access networks
B. real-time awareness of users, devices and traffic on the network
C. malware control
D. dynamic threat control for web traffic

Answer: B

Explanation
Cisco Stealthwatch is a comprehensive, network telemetry-based, security monitoring and analytics solution that streamlines incident response through behavioral analysis; detecting denial of service attacks, anomalous behaviour, malicious activity and insider threats. Based on a scalable enterprise architecture, Stealthwatch provides near real-time situational awareness of all users and devices on the network.
Reference: https://www.endace.com/cisco-stealthwatch-solution-brief.pdf
Note: Although answer A seems to be correct but in fact, Stealthwatch does not provide real-time protection for DDoS attack. It just helps detect DDoS attack only.
Stealthwatch aggregates observed network activity and performs behavioral and policy driven analytics against what it sees in order to surface problematic activities. While we don’t position our self as a DDOS solution, we’re going to leverage our analytical capabilities to identify a DDoS attack against an internal host using the WebUI.

B. It uses the multicast routing table to perform the multicast forwarding function.
C. It uses unicast routing information to perform the multicast forwarding function.
D. It uses broadcast routing information to perform the multicast forwarding function.

Answer: C

Explanation
Although PIM is called a multicast routing protocol, it actually uses the unicast routing table to perform the reverse path forwarding (RPF) check function instead of building up a completely independent multicast routing table. Unlike other routing protocols, PIM does not send and receive routing updates between routers.

What is the recommended MTU size for a Cisco SD-Access Fabric?
A. 1500
B. 9100
C. 4464
D. 17914

Answer: B

Explanation
VXLAN adds 50 bytes to the original packet. The common denominator and recommended MTU value available on devices operating in a fabric role is 9100. Network should have a minimum starting MTU of at least 1550 bytes to support the fabric overlay. MTU values between 1550 and 9100 are supported along with MTU values larger than 9100 though there may be additional configuration and limitations based on the original packet size.
MTU 9100 is provisioned as part of LAN Automation. Devices in the same routing domain and Layer 2 domain should be configured with a consistent MTU size to support routing protocol adjacencies and packet forwarding without fragmentation.

Question 348. 
What Is the process for moving a virtual machine from one host machine to another with no downtime?
A. high availability
B. disaster recovery

D. multisite replication

Answer: C

Explanation
Live migration refers to the process of moving a running virtual machine or application between different physical machines without disconnecting the client or application. Memory, storage, and network connectivity of the virtual machine are transferred from the original guest machine to the destination. An example of live migration tool is VMware vSphere vMotion.

Question 349. 
What are two features of NetFlow flow monitoring? (Choose two.)
A. Copies all ingress flow information to an interface
B. Include the flow record and the flow importer
C. Can track ingress and egress information
D. Can be used to track multicast, MPLS, or bridged traffic.
E. Does not required packet sampling on interfaces

Answer: CD

Explanation
The following are restrictions for Flexible NetFlow:
+ Traditional NetFlow (TNF) accounting is not supported.
+ Flexible NetFlow v5 export format is not supported, only NetFlow v9 export format is supported.
+ Both ingress and egress NetFlow accounting is supported.
+ Microflow policing feature shares the NetFlow hardware resource with FNF.
+ Only one flow monitor per interface and per direction is supported.
When configuring NetFlow, follow these guidelines and restrictions:
+ Except in PFC3A mode, NetFlow supports bridged IP traffic. PFC3A mode does not support NetFlow bridged IP traffic.
+ NetFlow supports multicast IP traffic.
The Flexible NetFlow – MPLS Egress NetFlow feature allows you to capture IP flow information for packets that arrive on a router as Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) packets and are transmitted as IP packets.
This feature allows you to capture the MPLS VPN IP flows that are traveling through the service provider

Circular and two bulges

Which type of antenna is show on the radiation patterns?
A. Dipole
B. Yagi
C. Patch
D. Omnidirectional

Answer: A

Explanation
A dipole antenna most commonly refers to a half-wavelength (/2) dipole. The physical antenna (not the package that it is in) is constructed of conductive elements whose combined length is about half of a wavelength at its intended frequency of operation. This is a simple antenna that radiates its energy out toward the horizon (perpendicular to the antenna). The patterns shown are those resulting from a perfect dipole formed with two thin wires oriented vertically along the z axis.

Question 351. 
What is the wireless received signal strength indicator?
A. The value given to the strength of the wireless signal received compared to the noise level
B. The value of how strong the wireless signal Is leaving the antenna using transmit power, cable loss, and antenna gain
C. The value of how much wireless signal is lost over a defined amount of distance
D. The value of how strong a tireless signal is receded, measured in dBm

Answer: D

Explanation
RSSI, or “Received Signal Strength Indicator,” is a measurement of how well your device can hear a signal from an access point or router. It’s a value that is useful for determining if you have enough signal to get a good wireless connection.
This value is measured in decibels (dBm) from 0 (zero) to -120 (minus 120). The closer to 0 (zero) the stronger the signal is which means it’s better, typically voice networks require a -65db or better signal level while a data network needs -80db or better.

What does the number in an NTP stratum level represent?
A. The number of hops it takes to reach the master time server.
B. The number of hops it takes to reach the authoritative time source.
C. The amount of offset between the device clock and true time.
D. The amount of drift between the device clock and true time.

Answer: B

Explanation
NTP uses the concept of a stratum to describe how many hops (routers) away a machine is from an authoritative time source, usually a reference clock. A reference clock is a stratum 0 device that is assumed to be accurate and has little or no delay associated with it. Stratum 0 servers cannot be used on the network but they are directly connected to computers which then operate as stratum-1 servers. A stratum 1 time server acts as a primary network time standard.

Question 357. 
Which controller is capable of acting as a STUN server during the onboarding process of Edge devices?
A. vBond
B. vSmart
C. vManage
D. PNP server

Answer: A

Explanation
vbond-as-stun-server:
Enable Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) to allow the tunnel interface to discover its public IP address and port number when the vEdge router is located behind a NAT (on vEdge routers only).
When you configure this command, vEdge routers can exchange their public IP addresses and port numbers over private TLOCs.
With this configuration, the vEdge router uses the vBond orchestrator as a STUN server, so the router can determine its public IP address and public port number. (With this configuration, the router cannot learn the type of NAT that it is behind.)
No overlay network control traffic is sent and no keys are exchanged over tunnel interface configured to the the vBond orchestrator as a STUN server. However, BFD does come up on the tunnel, and data traffic can be sent on it.

Question 358. 
When does a stack master lose its role?
A. When the priority value of a stack member is changed to a higher value
B. when a switch with a higher priority is added to the stack
C. when the stack master is reset
D. when a stack member fails

Answer: C

Explanation
A stack master retains its role unless one of these events occurs:
The switch stack is reset.*
The stack master is removed from the switch stack.
The stack master is reset or powered off.
The stack master fails.
The switch stack membership is increased by adding powered-on standalone switches or switch stacks.*
In the events marked by an asterisk (*), the current stack master might be re-elected based on the listed factors.
When you power on or reset an entire switch stack, some stack members might not participate in the stack master election. Stack members that are powered on within the same 20-second time frame participate in the stack master election and have a chance to become the stack master. Stack members that are powered on after the 20-second time frame do not participate in this initial election and become stack members. All stack members participate in re-elections. For all powering considerations that affect stack-master elections, see the “Switch Installation” chapter in the hardware installation guide.
The new stack master becomes available after a few seconds. In the meantime, the switch stack uses the forwarding tables in memory to minimize network disruption. The physical interfaces on the other available stack members are not affected during a new stack master election and reset.
After a new stack master is elected and the previous stack master becomes available, the previous stack master does not resume its role as stack master.
As described in the hardware installation guide, you can use the Master LED on the switch to see if the switch is the stack master.

What is the calculation that is used to measure the radiated power of a signal after it has gone through the radio, antenna cable, and antenna?
A. EIRP
B. mW
C. dBm
D. dBi

Answer: A

Explanation
Once you know the complete combination of transmitter power level, the length of cable, and the antenna gain, you can figure out the actual power level that will beradiated from the antenna. This is known as the effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP), measured in dBm. EIRP is a very important parameter because it is regulated by governmental agencies in most countries. In those cases, a system cannot radiate signals higher than a maximum allowable EIRP. To find the EIRP of a system, simply add the transmitter power level to the antenna gain and subtract the cable loss.
Suppose a transmitter is configured for a power level of 10 dBm (10 mW). A cable with 5-dB loss connects the transmitter to an antenna with an 8-dBi gain. The resultingEIRP of the system is 10 dBm – 5 dB + 8 dBi, or 13 dBm.
You might notice that the EIRP is made up of decibel-milliwatt (dBm), dB relative to an isotropic antenna (dBi), and decibel (dB) values. Even though the units appear tobe different, you can safely combine them because they are all in the dB “domain”.

An engineer is concerned with the deployment of a new application that is sensitive to inter-packet delay variance. Which command configures the router to be the destination of jitter measurements?
A. Router(config)# ip sla responder udp-connect 172.29.139.134 5000
B. Router(config)# ip sla responder tcp-connect 172.29.139.134 5000

D. Router(config)# ip sla responder tcp-echo 172.29.139.134 5000

Answer: C

Explanation
Cisco IOS IP SLA Responder is a Cisco IOS Software component whose functionality is to respond to Cisco IOS IP SLA request packets. The IP SLA source sends control packets before the operation starts to establish a connection to the responder. Once the control packet is acknowledged, test packets are sent to the responder. The responder inserts a time-stamp when it receives a packet and factors out the destination processing time and adds time-stamps to the sent packets. This feature allows the calculation of unidirectional packet loss, latency, and jitter measurements with the kind of accuracy that is not possible with ping or other dedicated probe testing.
Reference:
UDP Jitter measures the delay, delay variation (jitter), corruption, misordering and packet loss by generating periodic UDP traffic. This operation always requires IP SLA responder. The command to enable UDP Jitter Operation is “ip sla responder udp-echo {destination-ip-address} [destination-port]

switch2(config)# monitor session 1 destination interface GigabitEthernet1/2

Answer: BE

Explanation
Switch2 is not allowing VLAN 70 which is used on Switch1 for RSPAN
so we must allow it -> Option B is correct (although it would not allow VLAN 81 to 90 to go through).
“An external packet capture device is connected to switch2 interface GigabitEthernet1/2” so we must configure Gi1/2 as the destination port.
For your information, this is how to configure Remote SPAN (RSPAN) feature on two switches. Traffic on FastEthernet0/1 of Switch 1 will be sent to Fa0/10 of Switch2 via VLAN 40.
+ Configure on both switches
Switch1,2(config)#vlan 40
Switch1,2(config-vlan)#remote-span
+ Configure on Switch1
Switch1(config)# monitor session 1 source interface FastEthernet 0/1
Switch1(config)# monitor session 1 destination remote vlan 40
+ Configure on Switch2
Switch2(config)#monitor session 5 source remote vlan 40
Switch2(config)# monitor session 5 destination interface FastEthernet 0/10

What is the function of vBond in a Cisco SDWAN deployment?
A. initiating connections with SD-WAN routers automatically
B. pushing of configuration toward SD-WAN routers
C. onboarding of SDWAN routers into the SD-WAN overlay
D. gathering telemetry data from SD-WAN routers

Answer: C

Explanation
Orchestration plane (vBond) assists in securely onboarding the SD-WAN WAN Edge routers into the SD-WAN overlay. The vBond controller, or orchestrator, authenticates and authorizes the SD-WAN components onto the network. The vBond orchestrator takes an added responsibility to distribute the list of vSmart and vManage controller
 information to the WAN Edge routers. vBond is the only device in SD-WAN that requires a public IP address as it is the first point of contact and authentication for all SD-WAN components to join the SD-WAN fabric. All other components need to know the vBond IP or DNS information.

A. The WLC is connected outside of the fabric
B. The WLC is part of the fabric underlay
C. The access point is connected outside of the fabric.
D. The WLC is part of the fabric overlay.

Answer: A

Explanation
WLC
– WLC is connected outside Fabric (optionally directly to Border)
– WLC needs to reside in global routing table – to talk to CP!
– No need for inter-VRF leaking for AP to join the WLC
– WLC can only belong to one FD. WLC talks to one CP (two for HA)
Access Points
– AP is directly connected to FE (or to an extended node switch)
– AP is part of Fabric overlay
– AP belongs to the INFRA_VN which is mapped to the global routing table (new in DNAC 1.1)
– AP joins the WLC in Local mode

What is a type 2 hypervisor?
A. Installed as an application on an already installed operating system.
B. Runs directly on a physical server and includes its own operating system.
C. Supports over-allocation of physical resources.
D. Also referred to as a “bare metal hypervisor” because it sits directly on the physical server.

Answer: A

Explanation
 There are two types of hypervisors: type 1 and type 2 hypervisor.
 In type 1 hypervisor (or native hypervisor), the hypervisor is installed directly on the physical server. Then instances of an operating system (OS) are installed on the hypervisor. Type 1 hypervisor has direct access to the hardware resources. Therefore they are more efficient than hosted architectures. Some examples of type 1 hypervisor are VMware vSphere/ESXi, Oracle VM Server, KVM and Microsoft Hyper-V.
 In contrast to type 1 hypervisor, a type 2 hypervisor (or hosted hypervisor) runs on top of an operating system and not the physical hardware directly. A big advantage of Type 2 hypervisors is that management console software is not required. Examples of type 2 hypervisor are VMware Workstation (which can run on Windows, Mac and Linux) or
 Microsoft Virtual PC (only runs on Windows).

What are two benefits of virtual switching when compared to hardware switching? (Choose two.)
A. increased MTU size
B. hardware independence
C. VM-level isolation
D. increased flexibility
E. extended 802.1Q VLAN range

Answer: CD

Explanation
 Virtual switches have benefits as well as virtual machines attached to them. They boost security by leveraging isolation, control and content inspection methods between virtual machines, which helps deter inter-switch link attacks.
 Moreover, with virtual switches, network administrators can control them with a hypervisor. Additionally, virtual switches can help with the migration of virtual machines across physical hosts by eliminating the need to reconfigure
 each virtual machine. They can also enhance operational efficiency, improve communications and scale system bandwidth capacity.

What are two characteristics of VXLAN? (Choose two)
A. It uses VTEPs to encapsulate and decapsulate frames.
B. It has a 12-bit network identifier
C. It allows for up to 16 million VXLAN segments
D. It lacks support for host mobility
E. It extends Layer 2 and Layer 3 overlay networks over a Layer 2 underlay.

Answer: AC

Explanation
 VXLAN has a 24-bit VXLAN network identifier (VNI), which allows for up to 16 million (= 224) VXLAN segments to coexist within the same infrastructure. This surely solve the small number of traditional VLANs -> The first problem of VLAN has been resolved.
 VTEPs connect between Overlay and Underlay network and they are responsible for encapsulating frame into VXLAN packets to send across IP network (Underlay) then decapsulating when the packets leaves the VXLAN tunnel.
  VXLAN is a virtual overlay network which runs on the top of a physical underlay network. The underlay network may use any Layer 3 routing protocol like OSPF, EIGRP, IS-IS... to route packets so no Spanning Tree Protocol is required -> One of the major benefits of VXLAN technology is that it allows creating virtual Layer 2 segments over
 Layer 3 routed networks. Therefore answer C is not correct because “It extends Layer 2 and Layer 3 overlay networks over a Layer 3 underlay” (not Layer 2 underlay).

Which features does Cisco EDR use to provide threat detection and response protection?
A. containment, threat intelligence, and machine learning
B. firewalling and intrusion prevention
C. container-based agents
D. cloud analysis and endpoint firewall controls

Answer: A

Explanation
 In addition to continuous file analysis, it is important to note that an EDR is only as good at detecting files as the cyber threat intelligence that powers it. Cyber threat intelligence leverages large-scale data, machine learning capabilities,
 and advanced file analysis to help detect threats. The greater the cyber threat intelligence, the more likely it is your EDR solution will identify the threat. Without any cyber threat intelligence, an EDR solution is ineffective.
 After detecting a malicious file, an EDR solution must be able to contain the threat. Malicious files aim to infect as many processes, applications, and users as possible. Segmentation can be a great defense within your data center to avoid lateral movement of advanced threats. Segmentation is helpful, but a proper EDR solution can help contain a malicious file before testing the edges of segmented areas of the network. Ransomware is a tremendous example of why you need to contain threats. Ransomware can be tricky to remove. Once it has encrypted information, your EDR needs to be able to fully contain ransomware to mitigate the damages.

R2# DUPADDR: Duplicate address 10.10.1.1 on F1/0 sourced by 0000.0c07.ac28

An engineer configures a new HSRP group. While reviewing the HSRP status, the engineer sees the logging message generated on R2. Which is the cause of the message?
A. The same virtual IP address has been configured for two HSRP groups
B. The HSRP configuration has caused a spanning-tree loop
C. The HSRP configuration has caused a routing loop
D. A PC is on the network using the IP address 10.10.1.1

Answer: A

Explanation
 These messages specifically indicate that the router received a data packet that was sourced from the MAC addresses 0000.0c07.ac28, which is different from the MAC address of our HSRP group (0000.0c07.ac32). We also notice that 0000.0c07.ac28 is the virtual MAC address of another HSRP group (group 40 in particular; as 28 in hexadecimal equals to 40 in decimal).
 Note: If the source MAC address of the error message is the same as our HSRP MAC address then the most likely cause is STP loop as our router received its own packet back.

How is Layer 3 roaming accomplished in a unified wireless deployment?
A. An EoIP tunnel is created between the client and the anchor controller to provide seamless connectivity as the client is associated with the new AP.
B. The client entry on the original controller is passed to the database on the new controller.
C. The new controller assigns an IP address from the new subnet to the client
D. The client database on the original controller is updated the anchor entry, and the new controller database is updated with the foreign entry.

Answer: D

Explanation
 An EoIP tunnel is created between the anchor and foreign controller, not between the client and the anchor controller -
 > Answer A is not correct.
 In instances where the client roams between APs that are connected to different WLCs and the WLC WLAN is connected to a different subnet, a Layer 3 roam is performed, and there is an update between the new WLC (foreign WLC) and
 the old WLC (anchor WLC) mobility databases.

 The client begins with a connection to AP B on WLC 1. This creates an ANCHOR entry in the WLC client database (-> Answer D is correct as the client database is marked “ANCHOR”). As the client moves away from AP B and makes an association
 with AP C, WLC 2 sends a mobility announcement to peers in the mobility group looking for the WLC with the client MAC address. WLC 1 responds to the announcement, handshakes, and ACKs. Next the client database entry for the roaming client is copied to WLC 2, and marked as FOREIGN. Included PMK data (master key data from the RADIUS
 server) is also copied to WLC 2. This provides fast roam times for WPA2/802.11i clients because there is no need to re-authenticate to the RADIUS server.
 After a simple key exchange between the client and AP, the client is added to the WLC 2 database and is similar, except that it is marked as FOREIGN.
 Reference: https://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/solutions/Enterprise/Mobility/emob30dg/TechArch.html and https://mr
   ncciew.com/2013/03/17/l3-inter-controller-roaming/
  In Layer 3 roaming, no IP address refresh needed (although client must be re-authenticated and new security session established) -> Answer C is not correct.
 In summary, the “Mobility State” of a client is described below:
 + Before roaming: Mobility State = Local
 + After roaming: Mobility State on Old Database = Anchor; Mobility State on New Database = Foreign
 Therefore the client entry on the original controller is not passed to the database totally. The client entry is still on the old controller but it is marked “Anchor” -> Answer B is not correct.

How is MSDP used to interconnect multiple PIM-SM domains?
A. MSDP depends on BGP or multiprotocol BGP for interdomain operation.
B. MSDP SA request messages are used to request a list of active sources for a specific group
C. MSDP allows a rendezvous point to dynamically discover active sources outside of its domain
D. MSDP messages are used to advertise active sources in a domain

Answer: A

Explanation
 SA request messages are used to request a list of active sources for a specific group. These messages are sent to an MSDP SA cache that maintains a list of active (S, G) pairs in its SA cache -> Answer C is correct.
 SA response messages are sent by the MSDP peer in response to an SA request message. SA response messages contain the IP address of the originating RP and one or more (S, G) pairs of the active sources in the originating RP’s domain that are stored in the cache -> Answer D is not correct as it should be “SA response messages are used to
 advertise active sources in a domain” (not MSDP messages).

  “MSDP depends on BGP or multiprotocol BGP (MBGP) for interdomain operation. We recommended that you run MSDP on RPs sending to global multicast groups.”
 But we think answer C is the better choice because it answers the question “How is MSDP used ...”.
 Note:
 After a large PIM-SM network is divided into multiple PIM-SM domains, a mechanism is required to enable user hosts in a PIM-SM domain to receive multicast data from sources in another PIM-SM domain.
 Multicast Source Discovery Protocol (MSDP) provides such a mechanism. It interconnects multiple PIM-SM domains to implement inter-domain multicast. RPs in PIM-SM domains set up MSDP peer relationships. By sending Source Active (SA) messages, the MSDP peers send the (S, G) information from the RP to which the source registers to the RPs in another PIM-SM domain.
  Reference: https://support.huawei.com/enterprise/en/doc/EDOC1000027471?section=j009
  Note: A benefit of using MSDP to interconnect multiple PIM-SM domains is to allow a rendezvous point (RP) to dynamically discover active sources outside of its domain.

Which new enhancement was implemented in Wi-Fi 6?
A. Wi-Fi Protected Access 3
B. 4096 Quadrature Amplitude Modulation Mode
C. Channel bonding
D. Uplink and Downlink Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access

Answer: D

Explanation
 Wi-Fi 6 brings several crucial wireless enhancements for IT administrators when compared to Wi-Fi 5. The first
 significant change is using 2.4 GHz. Wi-Fi 5 was limited to only using 5 GHz. While 5 GHz is a ‘cleaner’ band of RF, it
 doesn’t penetrate walls and 2.4 GHz and requires more battery life. For Wi-Fi driven IoT devices, 2.4 GHz will likely
 continue to be the band of choice for the foreseeable future.
 Another critical difference between the two standards is the use of Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access
  (OFDMA) and MU-MIMO. Wi-Fi 5 was limited to downlink only on MU-MIMO, where Wi-Fi 6 includes downlink and
   uplink. OFDMA, as referenced above, is also only available in Wi-Fi 6.

C. SaltStack is constructed with minion, whereas Ansible is constructed with YAML
D. SaltStack uses SSH to interact with Cisco devices, whereas Ansible uses an event bus

Answer: C

Explanation
 – Saltstack uses YAML (Python) same as Ansible.
 – Saltstack uses the push model for executing commands via the SSH protocol
 – Ansible only uses SSH, not Telnet.
 In SaltStack architecture, there is a core component called Salt-minion, which is a system that is being controlled by a Salt master.

A network engineer must simplify the IPsec configuration by enabling IPsec over GRE using IPsec profiles. Which two configuration changes accomplish this? (Choose two).
A. Create an IPsec profile, associate the transform-set ACL, and apply the profile to the tunnel interface.
B. Apply the crypto map to the tunnel interface and change the tunnel mode to tunnel mode ipsec ipv4.
C. Remove all configuration related to crypto map from R1 and R2 and eliminate the ACL.
D. Create an IPsec profile, associate the transform-set, and apply the profile to the tunnel interface.
E. Remove the crypto map and modify the ACL to allow traffic between 10.10.0.0/24 to 10.20.0.0/24.

Answer: CD

Explanation
A is wrong, you don’t use a “transform-set ACL”
B is wrong. question states use IPsec profiles. Crypto maps was the old way of doing ipsec tunnels before profiles.
C is correct, need to remove crypto map config or it will cause some confusion if the tunnel profile is applied. Didn’t lab it up, but book references this.
D is correct, all you need to do is create a profile and associate the transform-set to this profile, then apply it to the tunnel. If no transform set was created you would have to create one.
E is wrong, i believe removing crypto map would cause the traffic to flow unencrypted over the tunnel. acl in this case is to match the interesting traffic to be encrypted. it’s denying it.
