Question 1
Which option must be used to support a WLC with an IPv6 management address and 100 Cisco Aironet 2800 Series access points that will use DHCP to register?
A. 43
B. 52
C. 60
D. 82

Answer: B

Explanation
The CAPWAP protocol allows a lightweight access point (AP) to use DHCP to discover a wireless controller to which it is
connected to. Cisco lightweight APs running 8.0 and above support DHCP discovery for both IPv4 and IPv6 networks:
+ IPv4 – Cisco lightweight APs implement DHCP option 43 to supply the IPv4 management interface addresses of the
primary, secondary, and tertiary wireless controllers (see the guide).
+ IPv6 – Cisco lightweight APs implement DHCPv6 option 52 (RFC 5417) to supply the IPv6 management interface
addresses of the primary, secondary, and tertiary wireless controllers.
Reference: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/wireless/controller/technotes/8-0/IPV6_DG.html
This question asks about DHCPv6, not DHCPv4 so Option 52 is the best answer.


Question 2A
Which are related to Cisco Express Forwarding? (Choose two)
A. All forwarding decisions are made in software
B. All packets are switched using hardware
C. The forwarding table is created in advance.
D. The router processor is involved with every forwarding decision

Answer: BC

Explanation
 There are different switching methods to forward IP packets. Here are the different switching options:
 Process switching:
 All packets are examined by the CPU and all forwarding decisions are made in software...very slow!
 Fast switching (also known as route caching):
 The first packet in a flow is examined by the CPU; the forwarding decision is cached in hardware for the next packets in
 the same flow. This is a faster method.
 (CEF) Cisco Express Forwarding (also known as topology based switching):
 Forwarding table created in hardware beforehand. All packets will be switched using hardware. This is the fastest
 method but there are some limitations. Multilayer switches and routers use CEF.

Question 3B
When writing a Python script, what two pieces of code go together for error handling?
A. Open and close
B. Import and from 
C. Try: and except:
D. input() and print()

Answer: C

Explanation

Question 3
An engineer must create a script to append and modify device entries in a JSON-formatted file. The script must work
 as follows:
 • Until interrupted from the keyboard, the script reads in the hostname of a device, its management IP address,
 operating system type, and CLI remote access protocol.
 • After being interrupted, the script displays the entered entries and adds them to the JSON-formatted file, replacing
 existing entries whose hostname matches.
 The contents of the JSON-formatted file are as follows:
      {
   "examplerouter": {
   "ip": "203.0.113.1",
   "os": ios-xe",
   "protocol": "ssh"
   },
   ...
   }


__________________
changedDevices = {}
Try:
__________________
....
__________________(keyboard interrupt, EOFError):
Pass

print(json.dumps(changedDevices, indent=4))
_____________(("devicesData.json", "r+")
Devices = json.load(File)
Devices.update(ChangedDevices)
Json.dump(Devices, File, indent=4)
_______________

Drag and drop the statements onto the blanks within the code to complete the script. Not all options are used.
A. While True:
B. except
C. Import json
D. file.open()
E. file.close()
F. File = open

Answer: CABFE

Explanation

 1. import json
 2. while True:
 3. except
 4. File = open
 5. File.close()

 We tested this code successfully:

  And this is the result:
 
 Note:
 + In Python, “pass” is a null statement. It is usually used as a placeholder.
 + In order to run the code successfully, we must have the “devicesData.json” first with at least one sample.
 + This code runs infinitely with “while True:” so we have to use Keyboard interrupt to exit (Ctrl-C in Windows, for
 example).

Question 4
When using BFD in a network design, which consideration must be made?
A. BFD is used with first hop routing protocols to provide subsecond convergence.
B. BFD is used with NSF and graceful to provide subsecond convergence.
C. BFD is more CPU-intensive than using reduced hold timers with routing protocols.
D. BFD is used with dynamic routing protocols to provide subsecond convergence.

Answer: D

Explanation

Question 5
In which two ways does the routing protocol OSPF differ from EIGRP? (Choose two)
A. OSPF supports only equal-cost load balancing. EIGRP supports unequal-cost load balancing
B. OSPF supports an unlimited number of hops. EIGRP supports a maximum of 255 hops
C. OSPF is distance vector protocol. EIGRP is a link-state protocol
D. OSPF provides shorter convergence time than EIGRP
E. OSPF supports unequal-cost load balancing. EIGRP supports only equal-cost load balancing

Answer: AB

Explanation
 EIGRP supports unequal-cost load balancing via “variance” command -> Answer A is correct while answer E is not correct.
 Answer C is not correct obviously.
 The maximum number of hops that EIGRP will accept is 100 by default, the maximum can be configured to 225 with metric maximum hops -> Answer B is correct.
 Reference: https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/cisco-ios-in/0596008694/re597.html
  The network convergence time is faster than OSPF networks, because EIGRP network can learn the topology information and updates more rapidly -> Answer D is not correct.

Question 17
What is one characteristic of VXLAN?
A. It supports a maximum of 4096 VLANs.
B. It supports multitenant segments.
C. It uses STP to prevent loops in the underlay network.
D. It uses the Layer 2 header to transfer packets through the network underlay.
  
Answer: B
 
Explanation
 VXLAN has a 24-bit VXLAN network identifier (VNI), which allows for up to 16 million (= 224) VXLAN segments to
 coexist within the same infrastructure -> Answer A is not correct.
 VXLAN does not use STP to prevent loops. It uses Equal-Cost Multi-Path (ECMP) links for load sharing and near-instant
 failure recovery -> Answer C is not correct.
 VXLAN offers the following benefits:
 VLAN flexibility in multitenant segments: It provides a solution to extend Layer 2 segments over the underlying
  network infrastructure so that tenant workload can be placed across physical pods in the data center.
 VXLAN uses Layer 3, not Layer 2 header to transfer packets through the underlay -> Answer D is not correct.

The OSPF neighborship fails between two routers. What is the cause of this issue?
A. The OSPF router ID is missing on this router.
B. The OSPF process is stopped on the neighbor router.
C. There is an MTU mismatch between the two routers.
D. The OSPF router ID is missing on the neighbor router.
  
Answer: C
 
Explanation
 Neighbors Stuck in Exstart/Exchange State
 The problem occurs most frequently when attempting to run OSPF between a Cisco router and another vendor’s router.
 The problem occurs when the maximum transmission unit (MTU) settings for neighboring router interfaces don’t match.
 If the router with the higher MTU sends a packet larger that the MTU set on the neighboring router, the neighboring router ignores the packet.

Virtual ip is 10.1.1.1
Active virtual MAC is 0000.0c9f.f001
Local virtual MAC is 0000.0c9f.f001 (vs default)
Hello time 3s, hold time 10 s
Next hello in 0.375s
Authentication MD5, key-string "Cisco"
Preemption enabled, delay min 5s
Active router 10.1.1.2, priority 255 (expires in 9.39s)
Standby is local
Priority 100 (default)
IP redundancy name is "hsrp-F1/0/47-1" (default)
  
An engineer configures HSRP and enters the show standby command. Which two facts about the network environment are derived from the output? (Choose two)
A. The local device has a higher priority than the active router
B. The virtual IP address of the HSRP group is 10.1.1.1
C. If the local device fails to receive a hello from the active router for more than 5 seconds, it becomes the active router
D. The hello and hold timers are set to custom values
E. If a router with a higher IP address and same HSRP priority as the active router becomes available, that router becomes the new active router 5 seconds later
  
Answer: BE
 
Explanation
 The local device has a priority of 100 which is smaller than the active router (priority 255) -> Answer A is not correct.
 From the line “Virtual IP address is 10.1.1.1” we learn answer B is correct.
 The holdtime is 10 seconds so the local router needs to wait 10 seconds before becoming the active router -> Answer
 C is not correct.
 The hello timer of 3 seconds and hold timer of 10 seconds are the default values -> Answer D is not correct.
 Therefore 0nly answer E is left although we cannot say it is totally correct.

 OutFile.close()
C. OutFile = open(“ifaces.json”, “w”)
 OutFile.write(Response.json())
 OutFile.close()
D. OutFile = open(“ifaces.json”, “w”)
 OutFile.write(Response.text)
 OutFile.close()
  
Answer: A
 
Explanation
 Response.text() returns a string so we can write directly to a file. But only “UpdatedConfig” variable contains the
 changed interface so we have to write it to a file.

A. Cisco aWIPS policies on Cisco DNA Center
B. Cisco aWIPS policies on the WLC
C. malicious rogue rules on Cisco DNA Center
D. malicious rogue rules on the WLC
  
Answer: A
 
Explanation
 The Cisco Advanced Wireless Intrusion Prevention System (aWIPS) is a wireless intrusion threat detection and
 mitigation mechanism. The aWIPS uses an advanced approach to wireless threat detection and performance
 management. The AP detects threats and generates alarms. It combines network traffic analysis, network device and
 topology information, signature-based techniques, and anomaly detection to deliver highly accurate and complete
 wireless threat prevention.
 Because the aWIPS functionality is integrated into Cisco DNA Center, the aWIPS can configure and monitor WIPS
 policies and alarms and report threats.

D. RouterB(config)# router ospf 1
 RouterB(config-router)# area 2 range 192.168.36.0 255.255.252.0
  
Answer: D
 
Explanation
 OSPF offers two methods of route summarization:
 1) Summarization of internal routes performed on the ABRs
 2) Summarization of external routes performed on the ASBRs
 1) To summarize routes at the area boundary (ABRs), use the command:
 area area-id range ip-address mask [advertise | not-advertise] [cost cost]
 An internal summary route is generated if at least one subnet within the area falls in the summary address range and the summarized route metric is equal to the lowest cost of all the subnets within the summary address range.
 Interarea summarization can only be done for the intra-area routes of connected areas, and the ABR creates a route to Null0 to avoid loops in the absence of more specific routes.
 2) To summarize external routes on the domain boundary (ASBRs), use the command:
 summary-address {{ip-address mask} | {prefix mask}} [not-advertise] [tag tag]
 The ASBR will summarize external routes before injecting them into the OSPF domain as type 5 external LSAs.

E. R1(config)#control-plane
 R1(config-cp)# service-policy input POLICY-CoPP

Answer: DE
 
Explanation
 In this question, we must understand the difference between exceed-action and violate-action.
 Using a dual token bucket model allows traffic exceeding the normal burst rate (CIR) to be metered as exceeding and
 traffic that exceeds the excess burst rate to be metered as violating traffic.

What are two results of the NAT configuration? (Choose two)
A. R1 is performing NAT for inside addresses and outside address
B. R1 looks at the destination IP address of packets entering S0/0 and destined for inside hosts
C. Packets with a destination of 200.1.1.1 are translated to 10.1.1.1 or .2, respectively
D. A packet that is sent to 200.1.1.1 from 10.1.1.1 is translated to 209.165.201.1 on R1
E. R1 processes packets entering E0/0 and S0/0 by examining the source IP address
  
Answer: BD
 
Explanation
 This is Static address translation (static NAT): Allows one-to-one mapping between local and global addresses. Answer
 A is not correct as it is translating between “inside global” and “inside local” addresses so we cannot say it is
 performing NAT for outside address.
 Answer B is correct as if the destination address is 209.165.201.1 or .2 then it will translate to 10.1.1.1 or .2 and
 forward to inside hosts.
 Answer D is correct as all packets sent from 10.1.1.1 and .2 to outside are translated to 209.165.201.1 and .2.
 Note: The locations of “Inside”, “Outside” and “Serial0/0” text in the exhibit above are not correct.

Question 38
How do the RIB and the FIB differ?
A. FIB contains routes learned through a dynamic routing protocol, and the RIB contains routes that are static or
 directly connected.
B. RIB contains the interface for a destination, and the FIB contains the next hop information.
C. FIB is derived from the control plane, and the RIB is derived from the data plane.
D. RIB is derived from the control plane, and the FIB is derived from the RIB.
  
Answer: D
 
Explanation
 Each routing protocol like OSPF, EIGRP has its own Routing information base (RIB) and they select their best candidates to try to install to global RIB so that it can then be selected for forwarding. In order to view the RIB table, use the command “show ip ospf database” for OSPF, “show ip eigrp topology” for EIGRP or “show ip bgp” for BGP. To view the Forwarding Information Base (FIB), use the “show ip cef” command. RIB is in Control plane while FIB is in Data plane.
 The Forwarding Information Base (FIB) contains destination reachability information as well as next hop information.
 This information is then used by the router to make forwarding decisions. The FIB allows for very efficient and easy lookups. Below is an example of the FIB table:
  The FIB maintains next-hop address information based on the information in the IP routing table (RIB). In other words, FIB is a mirror copy of RIB.
 RIB is in Control plane (and it is not used for forwarding) while FIB is in Data plane (and it is used for forwarding).
 
Question 39
What does a YANG model provide?
A. standardized data structure independent of the transport protocols
B. creation of transport protocols and their interaction with the OS
C. user access to interact directly with the CLI of the device to receive or modify network configurations
D. standardized data structure that can be used only with NETCONF or RESTCONF transport protocols
 
Answer: A
 
Explanation
 YANG (Yet Another Next Generation) is protocol independent, and YANG data models can be used independent of the  transport or RPC protocol and can be converted into any encoding format supported by the network configuration  protocol.
 Reference: https://www.juniper.net/documentation/us/en/software/junos/netconf/topics/concept/netconf-yang-overview.html
  Currently YANG can be used by NETCONF, RESTCONF and gRPC.
 
Question 40
A network engineer must configure a switch to allow remote access for all feasible protocols. Only a password must be requested for device authentication and all idle sessions must be terminated in 30 minutes. Which configuration must be applied?
A. line vty 0 15
 password cisco
 transport input all
 exec-timeout 0 30

B. line console 0
 password cisco
 exec-timeout 30 0

C. line vty 0 15
 password cisco
 transport input telnet ssh
 exec-timeout 30 0

D. username cisco privilege 15 cisco
 line vty 0 15
 transport input telnet ssh
 login local
 exec-timeout 0 30
  
Answer: C
 
Explanation
 The “exec-timeout” command is used to configure the inactive session timeout on the console port or the virtual terminal. The syntax of this command is:
 exec-timeout minutes [seconds]
 Therefore we need to use the “exec-timeout 30 0” command to set the user inactivity timer to 30 minutes.

If AP power level is increased from 25 mW to 100 mW, what is the power difference in dBm?
A. 6 dBm
B. 14 dBm
C. 17 dBm
D. 20 dBm
 
Answer: A
 
Explanation
 3 dB of gain = +3 dB = doubles signal strength (Let’s say, the base is P. So 10*log10(P/P)= 0 dB and 10*log10(2P/P) = 10*log10(2) = 3dB -> double signal)
 
Question 46
When does a Cisco StackWise primary switch lose its role?
A. when the priority value of a stack member is changed to a higher value
B. when a switch with a higher priority is added to the stack
C. when the stack primary is reset
D. when a stack member fails
  
Answer: C
 
Explanation
 The new priority value takes effect immediately but does not affect the current active switch. The new priority value helps determine which stack member is elected as the new active switch when the current active switch or the switch stack resets -> Answer A is not correct while answer C is correct.

A. CISCO.CONTROLLER.localdomain
B. CISCO.CAPWAP.CONTROLLER.localdomain
C. CISCO-CONTROLLER.localdomain
D. CISCO-CAPWAP-CONTROLLER.localdomain
  
Answer: D

Explanation
 The AP will attempt to resolve the DNS name CISCO-CAPWAP-CONTROLLER.localdomain. When the AP is able to resolve this name to one or more IP addresses, the AP sends a unicast CAPWAP Discovery Message to the resolved IP address(es). Each WLC that receives the CAPWAP Discovery Request Message replies with a unicast CAPWAP Discovery
 Response to the AP.

Question 49
Which NTP mode must be activated when using a Cisco router as an NTP authoritative server?
A. primary
B. server
C. broadcast client
D. peer
  
Answer: B
 
Explanation
 Cisco routers and switches can use 3 different NTP modes:
 NTP client mode.
 NTP server mode.
 NTP symmetric active mode.
 The symmetric active mode is used between NTP devices to synchronize with each other, it’s used as a backup mechanism when they are unable to reach the (external) NTP server.
 The NTP server can operate in master mode to serve time using the local clock, when it has lost synchronization.

Which signal strength and noise values meet the minimum SNR for voice networks?
A. signal strength -67 dBm, noise 91 dBm
B. signal strength -69 dBm, noise 94 dBm
C. signal strength -68 dBm, noise 89 dBm
D. signal strength -66 dBm, noise 90 dBm
  
Answer: B
 
Explanation
 The recommended minimum SNR for voice applications on wireless networks is 25dB. The noise should be in negative number so if the question says “noise 91 dBm” we should understand: N = -91 dBm.
 If your SNR measurements are already in decibel form, then you can subtract the noise quantity from the desired signal: SNR = S – N. This is because when you subtract logarithms, it is the equivalent of dividing normal numbers.
 Also, the difference in the numbers equals the SNR. In this question, only “signal strength -69 dBm, noise 94 dBm” has SNR = -69 – (-94) = 25dB which is equal to the recommended minimum SNR for voice applications.

Question 54A 
Which of the following are characteristics of Orchestration? (Choose two)
A. designed to install and manage software on existing servers
B. designed to provision the servers
C. immutable infrastructure
D. mutable infrastructure

Answer: BC

Explanation
 Configuration management (CM) tools are great at the config nodes but less good at coordinating complex tasks.
 Orchestration tools tend to leave configuration to specialist tools.
 Traditional server environments are mutable, in that they are changed after they are installed. Administrators are always making tweaks or adding code. CM tools evolved to manage this complexity and bring order to the  configuration and updating of tens to thousands of servers. An immutable infrastructure is one in which servers are
 never modified after they’re deployed. If something needs to be updated or changed, new servers are built afresh from a common template with the desired changes. This is the world of Terraform, where new servers replace the existing servers. This is also the philosophy of containers. With orchestration, immutability is easily applied to servers as they  usually have built-in support for managing the lifecycle of a resource from creation to tearing down.

Question 58
Which technology reduces the implementation of STP and leverages both unicast and multicast?
A. VPC
B. VXLAN
C. VSS
D. VLAN
  
Answer: C
 
Explanation
 A VSS combines a pair of switches into a single network element -> It reduces STP.
 For Layer 3 multicast in the VSS, learned multicast routes are stored in hardware in the standby supervisor engine.
 After a switchover, multicast forwarding continues, using the existing hardware entries.
 Reference: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst6500/ios/15-
  4SY/config_guide/sup6T/15_3_sy_swcg_6T/virtual_switching_systems.pdf
  VXLAN solved Layer 2 STP limitations. VXLAN packets are transferred through the underlying network based on its  Layer 3 header and can take complete advantage of Layer 3 routing, equal-cost multipath (ECMP) routing, and link aggregation protocols to use all available paths.
 VXLAN uses Layer 3 routing so it also supports multicast. Therefore in fact we have two correct answers in this question.

R1 has a BGP neighborship with a directly connected router on interface Gi0/0. Which command set is applied between the iterations of show ip bgp 2.2.2.2?
A. R1(config)#router bgp 65001
 R1(config-router)#neighbor 192.168.50.2 shutdown
B. R1(config)#router bgp 65002
 R1(config-router)#neighbor 192.168.50.2 shutdown
C. R1(config)#ip route 2.2.2.2 255.255.255.255 192.168.50.2
D. R1(config)#no ip route 192.168.50.2 255.255.255.255 Gi0/0
  
Answer: C
 
Explanation
 The only difference between the iterations is “RIB-failure(17)”. But this is not an error. It means that we have another better route for 2.2.2.2 in our routing table so BGP route could not be installed into the routing table. So it may be a static route destined to 2.2.2.2.

Question 66
An engineer applies this EEM applet to a router

Event manager applet Test
Event timer watchdog time 600
Action 1.0 cli command enable
Action 2.0 syslog msg "term exec prompt timestamp
Action 3.0 cli command "ter len 0"
Action 4.0 cli command "show ip arp | in 0005.2342.5342"
Action 5.0 regexp ".*(ARPA).*" $_cli_result
Action 6.0 if $_regexp_result eq 1
Action 7.0 syslog msg $_cli_result
Action 8.0 end

What does the applet accomplish?
A. It checks the MAC address table every 600 seconds to see if the specified address has been learned.
B. It compares syslog output to the MAC address table every 600 seconds and generates an event when no match is found.
C. It compares syslog output to the MAC address table every 600 seconds and generates an event when there is a match.
D. It generates a syslog message every 600 seconds on the status of the specified MAC address.
  
Answer: A
 
Explanation
 First let’s see the output of the “show ip arp” command:
  With the command “show ip arp | in 0005.4278.9866”, the “ARPR” text is only found if this MAC address has been learned in the router.
 Answer D is not correct as the syslog message is only generated if the specific MAC address is found (not every 600 seconds).

A network engineer must log in to the router via the console, but the RADIUS servers are not reachable. Which credentials allow console access?
A. the username “cisco” and the password “cisco123”
B. no username and only the password “test123”
C. no username and only the password “cisco123”
D. the username “cisco” and the password “cisco”
  
Answer: C
 
Explanation
 We tested with GNS3 and the router only requires password “cisco123” configured under line console to authenticate.
 So we can deduce the “password” command under line interface is preferred over “login authentication” command.
 
Question 4
A customer transitions a wired environment to a Cisco SD-Access solution. The customer does not want to integrate the wireless network with the fabric. Which wireless deployment approach enables the two systems to coexist and meets the customer requirement?
A. Deploy a separate network for the wireless environment.
B. Implement a Cisco DNA Center to manage the two networks.
C. Deploy the wireless network over the top of the fabric.
D. Deploy the APs in autonomous mode.
  
Answer: C
 
Explanation
 Customers with a wired network based on SD-Access fabric have two options for integrating wireless access:
 + SD-Access Wireless Architecture
 + Cisco Unified Wireless Network Wireless Over the Top (OTT)
 OTT basically involves running traditional wireless on top of a fabric wired network.
 Why would you deploy Cisco Unified Wireless Network wireless OTT? There are two primary reasons:
 ...
 2. Another reason for deploying wireless OTT could be that customer doesn’t want or cannot migrate to fabric for wireless.

Question 5
Which two solutions are used for backing up a Cisco DNA Center Assurance database? (Choose two)
A. NFS share
B. local server
C. non-linux server
D. remote server
E. bare metal server
  
Answer: AD
 
Explanation
 Cisco DNA Center creates the backup files and posts them to a remote server. Each backup is uniquely stored using the UUID as the directory name.
 To support Assurance data backups, the server must be a Linux-based NFS server that meets the following  requirements:
 Support NFS v4 and NFS v3.
 Cisco DNA Center stores backup copies of Assurance data on an external NFS device and automation data on an external remote sync (rsync) target location.
 The remote share for backing up an Assurance database (NDP) must be an NFS share.

Question 7
A customer wants to provide wireless access to contractors using a guest portal on Cisco ISE. The portal is also used by employees. A solution is implemented, but contractors receive a certificate error when they attempt to access the portal. Employees can access the portal without any errors. Which change must be implemented to allow the contractors and employees to access the portal?
A. Install a trusted third-party certificate on the Cisco ISE.
B. Install an internal CA signed certificate on the Cisco ISE.
C. Install a trusted third-party certificate on the contractor devices.
D. Install an internal CA signed certificate on the contractor devices.
  
Answer: A
 
Explanation
 It is recommended to use the Company Internal CA for Admin and EAP certificates, and a publicly-signed certificate for Guest/Sponsor/Hotspot/etc portals. The reason is that if a user or guest comes onto the network and ISE portal uses a privately-signed certificate for the Guest Portal, they get certificate errors or potentially have their browser block them from the portal page. To avoid all that, use a publicly-signed certificate for Portal use to ensure better user experience.
 Additionally, Each deployment node(s)’s IP address should be added to the SAN field to avoid a certificate warning when the server is accessed via the IP address.

Which IP address becomes the active next hop for 192.168.102.0/24 when 192.168.101.2 fails?
A. 192.168.101.10
B. 192.168.101.14
C. 192.168.101.6
D. 192.168.101.18
  
Answer: D
 
Explanation
 Path Selection Attributes: (highest) Weight > (highest) Local Preference > Originate > (shortest) AS Path > Origin
 > (lowest) MED > External > IGP Cost > eBGP Peering > (lowest) Router ID
 Besides 192.168.101.2, other next hops have the same weight attribute of 0 so we have to consider Local preference.
 There are two next hops with LocPrf of 100 which are 192.168.101.18 and 192.168.101.10 (The field of LocPrf is empty means the default Local Preference of 100). Next we compare their AS Path. The next hop 192.168.101.18 has shorter AS Path so it will be the active next hop when the current one fails.
 
Question 9
What is the API keys option for REST API authentication?
A. a predetermined string that is passed from client to server
B. a one-time encrypted token
C. a username that is stored in the local router database
D. a credential that is transmitted unencrypted

Answer: A
 
Explanation
 In REST API Security – API keys are widely used in the industry and became some sort of standard, however, this method should not be considered a good security measure.
 API Keys were created as somewhat of a fix to the early authentication issues of HTTP Basic Authentication and other such systems. In this method, a unique generated value is assigned to each first time user, signifying that the user is known. When the user attempts to re-enter the system, their unique key (sometimes generated from their hardware combination and IP data, and other times randomly generated by the server which knows them) is used to prove that they’re the same user as before.

Which Python code snippet must be added to the script to save the returned configuration as a JSON-formatted file?

Import json
Import requests

Creds = {"user", "fjaskljfsks"}
Headers = {"Content-Type": "yang+json",
              "Accept": "yang+json"}
BaseURL = https://fjdsklfjsldjsd
URL = BaseURL + "fjsdklsfjdlsfj"
Response = requests.get(URL, auth = Cress, headers = Headers, verify = False)

A. with open(“ifaces.json”, “w”) as OutFile:
 OutFile.write(Response.text)
B. with open(“ifaces.json”, “w”) as OutFile:
 OutFile.write(Response.json())
C. with open(“ifaces.json”, “w”) as OutFile:
 JSONResponse = json.loads(Response.text)
 OutFile.write(JSONResponse)
D. with open(“ifaces.json”, “w”) as OutFile:
 OutFile.write(Response)
  
Answer: A
 
Explanation
 The json() method of the Response interface takes a Response stream and reads it to completion. It returns a promise which resolves with the result of parsing the body text as JSON.
 Response.text returns the content of the response (string), in unicode so we can write it to a file.
 Note: response.json() returns a JSON object of the result so it cannot be written to a file directly.

Answer: A
 
Explanation
 For the source session, we have to configure:
 + Unique session ID.
 + List of source interfaces or source VLANs that you want to monitor. Not all platforms support every possible source.
 + What traffic we want to capture: tx, rx or both.
 + Destination IP address for the GRE tunnel.
  + Origin IP address which is used as the source for the GRE tunnel.
 + Unique ERSPAN flow ID.
 + Optional: you can specify attributes like the ToS (Type of Service), TTL, etc.
 Reference: https://networklessons.com/cisco/ccie-routing-switching-written/erspan
  The configuration in the exhibit is missing destination IP address for the GRE tunnel so we have to add it with the “ip address 10.10.0.1”.

Show ether summary
Group Port-channel Protocol Ports
1     Po1(SD)      -         G1/0/2(D) G1/0/3(D)

The administrator troubleshoots an Etherchannel that keeps moving to err-disabled. Which two actions must be taken to resolve the issue? (Choose two)
A. Reload the switch to force EtherChannel renegotiation
B. Ensure that interfaces Gi1/0/2 and Gi1/0/3 connect to the same neighboring switch
C. Ensure that the neighbor interfaces of Gi1/0/2 and Gi1/0/3 are configured as members of the same EtherChannel
D. Ensure that the corresponding port channel interface on the neighbor switch is named Port-channel1
E. Ensure that the switchport parameters of Port-channel 1 match the parameters of the port channel on the neighbor switch
  
Answer: CE

Explanation
 The errdisable status indicates that the port was automatically disabled by the switch operating system software because of an error condition encountered on the port.
 Check the EtherChannel configuration on both switches. If one side is configured for EtherChannel in the On mode, the peer ports must also be in On mode or they will go to errdisable.

What happens when a FlexConnect AP changes to standalone mode?
A. All controller dependent activities stops working except DFS
B. Only clients on central switching WLANs stay connected
C. All clients roaming continues to work
D. All clients on all WLANs are disconnected
  
Answer: A
 
Explanation
 When a FlexConnect access point enters standalone mode, it disassociates all clients that are on centrally switched WLANs. Controller-dependent activities, such as network access control (NAC) and web authentication (guest access), are disabled.
 However, a FlexConnect access point supports dynamic frequency selection (DFS) in standalone mode.

Question 28
What is a TLOC in a Cisco SD-WAN deployment?
A. value that identifies a specific tunnel within the Cisco SD-WAN overlay
B. identifier that represents a specific service offered by nodes within the Cisco SD-WAN overlay
C. attribute that acts as a next hop for network prefixes
D. component set by the administrator to differentiate similar nodes that offer a common service
  
Answer: C
 
Explanation
 TLOCs serve another important function besides data plane connectivity. In OMP terms (the routing protocol used over the SD-WAN Fabric), the TLOC serves as a next-hop for route advertisements. OMP is very similar to BGP in many ways, and just as the next-hop must be resolvable for BGP to install a route, the same is true of OMP.

Question 29
Which Cisco FlexConnect state allows wireless users that are connected to the network to continue working after the connection to the WLC has been lost?
A. Authentication Down/Switching Down
B. Authentication-Central/Switch-Local
C. Authentication-Down/Switch-Local
D. Authentication-Central/Switch-Central
  
Answer: C
 
Explanation
 A FlexConnect WLAN, depending on its configuration and network connectivity, is classified as being in one of the following defined states.
 + Authentication-Central/Switch-Central: This state represents a WLAN that uses a centralized authentication method such as 802.1X, VPN, or web. User traffic is sent to the WLC via CAPWAP (Central switching). This state is supported only when FlexConnect is in connected mode.
 + Authentication Down/Switching Down: Central switched WLANs no longer beacon or respond to probe requests when the FlexConnect AP is in standalone mode. Existing clients are disassociated.
 + Authentication-Central/Switch-Local: This state represents a WLAN that uses centralized authentication, but user traffic is switched locally. This state is supported only when the FlexConnect AP is in connected mode.
 + Authentication-Down/Switch-Local: A WLAN that requires central authentication rejects new users. Existing authenticated users continue to be switched locally until session time-out if configured. The WLAN continues to beacon  and respond to probes until there are no more existing users associated to the WLAN. This state occurs as a result of the AP going into standalone mode.
 + Authentication-local/switch-local: This state represents a WLAN that uses open, static WEP, shared, or WPA2 PSK security methods. User traffic is switched locally. These are the only security methods supported locally if a FlexConnect goes into standalone mode. The WLAN continues to beacon and respond to probes. Existing users remain connected and new user associations are accepted. If the AP is in connected mode, authentication information for these security types is forwarded to the WLC.

Router(config-pmap-c)#police 100000 conform- action transmit
     
A. Option A
B. Option B
C. Option C
D. Option D
  
Answer: D
 
Explanation
The correct statement should end with “… any any eq 22” as we need the destination port of 22 for SSH, not the source port -> Only Option B and Option D are correct.

But Option B is not correct as the policy map does not define a class-map to match. -> Only Option D is correct.

Note: We don’t need the ACL 100 here as the class-map did not use it.

Which two features does the Cisco SD-Access architecture add to a traditional campus network? (Choose two)
A. private VLANs
B. software-defined segmentation
C. SD-WAN
D. identity services
E. modular QoS
  
Answer: BD
 
Explanation

Question 35
Which feature is used to propagate ARP broadcast, and link-local frames across a Cisco SD-Access fabric to address connectivity needs for silent hosts that require reception of traffic to start communicating?
A. Native Fabric Multicast
B. Layer 2 Flooding
C. SOA Transit
D. Multisite Fabric
  
Answer: B
 
Explanation
 Cisco SD-Access fabric provides many optimizations to improve unicast traffic flow, and to reduce the unnecessary flooding of data such as broadcasts. But, for some traffic and applications, it may be desirable to enable broadcast forwarding within the fabric.
 By default, this is disabled in the Cisco SD-Access architecture. If broadcast, Link local multicast and Arp flooding is required, it must be specifically enabled on a per-subnet basis using Layer 2 flooding feature.
 Layer 2 flooding can be used to forward broadcasts for certain traffic and application types which may require leveraging of Layer 2 connectivity, such as silent hosts, card readers, door locks, etc.

Question 36
An engineer must configure a new loopback interface on a router and advertise the interface as a /24 in OSPF. Which command set accomplishes this task?
A. R2(config)#interface Loopback0
 R2(config-if)#ip address 172.22.2.1 255.255.255.0
 R2(config-if)#ip ospf 100 area 0

B. R2(config)#interface Loopback0
 R2(config-if)#ip address 172.22.2.1 255.255.255.0
 R2(config-if)#ip ospf network broadcast
 R2(config-if)#ip ospf 100 area 0
  
C. R2(config)#interface Loopback0
 R2(config-if)#ip address 172.22.2.1 255.255.255.0
 R2(config-if)#ip ospf network point-to-multipoint
 R2(config-if)#router ospf 100
 R2(config-router)#network 172.22.2.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
 
D. R2(config)#interface Loopback0
 R2(config-if)#ip address 172.22.2.1 255.255.255.0
 R2(config-if)#ip ospf network point-to-point
 R2(config-if)#ip ospf 100 area 0
  
Answer: D
 
Explanation
 Although the configured loopback address is 172.22.2.1/24 but by default OSPF will advertise this route to loopback0 as 172.22.2.1/32 (most specific route to that loopback). In order to override this, we have to change the network type to point-to-point. After this OSPF will advertise the address to loopback as 172.22.2.0/24.
 
Question 37
What is one characteristic of the Cisco SD-Access control plane?
A. It stores remote routes in a centralized database server
B. Each router processes every possible destination and route

Question 46
How do stratum levels relate to the distance from a time source?
A. Stratum 1 devices are connected directly to an authoritative time source
B. Stratum 15 devices are an authoritative time source
C. Stratum 0 devices are connected directly to an authoritative time source
D. Stratum 15 devices are connected directly to an authoritative time source
  
Answer: A
 
Explanation
 NTP uses the concept of a stratum to describe how many hops (routers) away a machine is from an authoritative time source, usually a reference clock. A reference clock is a stratum 0 device that is assumed to be accurate and has little or no delay associated with it. Stratum 0 servers cannot be used on the network but they are directly connected to computers which then operate as stratum-1 servers. A stratum 1 time server acts as a primary network time standard.

 The function of the LISP Map Resolver (MR) is to accept encapsulated Map-Request messages from ingress tunnel routers (ITRs), decapsulate those messages, and then forward the messages to the MS responsible for the egress  tunnel routers (ETRs) that are authoritative for the requested EIDs.
  Reference: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/iproute_lisp/configuration/15-mt/irl-15-mt-book/irl-
  overview.pdf
  In the example below, R3 works as a Map-resolver (MR) to receive and process the EID-to-RLOC mapping lookup queries and provides the mappings to requester.

   MS & MR functions are often included in a single device, which is referred to as an MR/MS device. If MS and MR are two separate devices, MR is responsible to forward the Map-Request messages to the correct MS.

Question 63
Which action occurs during a Layer 3 roam?
A. Client receives a new ip address after getting authenticated
B. The client is marked as “Foreign” on the original controller
C. Client database entry is moved from the old controller to the new controller
D. Client traffic is tunneled back to the original controller after a Layer 3 roam occurs
  
Answer: D
 
Explanation
In instances where the client roams between APs that are connected to different WLCs and the WLC WLAN is connected to a different subnet, a Layer 3 roam is performed, and there is an update between the new WLC (foreign WLC) and the old WLC (anchor WLC) mobility databases.
 If this is the case, return traffic to the client still goes through its originating anchor WLC. The anchor WLC uses Ethernet over IP (EoIP) to forward the client traffic to the foreign WLC, to where the client has roamed. Traffic from the  roaming client is forwarded out the foreign WLC interface on which it resides; it is not tunneled back. (-> Answer D is not correct). But this is contradict to what is said in the Official Cert Guide book:
 “A Layer 3 intercontroller roam consists of an extra tunnel that is built between the client’s original controller and the controller it has roamed to. The tunnel carries data to and from the client as if it is still associated with the original controller and IP subnet.”

 The client begins with a connection to AP B on WLC 1. This creates an ANCHOR entry in the WLC client database. As the client moves away from AP B and makes an association with AP C, WLC 2 sends a mobility announcement to peers in the mobility group looking for the WLC with the client MAC address. WLC 1 responds to the announcement, handshakes, and ACKs. Next the client database entry for the roaming client is copied to WLC 2, and marked as FOREIGN. Included PMK data (master key data from the RADIUS server) is also copied to WLC 2. This provides fast roam times for WPA2/802.11i clients because there is no need to re-authenticate to the RADIUS server.
 After a simple key exchange between the client and AP, the client is added to the WLC 2 database and is similar, except that it is marked as FOREIGN.
 Reference: https://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/solutions/Enterprise/Mobility/emob30dg/TechArch.html
  In Layer 3 roaming, no IP address refresh needed (although client must be re-authenticated and new security session
 established) -> Answer A is not correct.
 In summary, the “Mobility State” of a client is described below:
 + Before roaming: Mobility State = Local
 + After roaming: Mobility State on Old Database = Anchor; Mobility State on New Database = Foreign
 Therefore the client entry on the original controller is not passed to the database totally. The client entry is still on the
 old controller but it is marked “Anchor” (not “Foreign”) -> Answer B is not correct.
 Answer C is not correct as the “Client database entry is not moved, but copied to the new controller.
 -> Therefore the best choice should be answerD.

Question 67
A system must validate access rights to all its resources and must not rely on a cached permission matrix. If the access level to a given resource is revoked but is not reflected in the permission matrix, the security is violated. Which term refers to this REST security design principle?
A. least common mechanism
B. separation of privilege
C. Economy mechanism
D. Complete mediation
  
Answer: D
 
Explanation
 The principle of complete mediation requires that all accesses to objects be checked to ensure that they are allowed. Whenever a subject attempts to read an object, the operating system should mediate the action. First, it determines if the subject is allowed to read the object. If so, it provides the resources for the read to occur. If the subject tries to read the object again, the system should check that the subject is still allowed to read the object. Most systems would not make the second check. They would cache the results of the first check and base the second access on the cached results.

Question 69
Which configuration enables a Cisco router to send information to a TACACS+ server for individual EXEC commands associated with privilege level 15?
A. Router(config)# aaa accounting exec default start-stop group tacacs+
B. Router(config)# aaa authorization exec default group tacacs+
C. Router(config)# aaa accounting commands 15 default start-stop group tacacs+
D. Router(config)# aaa authorization commands 15 default group tacacs+
  
Answer: C
 
Explanation
 Authorization–Provides fine-grained control over user capabilities for the duration of the user’s session, including but not limited to setting autocommands, access control, session duration, or protocol support. You can also enforce restrictions on what commands a user may execute with the TACACS+ authorization feature.
 Accounting–Collects and sends information used for billing, auditing, and reporting to the TACACS+ daemon. Network managers can use the accounting facility to track user activity for a security audit or to provide information for user billing. Accounting records include user identities, start and stop times, executed commands (such as PPP), number of packets, and number of bytes.

Question 70 
An engineer must configure the wireless endpoints to authenticate using Active Directory credentials in an encrypted tunnel in addition to using a hashed password. Which action is required?
A. Configure PEAP with GTC
B. Configure EAP-TLS with MSCHAP v2
C. Configure PEAP with MSCHAP v2
D. Configure EAP-TLS with GTC
  
Answer: C
 
Explanation
 EAP-Transport Layer Security (EAP-TLS) requires an exchange of proof of identities through public key cryptography (such as digital certificates). EAP-TLS secures this exchange with an encrypted TLS tunnel, which helps to resist  dictionary or other attacks.
 EAP-PEAP is a protocol that creates an encrypted (and more secure) channel before the password-based authentication occurs. The PEAP authentication creates an encrypted SSL/TLS tunnel between client and authentication server.
  -> Therefore both PEAP and EAP-TLS can be used to create an encrypted tunnel so both of them are correct.
 Generic Token Card (GTC) enables the exchange of clear-text authentication credentials across the network ->
 Answers with “GTC” are not correct.
 Reference: https://www.arubanetworks.com/techdocs/ClearPass/6.9/PolicyManager/Content/CPPM_UserGuide/Auth/Au
  thMethod_eap-gtc.htm
  If you use EAP-MSCHAPv2, it means that your clients doesn’t need to have a certificate, but your authentication server (NPS) has a certificate. Passwords from the clients are send using hashes to the authentication server.
  You can use PEAP-EAP-MSCHAPv2 which use a certificate on the authentication server (NPS) and a  password for clients. (-> Therefore answer C is correct). You can use PEAP-EAP-TLS which use a certificate on the
  authentication server and a certificate on the client.

Question 78
An engineer must design a wireless network to primarily support 5-GHz clients. The clients do not support the UNII-2c portion of the 5-GHz band. Due to application bandwidth requirements, the engineer uses 40-MHz channels. Which design consideration must be made in this scenario?
A. There are 12 overlapping channels available.
B. There are four non overlapping channel available.
C. There are 25 overlapping channels available.
D. There are six non-overlapping channels available.
  
Answer: B
 
Explanation
 5 Ghz offers significantly more bandwidth than 2.4 GHz. All of the 5 GHz channels offered support at least 20MHz channel width without overlap.
 When using 5 GHz, it is recommended to use at least 40 MHz channel width, as some client devices may not prefer 5 GHz unless it offers a greater channel width than 2.4 GHz.
 If using 40 MHz channel width, the bandwidth of the following channel is used:
 36 – 40
 44 – 48
 149 – 153
 157 – 161
 Note: There are 6 non-overlapping channels but 2 channels are reserved for DFS.
 “However, due to the coexistence of both radar and Wi-Fi networks in the same area of spectrum, the Wi-Fi standard (IEEE 802.11) was designed to incorporate a spectrum sharing mechanism on 5GHz to ensure that Wi-Fi networks do not operate on frequencies (hence causing interference) that are used by nearby radar stations. This mechanism is
 known as Dynamic Frequency Selection (DFS) and is designed to mitigate interference to 5GHz radar by WLANs.”

After configuring the BGP network, an engineer verifies that the path between Server1 and Server2 is functional. Why did RouterSF choose the route from RouterDAL instead of the route from RouterCHI?
A. The Router-ID for Router DAL is lower than the Router-ID for RouterCHI.
B. The route from RouterDAL has a lower MED.
C. BGP is not running on RouterCHI.
D. There is a static route in RouterSF for 10.0.0.0/24.
  
Answer: A
 
Explanation
 From the output of “show bgp 10.0.0.0” command, we see that two paths have the same localpref 100, same AS path length, same Origin IGP. We don’t have information about the Weight so we can guess the Router ID is used to choose the BGP best path.

Question 80
What is a characteristic of a Type 1 hypervisor?
A. It is installed on an operating system and supports other operating systems above it.
B. It is completely independent of the operating system.
C. Problems in the base operating system can affect the entire system.
D. It is referred to as a hosted hypervisor.
  
Answer: B
 
Explanation
 There are two types of hypervisors: type 1 and type 2 hypervisor.
 In type 1 hypervisor (or native hypervisor), the hypervisor is installed directly on the physical server. Then instances of an operating system (OS) are installed on the hypervisor. Type 1 hypervisor has direct access to the hardware resources. Therefore they are more efficient than hosted architectures. Some examples of type 1 hypervisor are VMware vSphere/ESXi, Oracle VM Server, KVM and Microsoft Hyper-V.
 In contrast to type 1 hypervisor, a type 2 hypervisor (or hosted hypervisor) runs on top of an operating system and not the physical hardware directly. A big advantage of Type 2 hypervisors is that management console software is not required. Examples of type 2 hypervisor are VMware Workstation (which can run on Windows, Mac and Linux) or
 Microsoft Virtual PC (only runs on Windows).

Refer to the exhibit.

Import json
from requests import get

Creds = {"user", "fjaskljfsks"}

Headers = {"Content-Type": "yang+json",
              "Accept": "yang+json"}
Devices = open("devices.txt", "r")
for Device in Devices.readlines():
	Hostname, IP , Login, Pass = Device.strip().split(",")
	URL = f"https://sfjklafsjklasfjklfasjlfjldsk"
	Creds = (Login, Pass)
	Response = requests.get(URL, auth = Creds, headers = Headers, verify = False)
 
How should the script be completed so that each device configuration is saved into a JSON-formatted file under the device name?
A. Append to the body of the for loop:
 with open(f”{Hostname}.json”, “w”) as OutFile:
 OutFile.write(Response.text)
B. Insert after the for loop:
 with open(f”{Hostname}.json”, “w”) as OutFile:
 OutFile.write(json.dumps(Response.text))
C. Insert after the for loop:
 with open(f”{Hostname}.json”, “w”) as OutFile:
 OutFile.write(Response)
D. Insert immediately before the for loop:
 with open(f”{Hostname}.json”, “w”) as OutFile:
 OutFile.write(json.load(Devices))
  
Answer: A
 
Explanation
 We need to write the Response in the for loop because the Response would change for every element of the loop.
 “Insert after the for loop” in Python means the for loop ends before our code is executed.
 
Question 84
Which EEM script generates a critical-level syslog message and saves a copy of the running configuration to the bootflash when an administrator saves the running configuration to the startup configuration?
A. action 1.0 cli command “enable”
 action 2.0 cli command “configure terminal”
 action 3.0 cli command “file prompt quiet”
 action 4.0 cli command “end”
 action 5.0 cli command copy running-config bootflash:/current_config.txt
 action 6.0 cli command “configure terminal”
 action 7.0 cli command “no file prompt quiet”
 action 8.0 syslog priority critical msg “Configuration saved and copied to bootflash”

B. action 1.0 cli command copy running-config bootflash:/current_config.txt
 action 2.0 syslog msg “Configuration saved and copied to bootflash”

C. action 1.0 cli command copy running-config bootflash:/current_config.txt
 action 2.0 syslog priority critical msg “Configuration saved and copied to bootflash”

D. action 1.0 cli command “enable”
 action 2.0 cli command “file prompt quiet”
 action 3.0 cli command copy running-config bootflash:/current_config.txt
 action 4.0 cli command “no file prompt quiet”
 action 5.0 syslog priority critical msg “Configuration saved and copied to bootflash”
  
Answer: A
 
Explanation
 When we use the “copy” command , the device asks many parameters although we provided it in the command. For example:
     Router#copy system:running-config tftp://10.0.0.2/fw-test Source filename [running-config]?
Address or name of remote host [10.0.0.2]?
Destination filename [fw-test]?
!!
2009 bytes copied in 0.604 secs (3326 bytes/sec)
   Therefore we can disable the annoying questions with the file prompt quiet configuration command. This command is under global configuration mode:
  Therefore we must enter the “configure terminal” command first.

Question 87
What is a characteristics of a vSwitch?
A. enables VMs to communicate with each other within a virtualized server
B. supports advanced Layer 3 routing protocols that are not offered by a hardware switch
C. has higher performance than a hardware switch
D. operates as a hub and broadcasts the traffic toward all the vPorts

Answer: A
 
Explanation
 Hypervisors provide virtual switch (vSwitch) that Virtual Machines (VMs) use to communicate with other VMs on the same host. The vSwitch may also be connected to the host’s physical NIC to allow VMs to get layer 2 access to the outside world.
 Each VM is provided with a virtual NIC (vNIC) that is connected to the virtual switch. Multiple vNICs can connect to a single vSwitch, allowing VMs on a physical host to communicate with one another at layer 2 without having to go out to
 a physical switch.
    Although vSwitch does not run Spanning-tree protocol but vSwitch implements other loop prevention mechanisms. For example, a frame that enters from one VMNIC is not going to go out of the physical host from a different VMNIC card.

Question 90
Which option works with a DHCP server to return at least one WLAN management interface IP address during the discovery phase and is dependent upon the VCI of the AP?
A. Option 43
B. Option 42
C. Option 125
D. Option 15

Answer: A
 
Explanation
 The DHCP client sends option code 60 in a DHCPREQUEST to the DHCP server. When the server receives option 60, it sees the VCI, finds the matching VCI in its own table, and then it returns option 43 with the value (that corresponds to the VCI), thereby relaying vendor-specific information to the correct client. Both the client and server have knowledge of the VCI.
 Reference: https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/9-0/pan-os-admin/networking/dhcp/dhcp-options/dhcp-options-
  43-55-and-60-and-other-customized-options
  The AP boots up, performs POST, and then sends a DHCP request. The switch should send out a DHCP offer, an IP address to use, a default gateway to use, and also the option 43 TLV . The TLV should contain the IP address of the WLC, with which the AP needs to be associated.

Question 97
What is a characteristics of traffic policing?
A. lacks support for marking or remarking
B. can be applied in both traffic directions
C. must be applied only to outgoing traffic
D. queues out-of-profile packets until the buffer is full
  
Answer: B
 
Explanation
 Policing: is used to control the rate of traffic flowing across an interface. During a bandwidth exceed (crossed the maximum configured rate), the excess traffic is generally dropped or remarked. The result of traffic policing is an output rate that appears as a saw-tooth with crests and troughs. Traffic policing can be applied to inbound and outbound interfaces. Unlike traffic shaping, QoS policing avoids delays due to queuing. Policing is configured in bytes.

E. ip nat pool ftp-pool 10.10.110.2 10.10.110.9 netmask 255.255.255.0
 access-list 23 permit 10.10.110.10
 ip nat inside destination-list 23 pool ftp-pool

Answer: AC
 
Explanation
 The purpose of this question is when someone tries to access the IP 10.10.110.10, the IP addresses from 10.0.0.2 to 10.0.0.9 will be handed out in a rotary fashion. This performs a basic form of load balancing. In order to do this, we need “type rotary” in the “ip nat pool ...” statement -> Answer C is correct.
 Also Gi0/0 interface must be the NAT inside interface -> Answer A is correct.
 
Question 103
A large campus network has deployed two wireless LAN controllers to manage the wireless network. WLC1 and WLC2 have been configured as mobility peers. A client device roams from AP1 on WLC1 to AP2 on WLC2, but the controller’s client interfaces are on different VLANs. How do the wireless LAN controllers handle the inter-subnet roaming?
A. WLC2 marks the client with a foreign entry in its own database. The database entry is copied to the new controller and marked with an anchor entry on WLC1
B. WLC2 marks the client with an anchor entry in its own database. The database entry is copied to the new controller and marked with a foreign entry on WLC1
C. WLC1 marks the client with a foreign entry in its own database. The database entry is copied to the new controller and marked with an anchor entry on WLC2
D. WLC1 marks the client with an anchor entry in its own database. The database entry is copied to the new controller and marked with a foreign entry on WLC2
  
Answer: D

Explanation
 In instances where the client roams between APs that are connected to different WLCs and the WLC WLAN is connected to a different subnet, a Layer 3 roam is performed, and there is an update between the new WLC (foreign WLC) and the old WLC (anchor WLC) mobility databases.
 If this is the case, return traffic to the client still goes through its originating anchor WLC. The anchor WLC uses Ethernet over IP (EoIP) to forward the client traffic to the foreign WLC, to where the client has roamed. Traffic from the roaming client is forwarded out the foreign WLC interface on which it resides; it is not tunneled back.

 The client begins with a connection to AP B on WLC 1. This creates an ANCHOR entry in the WLC client database. As the client moves away from AP B and makes an association with AP C, WLC 2 sends a mobility announcement to peers in the mobility group looking for the WLC with the client MAC address. WLC 1 responds to the announcement, handshakes, and ACKs. Next the client database entry for the roaming client is copied to WLC 2, and marked as FOREIGN. Included PMK data (master key data from the RADIUS server) is also copied to WLC 2. This provides fast roam times for WPA2/802.11i clients because there is no need to re-authenticate to the RADIUS server.
 After a simple key exchange between the client and AP, the client is added to the WLC 2 database and is similar, except that it is marked as FOREIGN.

An administrator troubleshoots intermittent connectivity from internal hosts to an external public server. Some internal hosts can connect to the server while others receive an ICMP Host Unreachable message and these hosts change over time. What is the cause of this issue?
A. The translator does not use address overloading
B. The NAT pool netmask is excessively wide
C. The NAT ACL and NAT pool share the same name
D. The NAT ACL does not match all internal hosts
  
Answer: A
 
Explanation
 As we can see there is the line “type generic, total addresses 2, allocated 2(100%), missed 7”. This means all the IP addresses for NAT have been allocated and 7 requests were missed. It means this is NAT 1:1, not PAT so answer A is correct.
 Answer D is not correct as the NAT ACL covers internal hosts 10.0.3.1 but it still failed to allocated address so we cannot say it does not match all internal hosts.

Answer: C
 
Explanation
 A strange thing here is we have to “deny” source 10.0.0.5 in the ACL so that it is excluded from “policy-map CoPP”. It will be matched by the “class-default” which is implemented implicitly at the end of the policy-map. This default class will match all the traffic and allows them by default.

Switch 2
interface Gig0/0
switchport trunk encap dot1q
switchport mode trunk
channel-group 1 mode active

interface Gig0/1
switchport trunk encap dot1q
switchport mode trunk
channel-group 1 mode passive

The port channel between the switches does not work as expected. Which action resolves the issue?
A. Interface Gi0/0 on Switch2 must be configured as passive.
B. Interface Gi0/1 on Switch1 must be configured as desirable.
C. Interface Gi0/1 on Switch2 must be configured as active.
D. Trunking must be enabled on both interfaces on Switch2.
  
Answer: C
 
Explanation
 With above configuration, the Port-channel 1 of Switch1 is in trunking mode “on”:
   We try changing the Etherchannel mode of Gi0/1 on Switch2 to “active” and it worked.
  This is because one side is mode “On” while the other side is mode “active”.

Question 4
Refer to the exhibit.
     
Device#configure terminal Device(config)#netconf ssh acl 1 
Device(config)#netconf lock-time 100 
Device(config)#netconf max-sessions 1 
Device(config)#netconf max-message 10
   
A network engineer must configure NETCONF. After creating the configuration, the engineer gets output from the command show line, but not from show running-config. Which command completes the configuration?
A. Device(config)# no netconf ssh acl 1
B. Device(config)# netconf max-sessions 100
C. Device(config)# netconf lock-time 500
D. Device(config)# netconf max-message 1000
  
Answer: D
 
Explanation
 If we use the “no netconf ssh acl 1” then the whole NETCONF function will be disabled so the best answer should be “netconf max-message 1000” as it will increase the maximum size of messages received in a NETCONF session to 1000KB (~1MB).

 Note:
 + The valid range for the netconf lock-time seconds is 1 to 300 so 500 is not a valid value.
 + The valid range for the netconf max-sessions number is 4 to 16 so 100 is not a valid value.

Question 7
An engineer must create an EEM script to enable OSPF debugging in the event the OSPF neighborship goes down. Which script must the engineer apply?

     Option A
event manager applet ENABLE_OSPF_DEBUG 
event syslog pattern “%OSPF-5-ADJCHG: Process 6, Nbr 1.1.1.1 on Serial0/0 from FULL to DOWN” action 1.0 cli command “enable”
action 2.0 cli command “debug ip ospf event” 
action 3.0 cli command “debug ip ospf adj”
action 4.0 syslog priority informational msg “ENABLE_OSPF_DEBUG”

       Option B
event manager applet ENABLE OSPF_DEBUG 
event syslog pattern “%OSPF-5-ADJCHG: Process 5, Nbr 1.1.1.1 on Serial0/0 from LOADING to FULL” action 1.0 cli command “debug ip ospf event”
action 2.0 cli command “debug ip ospf adj”
action 3.0 syslog priority informational msg “ENABLE_OSPF_DEBUG”

      Option C

action 4.0 syslog priority informational msg “ENABLE_OSPF_DEBUG”
     
A. Option A
B. Option B
C. Option C
D. Option D
  
Answer: A
 
Explanation
 This EEM script is only used when OSPF neighborship goes down so the OSPF must be “from FULL to DOWN”, not “from LOADING to FULL” so Option B and Option D are not correct. Also the SEVERITY level of Syslog message of this event is 5 (notification) so it must be “%OSPF-5-ADJCHG”, not “%OSPF-1-ADJCHG” -> Only Option A is correct.
 
Question 8A
A network engineer is adding an additional 10Gbps link to an exiting 2x10Gbps LACP-based LAG to augment its capacity. Network standards require a bundle interface to be taken out of service if one of its member links goes down, and the new link must be added with minimal impact to the production network. Which does the engineer do first?
A. Execute the channel-group number mode active command to add the 10Gbps link to the existing bundle
B. Validate the network layer of the 10Gbps link
C. Validate the physical and data link layers of the 10Gbps link
D. Execute the lacp min-bundle 3 command to set the minimum of ports threshold

Answer: C

Explanation
 “Network standards require a bundle interface to be taken out of service if one of its member links goes down” -> Use the lacp min-bundle command to configure the minimum number of active links allowed in an LACP bundle. When the number of active links falls below this minimum threshold, the port channel shuts down.
 LACP is used so we must configure the new port with “channel-group number mode active” command before setting the limitation of 3 ports or the Etherchannel link would go down.

A. 192.168.1.1
B. 192.168.1.2
C. 65000
D. 65001

Answer: DACB
 
Explanation
 1. 65001
 2. 192.168.1.1
 3. 65000
 4. 192.168.1.1

  This question did not tell us which router we are configuring so we suppose we are configuring Client router (which is more reasonable). Therefore in the first box we have to enter the BGP AS number (same as “router bgp {as-number}” command).
 In the second and third box we have to configure BGP neighbor information (same as “neighbor {neighbor-IP-address}
 remote-as {remote-as}” command).
 In the last box we have to configure under “address-family ipv4” mode so we need to type the neighbor IP address once more.
 Note: The first box is the BGP id, which means the BGP AS Number, not the router-id so we have to use 65001, not 192.168.1.2. You can see the difference in the figure below:

Question 11
Refer to the exhibit.

AP(config)# aaa group server radius rad_auth
AP(config-sg-radius)# server 10.0.0.3 auth-port 1645 acct-port 1646
AP(config)# aaa new-model

AP(config-if-ssid)# encryption mode wep mandatory
   
A company requires that all wireless users authenticate using dynamic key generation. Which configuration must be applied?
A. AP(config-if-ssid)# authentication open wep wep_methods
B. AP(config-if-ssid)# authentication dynamic wep wep_methods
C. AP(config-if-ssid)# authentication dynamic open wep_dynamic
D. AP(config-if-ssid)# authentication open eap eap_methods
  
Answer: D
 
Explanation
 When your SSID authentication mechanism uses Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) with 802.1x  authentication (and without WPA v1 or WPA v2 support), dynamic WEP keys can be generated for each wireless user.
  Dynamic WEP keys are more secure than static, or unchanging, WEP keys. If an intruder passively receives enough packets encrypted by the same WEP key, the intruder can perform a calculation to learn the key and use it to join your network. Because they change frequently, dynamic WEP keys prevent intruders from performing the calculation and learning the key.

Question 12
Which threat defense mechanism, when deployed at the network perimeter, protects against zero-day attacks?
A. intrusion prevention
B. stateful inspection
C. sandbox
D. SSL decryption
  
Answer: A
 
Explanation
 A zero-day (or 0-day) vulnerability is a software vulnerability that is discovered by attackers before the vendor has become aware of it. By definition, no patch exists for zero-day vulnerabilities and user systems have no defenses in place, making attacks highly likely to succeed. The name “zero-day” is designed to imply how long since the
 vulnerability was discovered. The term also indicates that system developers have had zero days to fix it.
 Intrusion Protection
 While the precise methods of a zero-day exploit can’t be known in advance, a network intrusion protection system (NIPS) can monitor the firms’ network for unusual activity.
 The advantage of NIPS over a traditional antivirus only system is it does not rely on checking software against a known database of threats. This means it does not need updates or patches to learn about the latest attacks. NIPS works by monitoring the day-to-day patterns of network activity across the network.
 When traffic or events far out of the ordinary are detected action can be taken to alert system administrators and lock down the firewall. Devices such as USB drives and mobile devices can all introduce threats to the network. They can often make it past the firewall because they are physically introduced to the system.
 NIPS protects against threats introduced to the network from both external and internal sources.

Question 14
Which two items are found in YANG data models? (Choose two)
A. HTTP return codes
B. rpc statements
C. JSON schema
D. container statements
E. XML schema
  
Answer: BD
 
Explanation
 The following YANG example uses a container statement to define a timeout mechanism for a request to a server. The timeout has two components: access-timeout, which represents the maximum time without server response, and retries, which represents the number of request attempts before giving up.
      container timeout {
   leaf access-timeout {
   type uint32;
   }
   leaf retries {
   }
type uint8;
      }
    Reference: https://www.tail-f.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Tail-f-Instant-YANG.pdf
  IOS XR actions are RPC statements that trigger an operation or execute a command on the router. Theses actions are defined as YANG models using RPC statements. An action is executed when the router receives the corresponding NETCONF RPC request. Once the router executes an action, it replies with a NETCONF RPC response.

  data-models-config-guide-ncs5000_chapter_010.html
  Note: A data model is simply a well understood and agreed upon method to describe “something”. As an example, consider this simple “data model” for a person.
 Person
 •Gender-male, female, other
 •Height-Feet/Inches or Meters
 •Weight-Pounds or Kilos
 •Hair Color-Brown, Blond, Black, Red, other
 •Eye Color-Brown, Blue, Green, Hazel, other

Question 15
What is a characteristic of Cisco DNA Northbound APIs?
A. They utilize RESTCONF
B. They enable automation of network infrastructure based on intent
C. They simplify the management of network infrastructure devices
D. They utilize multivendor support APIs
  
Answer: B
 
Explanation
 Software-Defined Access (SDA) uses the software-defined architectural model, with a controller and various APIs. At the center sits the Digital Network Architecture (DNA) Center controller. DNA Center is the controller for SDA networks.

Question 16
What is required for intercontroller Layer 3 roaming?
A. Mobility groups are established between wireless controllers.
B. WLCs have the same IP addresses configured on their interfaces.
C. WLCs use separate DHCP servers.
D. The management VLAN is present as a dynamic VLAN on the second WLC.
  
Answer: A
 
Explanation
 If the management VLAN of one controller is present as a dynamic VLAN on another controller, the mobility feature is not supported -> Answer D is not correct.
 Cisco Wireless Controllers (that are mobility peers) must use the same DHCP server to have an updated client mobility move count on intra-VLAN -> Answer C is not correct.
 The figure below shows intercontroller Layer 3 roaming, which occurs when the wireless LAN interfaces of the controllers are on different IP subnets... -> Answer B is not correct.

 Reference: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/wireless/controller/8-5/config-guide/b_cg85/overview.html
  Therefore answer A is the only answer left.
 
Question 17
What is required for a virtual machine to run?
A. a hypervisor and physical server hardware
B. a Type 1 hypervisor and a host operating system
C. only a Type 1 hypervisor
D. only a Type 2 hypervisor
  
Answer: A
 
Explanation
 In order to run VM, we need a Physical Server and a hypervisor.

Question 18
Which technology uses network traffic telemetry, contextual information, and file reputation to provide insight into cyber threats?
A. threat defense
B. security services
C. security intelligence
D. segmentation
  
Answer: A
 
Explanation
 According to the CCNP and CCIE Enterprise Core ENCOR 350-401 Official Cert Guide Book in Chapter 25: Secure Network Access Control:
 Threat defense: It is important to have visibility into the most dangerous cyber threats. Threat defense provides this visibility through network traffic telemetry, file reputation, and contextual information (such as device types, locations, users, identities, roles, privileges levels, login status, posture status, and so on). It enables assessment of the nature and the potential risk of suspicious activity so that the correct next steps for cyber threats can be taken.
 Note:
 Security intelligence: Security intelligence provides detection of emerging malware and cyber threats. It enables an infrastructure to enforce policy dynamically, as reputations are augmented by the context of new threats. This enables accurate and timely security protection.
 
Question 19
An engineer must configure AAA on a Cisco 9800 WLC for central web authentication. Which two commands are needed to accomplish this task? (Choose two)
A. (Cisco Controller)> config radius acct add 10.10.10.12 1812 SECRET
B. (Cisco Controller)> config wlan aaa-override enable <wlan-id>
C. (Cisco Controller)> config wlan aaa-override disable <wlan-id>
D. Device(config-locsvr-da-radius)#client 10.10.10.12 server-key 0 SECRET
E. Device(config)# aaa server radius dynamic-author
  
Answer: DE
 
Explanation
 Answer B and answer C are used to enable/disable AAA Override option but it is just optional so they are not the correct answers. AAA Override enables you to apply VLAN tagging, Quality of Service, and Access Control Lists to individual clients based on the returned RADIUS attributes from the AAA server.
 According to this Cisco link (under AAA Configuration on 9800 WLCs) section, we need the following commands:
      # aaa new-model
# radius server <radius-server-name>
# address ipv4 <radius-server-ip> auth-port 1812 acct-port 1813 # timeout 300
# retransmit 3
# key <shared-key>
# exit
# aaa group server radius <radius-grp-name> # server name <radius-server-name>
# exit
# aaa server radius dynamic-author
# client <radius-server-ip> server-key <shared-key>
# aaa authentication dot1x <dot1x-list-name> group <radius-grp-name>
   Therefore answer D and answer E are correct.
 
Question 20
Refer to the exhibit.

QOS - Silver (BE)
App Visibility - Off
AVC Profile - none
Netflow Monitor - none
Fastlane - Disable
WMM Policy - Allowed
  
An engineer is troubleshooting an application running on Apple phones. The application is receiving incorrect QoS markings. The systems administrator confirmed that all configuration profiles are correct on the Apple devices. Which change on the WLC optimizes QoS for these devices?
A. Enable Fastlane
B. Set WMM to required
C. Change the QoS level to Platinum
D. Configure AVC Profiles
  
Answer: A

Explanation
 Apple iOS device mark QoS as per IETF recommendations. With WLC running AireOS8.3, you can enable the Fastlane feature, which enables several beneficial functions:
 – Your WLC QoS configuration is optimized globally to better support real-time applications
  – iOS 10 devices can send upstream voice traffic without the requirement to perform WMM TSPEC/TCLAS negotiation. The infrastructure will honor the voice marking for these devices.
  – You can apply a QoS profile to your iOS 10 devices, and decide which applications should receive QoS marking upstream, and which applications should be sent as best effort or background.

Question 23
What are two benefits of implementing a Cisco SD-WAN architecture? (Choose two)
A. It provides resilient and effective traffic flow using MPLS
B. It improves endpoint protection by integrating embedded and cloud security features
C. It allows configuration of application-aware policies with real time enforcement
D. It simplifies endpoint provisioning through standalone router management
E. It enforces a single, scalable, hub-and-spoke topology
  
Answer: BC
 
Explanation
 The top SD-WAN benefits are:
 + Increased bandwidth at a lower cost
 + Centralized management across branch networks
  + Full visibility into the network
 + Providing organizations with more connection type options and vendor selection when building a network.
 Reference: https://www.sdxcentral.com/networking/sd-wan/definitions/sd-wan-technology/
  -> We can provision endpoints (vEdges) through a centralized router vManage -> Answer D is correct.
 Answer A is not correct as we can use different kind of connections on SD-WAN: MPLS, LTE, 4G, xDSL, Internet connections...
 Application-Aware Routing policy is configured in vManage as a centralized data policy that maps the service-side application(s) to specific SLA requirements. The centralized policies provisioned in vSmart controller is pushed to relevant WAN Edge devices for enforcement. The defined policy consists of match-action pairs, where the match statement defines the application-list or the type of traffic to match, and the action statement defines the SLA action the WAN Edge devices must enforce for the specified traffic.
 Reference: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/solutions/CVD/SDWAN/cisco-sdwan-application-aware-routing-
  deploy-guide.html
  -> Therefore answer C is correct.
 Answer E is not correct as it is not a benefit of SD-WAN.
 Answer B is not wrong but it is not the best choice so we don’t choose it.

return answer

main()

A. The answer is 25
B. The answer is 70
C. The answer is 5
D. The answer is 100
  
Answer: A
 
Explanation
 The “magic” function receives a number, which is 5 from main() in this question. This function returns a result of 5 + 2*10 = 25 and the str() function converts it into a string (“25”) before printing to the terminal.

Question 28
A script contains the statement “while loop != 999:”. Which value terminates the loop?
A. A value less then or equal to 999
B. A value greater then or equal to 999
C. A value not equal to 999
D. A value equal to 999
  
Answer: D
 
Explanation
 The “while {expression}” loop exits when the expression is false. Therefore only the expression “999 != 999” is false so this is the correct answer.
 Note: “!=” means “is not equal to”.

Question 32A
Which of the following are related to OSPF? (Choose two)
A. The path metric is simple and based on interface cost
B. The path metrics are complex
C. The summary can be interface based
D. The route summary is not interface based

Answer: AD

Explanation
 OSPF offers two methods of route summarization:
 1) Summarization of internal routes performed on the ABRs
 2) Summarization of external routes performed on the ASBRs
 Unlike OSPF where we can summarize only on ABR or ASBR, in EIGRP we can summarize anywhere. Manual summarization can be applied anywhere in EIGRP domain, on every router, on every interface via the ip summary-address eigrp as-number address mask [administrative-distance ] command (for example: ip summary-address eigrp 1 192.168.16.0 255.255.248.0).

Question 38
How can an engineer prevent basic replay attacks from people who try to brute force a system via REST API?
A. Use HTTPS
B. Use a password hash
C. Add OAuth to the request in the API header
D. Add a timestamp to the request in the API header
  
Answer: D
 
Explanation
 Consider Adding Timestamp in Request
 Along with other request parameters, you may add a request timestamp as an HTTP custom header in API requests.
 The server will compare the current timestamp to the request timestamp and only accepts the request if it is after a reasonable timeframe (30 seconds, perhaps).
 This will prevent very basic replay attacks from people who are trying to brute force your system without changing this timestamp.

Question 39
A network monitoring system uses SNMP polling to record the statistics of router interfaces. The SNMP queries work as expected until an engineer installs a new interface and reloads the router. After this action, all SNMP queries for the router fail. What is the cause of this issue?
A. The SNMP community is configured incorrectly
B. The SNMP interface index changed after reboot
C. The SNMP server traps are disabled for the interface index
D. The SNMP server traps are disabled for the link state
  
Answer: B
 
Explanation
 In order to tell IOS to keep ifindex value unchanged even after reboot, use the “snmp-server ifindex persist” command.
 
Question 40
If a client’s radio device receives a signal strength of -67 dBm and the noise floor is -85 dBm, what is the SNR value?
A. 15 dB
B. 16 dB
C. 18 dB
D. 20 dB
  
Answer: C
 
Explanation
 If your SNR measurements are already in decibel form, then you can subtract the noise quantity from the desired signal: SNR = S – N. This is because when you subtract logarithms, it is the equivalent of dividing normal numbers.
 Also, the difference in the numbers equals the SNR. In this question, SNR = -67 – (-85) = 18.

Question 42
 An engineer must create a new SSID on a Cisco 9800 wireless LAN controller. The client has asked to use a pre-shared key for authentication. Which profile must the engineer edit to achieve this requirement?
A. RF
B. Policy
C. WLAN
D. Flex
  
Answer: C
 
Explanation
 If you are familiar with AireOS, you are used to configure all characteristics for an SSID under WLAN configuration. On 9800 WLCs, these settings are split between WLAN Profile and Policy Profile. Also, some of the configuration seen under the Global AP Configuration Page on AireOS GUI has been moved to the AP Join Profile. Here you can find the list of all the settings that you can configure under each profile.

D. R1(config)#interface loopback0
 R1(config-if)#ip ospf network non-broadcast
  
Answer: A
 
Explanation
 Setting OSPF to point-to-point mode results in advertised routes containing the actual subnet mask instead of the default behavior of advertising /32 for a loopback interface.
 
Question 44
A customer requests a design that includes GLBP as the FHRP. The network architect discovers that the members of the GLBP group have different throughput capabilities. Which GLBP load balancing method supports this environment?
A. host dependent
B. weighted
C. round robin
D. least connection

Answer: B
 
Explanation
 Host Dependent is required when an application requires traffic flows to be tracked (for example when using NAT).
 Round Robin is recommended as the default, it is suitable for all other requirements. Weighted can be used if there are  disparities in the capabilities of gateways in the GLBP group.

Question 45
What is one primary REST security design principle?
A. password hash
B. fail-safe defaults
C. adding a timestamp in requests
D. OAuth
  
Answer: B
 
Explanation
 The paper “The Protection of Information in Computer Systems” by Jerome Saltzer and Michael Schroeder, put forth eight design principles for securing information in computer systems, as described in the following sections:
 + Least Privilege: An entity should only have the required set of permissions to perform the actions for which they are authorized, and no more. Permissions can be added as needed and should be revoked when no longer in use.
 + Fail-Safe Defaults: A user’s default access level to any resource in the system should be “denied” unless they’ve been granted a “permit” explicitly.
 + The economy of Mechanism: The design should be as simple as possible. All the component interfaces and the interactions between them should be simple enough to understand.
 + Complete Mediation: A system should validate access rights to all its resources to ensure that they’re allowed and should not rely on the cached permission matrix. If the access level to a given resource is being revoked, but that isn’t reflected in the permission matrix, it would violate the security.
 + Open Design: This principle highlights the importance of building a system in an open manner—with no secret, confidential algorithms.
 + Separation of Privilege: Granting permissions to an entity should not be purely based on a single condition, a combination of conditions based on the type of resource is a better idea.
 + Least Common Mechanism: It concerns the risk of sharing state among different components. If one can corrupt the shared state, it can then corrupt all the other components that depend on it.
 + Psychological Acceptability: It states that security mechanisms should not make the resource more difficult to access than if the security mechanisms were not present. In short, security should not make worse the user experience.

Question 48
A network engineer configures a WLAN controller with increased security for web access. There is IP connectivity with the WLAN controller, but the engineer cannot start a management session from a web browser. Which action resolves the issue?
A. Use a private or incognito session.
B. Disable Adobe Flash Player
C. Disable JavaScript on the web browser
D. Use a browser that supports 128-bit or larger ciphers.
  
Answer: D
 
Explanation
 Enable or disable secure web mode with increased security by entering this command:
 config network secureweb cipher-option high {enable | disable}
 This command allows users to access the controller GUI using “https://ip-address” but only from browsers that support 128-bit (or larger) ciphers. With Release 8.10, this command is, by default, in enabled state.
  When high ciphers is enabled, SHA1, SHA256, SHA384 keys continue to be listed and TLSv1.0 is disabled. This is applicable to webauth and webadmin but not for NMSP.

How does the router handle traffic after the CoPP policy is configured on the router?
A. Traffic coming to R1 that does not match access list SNMP is dropped.
B. Traffic generated by R1 that matches access list SNMP is policed.
C. Traffic passing through R1 that matches access list SNMP is policed.
D. Traffic coming to R1 that matches access list SNMP is policed.
  
Answer: B
 
Explanation
From the line “Service-policy output: CoPP”, we learned that this is the “output” service-policy, not input. Therefore this policy is only applied to traffic DESTINED TO or GENERATED from control plane of the local device.

B. Configure no shutdown on interface Gi0/0
C. Enable fast LACP PDUs on interface Gi0/0
D. Configure channel-group 1 mode active on interface Gi0/0
  
Answer: A
 
Explanation
 Interface Gi0/0 is in hot standby state. Therefore, the LACP parameters have been met and the max bundle links has been reached. Therefore we have to increase the max bundle links to 2.
 
Question 54
A network engineer is enabling HTTPS access to the core switch, which requires a certificate to be installed on the switch signed by the corporate certificate authority. Which configuration commands are required to issue a certificate
 signing request from the core switch?

A. Core-Switch(config)#crypto pki trustpoint Core-Switch
 Core-Switch(ca-trustpoint)#enrollment terminal
 Core-Switch(config)#crypto pki enroll Core-Switch

B. Core-Switch(config)#crypto pki enroll Core-Switch
 Core-Switch(config)#ip http secure-trustpoint Core-Switch

C. Core-Switch(config)#ip http secure-trustpoint Core-Switch
 Core-Switch(config)#crypto pki enroll Core-Switch

D. Core-Switch(config)#crypto pki trustpoint Core-Switch
 Core-Switch(ca-trustpoint)#enrollment terminal
 Core-Switch(config)#ip http secure-trustpoint Core-Switch
  
Answer: A
 
Explanation
 Certificate authorities (CAs) are responsible for managing certificate requests and issuing certificates to participating IPSec network devices. These services provide centralized security key and certificate management for the participating devices. Specific CA servers are referred to as “trustpoints.”
 The command “crypto pki trustpoint name” declares the trustpoint and a given name and enters ca-trustpoint configuration mode.
 The command “enrollment terminal” specifies manual cut-and-paste certificate enrollment method. The certificate request will be displayed on the console terminal so that you may manually copied (or cut).

 The command “crypto pki enroll name” generates certificate request and displays the request for copying and pasting into the certificate server.
 The full configuration is shown in the reference below.

Area 0
	R3 and R7
Area 1
	R1 and R6
Area 2
	R9
Area 3
	R2

An engineer must prevent the R6 loopback from getting into Area 2 and Area 3 from Area 0. Which action must the engineer take?
A. Apply a fitter list inbound on R2 and R9
B. Apply a filter list outbound on R3 and R7
C. Apply a filter list outbound on R7 only
D. Apply a filter list inbound on R3 and R7
  
Answer: D
 
Explanation
 In this topology, R3 and R7 are in fact the ABRs. If we apply an area filtering inbound direction (with the “area area-number filter-list prefix ... in” commands) on R3 and R7 then the ABRs will filter prefixes that enter this area. For example, on R7 we use the command “area 2 filter-list prefix Deny_Lo_R6 in” command then the Lo interface of R6 will not be advertised into area 2.
 Note: The “area area-number filter-list prefix ... out” (out direction) will prevent prefixes from advertising outside of this area although the ABR still learns about these prefixes.
 In particular, the following commands will prevent R6 loopback from getting into Area 3 on R3 (of course we have to configure the same thing on R7):
   R3(config)#ip prefix-list PREVENT_R1_LO deny 1.1.1.1/32 R3(config)#ip prefix-list PREVENT_R1_LO permit 0.0.0.0/0 le 32
  
   R3(config)#router ospf 1
R3(config-router)#area 3 filter-list prefix PREVENT_R1_LO in
   Notice that we applied the filter-list for area 3, not area 0.
 Just for your information, if we want to use an outbound filter-list to prevent R6 loopback from getting into Area 2 & 3,
 we can do it on R3 & R7 for area 1 with the following commands:
     R7(config)#ip prefix-list PREVENT_R6_LO deny 1.1.1.1/32 R7(config)#ip prefix-list PREVENT_R6_LO permit 0.0.0.0/0 le 32 R7(config)#router ospf 1
R7(config-router)#area 1 filter-list prefix PREVENT_R6_LO out
   But with these commands, R6 loopback is also not advertised into area 0, which is not satisfied the requirement
 “prevent the R6 loopback from getting into Area 2 and Area 3 from Area 0“.
  We found a good tutorial with same topology and requirement at https://ccieblog.co.uk/ospf/ospf-filter-lists

A. ip nat inside source static tcp 10.1.1.100 80 209.165.200.225 80 extendable
 ip nat inside source static tcp 10.1.1.100 80 209.165.201.1 80 extendable
B. ip nat inside source static tcp 10.1.1.100 80 209.165.200.225 80
 ip nat inside source static tcp 10.1.1.100 80 209.165.201.1 80
C. ip nat inside source static tcp 10.1.1.100 80 209.165.200.225 80
 ip nat inside source static tcp 10.1.1.100 8080 209.165.201.1 8080
D. ip nat inside source static tcp 10.1.1.100 80 209.165.200.225 80 no-alias
 ip nat inside source static tcp 10.1.1.100 80 209.165.201.1 80 no-alias
  
Answer: A
 
Explanation
 First let’s check the command “ip nat inside source static tcp 10.1.1.100 80 209.165.200.225 80 extendable”.
 First we will not mention about the effect of the “extendable” keyword. So the purpose of the command “ip nat inside source static tcp 10.1.1.100 80 209.165.200.225 80” is to translate packets on the inside interface (Gi0/1 interface in this case) with a source IP address of 10.1.1.100 and port 80 to the IP address 209.165.200.225 with port 80. This also implies that any packet received on the outside interface with a destination address of 209.165.200.225:80 has the destination translated to 10.1.1.100:80.
 Now we will talk about the keyword “extendable”.
 Usually, the “extendable” keyword should be added if the same Inside Local is mapped to different Inside Global Addresses (the IP address of an inside host as it appears to the outside network). An example of this case is when you have two connections to the Internet on two ISPs for redundancy. So you will need to map two Inside Global IP
 addresses into one inside local IP address. For example:
       NAT router:
ip nat inside source static 192.168.1.1 200.1.1.1 extendable
ip nat inside source static 192.168.1.1 200.2.2.2 extendable //Inside Local: 192.168.1.1 ; Inside Global: 200.1.1.1 & 200.2.2.2
   
Question 58
Based on the router’s API output in JSON format below, which Python code will display the value of the “hostname” key?

{
	"response": [{
		"family": "Switches",
		"macAddress": "jfskdljdfkl",
		"hostname": "sfjlksdjfl"
	}]
}

A. json_data = json.loads(response.text)
 print(json_data[‘response’][‘family’][‘hostname’])
B. json_data = response.json()
 print(json_data[‘response’][0][‘hostname’])
C. json_data = response.json()
 print(json_data[‘response’][family][hostname’])
D. json_data = json.loads(response.text)
 print(json_data[response][0][hostname])
  
Answer: B
 
Explanation
 Note: The json() method of the Response interface takes a Response stream and reads it to completion. It returns a promise which resolves with the result of parsing the body text as JSON.
 In the Python code below, we had to use json.loads() method instead ofresponse.json() to demonstrate because we cannot reproduce the result without a REST API call.
  In practical, we have to call the API like this:
 response = requests.get(“http://{URL_to_get_API}”)
 json_data = response.json()

logging buffered discriminator Disc1 
logging monitor discriminator Disc1
logging host 10.1.55.237 discriminator Disc1
   
A network engineer is enabling logging to a local buffer, to the terminal and to a syslog server for all debugging level logs filtered by facility code 7. Which command is needed to complete this configuration snippet?
A. logging buffered debugging
B. logging discriminator Disc1 severity includes 7
C. logging buffered discriminator Disc1 debugging
D. logging discriminator Disc1 severity includes 7 facility includes fac7
  
Answer: D
 
Explanation
 If your routers/switches send useless but high-level messages to your syslog server, you can use a logging discriminator to eliminate some unwanted log messages.
 The “logging discriminator Disc1 severity includes 7 facility includes fac7” command enables the logging discriminator named Disc1 to filter messages with a severity level of 7 (debugging level) and facility code 7.

A. Option A
B. Option B
C. Option C
D. Option D
  
Answer: D
 
Explanation
 There is a typo in the exhibit: R4 should be connected to subnet 172.16.1.0/24 at the right side, not 172.16.10.0/24. Also the same lab can be found at https://community.cisco.com/t5/networking-documents/understanding-bgp-best-
  path-selection-manipulation/ta-p/3150576
  According to this lab, options A B and C are correct. Option B is correct too if we have the command “clear ip bgp 13.13.13.3 soft in”. Therefore it is difficult to say which question should be chosen. But we chose the local preference answer as it is the second significant attribute of BGP.
 
Question 63
In a Cisco SD-Access solution, which protocol is used by an extended node to connect to a single edge node?
A. IS-IS
B. 802.1Q
C. VXLAN
D. CTS
  
Answer: B
 
Explanation
 Extended Node
 SD-Access Extended Nodes provide the ability to extend the enterprise network by providing connectivity to non-carpeted spaces of an enterprise – commonly called the Extended Enterprise. This allows network connectivity and management of IoT devices and the deployment of traditional enterprise end devices in outdoor and non-carpeted
 environments such as distribution centers, warehouses, or Campus parking lots.
 This feature extends consistent, policy-based automation to Cisco Industrial Ethernet, Catalyst 3560-CX Compact, and Digital Building Series switches and enables segmentation for user endpoints and IoT devices connected to these nodes. Using Cisco DNA Center automation, switches in the extended node role are onboarded to their connected edge node using an 802.1Q trunk over an EtherChannel with one or multiple physical link members. Extended nodes are discovered using zero-touch Plug-and-Play.

Question 64
What is a characteristic of Cisco StackWise technology?
A. It uses proprietary cabling
B. It supports devices that are geographically separated
C. It combines exactly two devices
D. It is supported on the Cisco 4500 series.
  
Answer: A
 
Explanation

Question 65
 In a Cisco SD-WAN solution, which two functions are performed by OMP? (Choose two)
A. advertisement of network prefixes and their attributes
B. segmentation and differentiation of traffic
C. gathering of underlay infrastructure data
D. delivery of crypto keys
E. configuration of control and data policies
  
Answer: AD
 
Explanation
 OMP is the control protocol that is used to exchange routing, policy, and management information between Cisco vSmart Controllers and Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN devices in the overlay network. These devices automatically initiate OMP peering sessions between themselves, and the two IP end points of the OMP session are the system IP addresses of the two devices.
 The OMP protocol is responsible for:
 – Distribution of Transport Locators (TLOCs) among network sites in the sd-wan domain.
 – Distribution of service-side reachability information.
 – Distribution of service-chaining information.
 – Distribution of data plane security parameters, VPN labels, and crypto keys.
  – Distribution of data and application-aware routing (AAR) policies. (Answer E is not correct as OMP is only distribute,
 not configure data policies)

 ip prefix-list INTO-AREA1 seq 10 permit 0.0.0.0/0 le 32
 router ospf 200
 area 1 filter-list prefix INTO-AREA1 out
  
Answer: C
 
Explanation
 Route filtering in OSPF works differently than EIGRP/RIP, etc. The distribute-list and prefix-list in OSPF do not filter
 LSAs that are sent and received between routers.
 ABR can filter LSA type 3. To filter LSA type 3 in OSPF, use the area filter-list command in ABR. By using inbound
 filtering into an area, it does not matter from which area the prefix came, everything that goes into area 1 will hit the
 prefix-list and will be filtered.

Question 68
By default, which virtual MAC address does HSRP group 16 use?
A. c0:41:43:64:13:10
B. 00:00:0c:07:ac:10
C. 05:00:0c:07:ac:16
D. 00:05:5c:07:0c:16
  
Answer: B
 
Explanation
 HSRP version 1 uses the MAC address range 0000.0C07.ACxx while HSRP version 2 uses the MAC address range
 0000.0C9F.F0xx.
 The last two-digit hex value in the MAC address presents the HSRP group number. In this case 16 in decimal is 10 in hexadecimal. -> Answer B is correct.

A. egress tunnel routers to map resolvers to determine the appropriate egress tunnel router
B. ingress tunnel routers to map servers to determine the appropriate egress tunnel router
C. egress tunnel routers to map servers to determine the appropriate egress tunnel router
D. ingress tunnel routers to map resolvers to determine the appropriate egress tunnel router
  
Answer: C
 
Explanation
 During operation, an Egress Tunnel Router (ETR) sends periodic Map-Register messages to all its configured map servers.
 
Question 70
Which method is used by an AP to join HA controllers and is configured in NVRAM?
A. Primary/Secondary/Tertiary/Backup
B. DNS
C. IP Helper Addresses
D. stored WLC information
  
Answer: D

Explanation
 To discover a WLC, an AP sends a unicast CAPWAP Discovery Request to a controller’s IP address or a broadcast to the local subnet. If the controller exists and is working, it returns a CAPWAP Discovery Response to the AP. The exact sequence of discovery steps used in Controller Software Release 7.0 is as follows:
 Step 1. Broadcast on the local subnet—The AP will broadcast a CAPWAP
 Discovery Request on its local wired subnet. Any WLCs that also exist on the subnet will answer with a CAPWAP Discovery Response.
 Step 2. Use locally stored WLCs – An AP can be “primed” with up to three controllers – a primary, a secondary, and a tertiary. These are stored in nonvolatile memory so that the AP can remember them after a reboot or power failure.

		}
	}),
	verify = False)

print("Response Code: " + str(response.status_code))
   
After the code is run on a Cisco IOS-XE router, the response code is 204. What is the result of the script?
A. The configuration fails because another interface is already configured with IP address 10.10.10.1/24.
B. The configuration fails because interface GigabitEthernet2 is missing on the target device.
C. The configuration is successfully sent to the device in cleartext.
D. Interface GigabitEthernet2 is configured with IP address 10.10.10.1/24
  
Answer: D
 
Explanation
 The 204 status code means that the request was received and understood, but that there is no need to send any data back. The server has fulfilled the request but does not need to return an entity-body, and might want to return updated meta information.
 Note: HTTP status code of 2xx means “Success”, which indicates that the client’s request was accepted successfully.

Question 77
An administrator must enable Telnet access to Router X using the router username and password database for authentication. Which configuration should be applied?
A. RouterX(config)#aaa new-model
 RouterX(config)#aaa authentication login auth-list local
B. RouterX(config)#line vty 0 4
 RouterX(config-line)#login
 RouterX(config-line#end
C. RouterX(config)#line aux 0
 RouterX(config-line)#password cisco
 RouterX(config-line#login
D. RouterX(config)#line vty 0 4
 RouterX(config-line)#login local
 RouterX(config-line#end

Answer: D
 
Explanation
 “login” command uses only a password while the “login local” command requires the configuration of a username as well as a password.
 Login local, means that authentication uses locally configured credentials using the
 “username {username} ... password ... “command in global configuration mode.
 -> We configure “login local” to enable Telnet access using username and password in the local database.

 network 172.24.206.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
  
Answer: D
 
Explanation
 By using the correct and exact network and subnet masks, CR1 will not turn on OSPF on new interfaces and it cannot exchange OSPF with other network devices by other interfaces than Gi0/0 & Gi0/1.
 In this question we should understand that these commands make sure CR1 cannot form OSPF neighbor relationship with other routers directly (on a new interface). If it is connected through a switch then surely it can form OSPF neighbor relationship. For example if we add a new router to SW3 in the 10.165.231.0/24 subnet then surely it will create OSPF neighbor relationshipo with CR1.
 Answer “router ospf 1
 network 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255 area 0
 passive-interface GigabitEthernet0/2′′
 is not correct because if CR1 has a new interface then OSPF will also be turned on that interface.
 Answer “interface Gi0/2
 ip ospf 1 area 0

 !
 router ospf 1
 passive-interface GigabitEthernet0/2′′
 is not correct as OSPF is not run on Gi0/1 and CR1 and CR3 cannot exchange OSPF information.
 
Question 81 
In which two ways does TCAM differ from CAM? (Choose two)
A. CAM is used to make Layer 2 forwarding decisions, and TCAM is used for Layer 3 address lookups.
B. The MAC address table is contained in TCAM, and ACL and QoS information is stored in CAM.
C. CAM is used for software switching mechanisms, and TCAM is used for hardware switching mechanisms.
D. CAM is used by routers for IP address lookups, and TCAM is used to make Layer 2 forwarding decisions.
E. The MAC address table is contained in CAM, and ACL and QoS information is stored in TCAM.
  
Answer: AE
 
Explanation
 When using Ternary Content Addressable Memory (TCAM) inside routers it’s used for faster address lookup that enables fast routing.
 In switches Content Addressable Memory (CAM) is used for building and lookup of mac address table that enables L2 forwarding decisions.

An engineer attempts to establish BGP peering between router CORP and two ISP routers. What is the root cause for the failure between CORP and ISP#2?
A. Router ISP#2 is configured to use SHA-1 authentication.
B. Router CORP is configured with an extended access control list.
C. There is a password mismatch between router CORP and router ISP#2.
D. MD5 authorization is configured incorrectly on router ISP#2.
  
Answer: C
 
Explanation
No MD5 digest means a password is not set or a password mismatch between the two endpoints.

Question 85B
Which of the following are Agentless?
A. Puppet
B. Ansible
C. SaltStack

Answer: B

Explanation

Question 1
An engineer must export the contents of the devices object in JSON format. Which statement must be use?

import json
from json import dumps, loads

Devices=[{
"name": "distsw",
...
"pass": "sfdjklsjdflksfjklfjsd"
}]

A. json.print(Devices)
B. json.loads(Devices)
C. json.dumps(Devices)
D. json.repr(Devices)
  
Answer: C
 
Explanation
 json.loads() takes in a string and returns a json object while json.dumps() takes in a json object and returns a string. In this question, “Devices” is a ‘list’, not a string so we have to “dumps” it first to convert it into a string before printing it out.
  Try printing with “loads”:
  Note: JSON does not have attributes “print” or “repr” so we cannot use them.

Question 3
Refer to the exhibit.

debug ip icmp
ping 10.1.3.2 size 1500 df-bit
Packet sent with the DF bit set
MMMMM
0 percent success

An engineer troubleshoots connectivity issues with an application. Testing is performed from the server gateway, and traffic with the DF bit set is dropped along the path after increasing packet size. Removing the DF bit setting at the gateway prevents the packets from being dropped. What is the cause of this issue?
A. PMTUD does not work due to ICMP Packet Too Big messages being dropped by an ACL
B. The remote router drops the traffic due to high CPU load
C. The server should not set the DF bit in any type of traffic that is sent toward the network
D. There is a CoPP policy in place protecting the WAN router CPU from this type of traffic
  
Answer: C
 
Explanation
 If the DF bit is set, routers cannot fragment packets. The ping result of “MMMMM” means “Maximum transmission unit (MTU) problem. Could not fragment.” -> In this case, packet needs to be fragmented but we disabled fragmentation via DF bit.

Which configuration change will force BR2 to reach 209.165.201.0/27 via BR1?
A. Set the origin to igp on BR2 toward PE2 inbound
B. Set the local preference to 150 on PE1 toward BR1 outbound
C. Set the weight attribute to 65,535 on BR1 toward PE1
D. Set the MED to 1 on PE2 toward BR2 outbound
  
Answer: D
 
Explanation
 We cannot set the local preference on PE1 because local preference is only sent to iBGP neighbors so this attribute cannot reach BR1 -> Answer B is not correct.
 Weight attribute is only used locally in a router (not be exchanged between BGP neighbors) so we cannot affect BR2 from BR1 with this attribute -> Answer C is not correct.
 We cannot affect BR2 routing decision by modifying BGP advertisements from BR2 toward PE2 (inbound) -> A is not correct. Also if network 209.165.201.0/27 is advertised with “network” statement in BGP, BR2 will match it with origin “IGP”. Please check the example in the link below.
 By default, the MED attribute is set to 0 so by increasing the MED on PE2 toward BR2, BR2 would think the metric of its direct link to PE2 is higher than the path advertised by BR1 -> BR2 would use BR1 to reach 209.165.201.0/27.

An engineer configures VRRP and issues the show commands to verify operation. What does the engineer confirm about VRRP group 1 from the output?
A. There is no route to 10.10.1.1/32 in R2’s routing table
B. If R1 reboots, R2 becomes the master virtual router until R2 reboots
C. Communication between VRRP members is encrypted using MD5
D. R1 is master if 10.10.1.1/32 is in its routing table
  
Answer: D
 
Explanation
 We don’t have any information about the route to 10.10.1.1/32 so we cannot say if answer A is correct or not. Answer B is not correct because if R2 reboots, R2 only becomes the master until R1 is up again (not until R2 reboots) because “preempt” is enabled by default with VRRP. Answer C is not correct because R1 & R2 are authenticating via plain text, not MD5.

 R1 is tracking the route to 10.10.1.1/32, if this route is removed from R1’s routing table, the VRRP priority of R1 would be decreased by 20 (110 – 20 = 90) which is smaller than the priority of R2 -> R2 would take the master role ->
 Answer D is correct.

BR(config)#interface tunnel1 
BR(config-if)#keepalive 5 3

HQ(config)#interface tunnel1 
HQ(config-if)#keepalive 5 3
  
What is the effect of these commands on the BR and HQ tunnel interfaces?
A. The tunnel line protocol goes down when the keepalive counter reaches 6
B. The keepalives are sent every 5 seconds and 3 retries
C. The keepalives are sent every 3 seconds and 5 retries.
D. The tunnel line protocol goes down when the keepalive counter reaches 5
  
Answer: B
 
Explanation
 The syntax of keepalive command is: keepalive {seconds retries} so R1 will send keepalive message every 5 seconds and retry 3 times. If all of the keepalive messages are failed, R1 concludes the tunnel was broken.

Question 11
What is used to perform QoS packet classification?
A. the Options field in the Layer 3 header
B. the Type field in the Layer 2 frame
C. the Flags field in the Layer 3 header
D. the ToS field in the Layer 3 header
  
Answer: D
 
Explanation
 Layer-3 marking is accomplished using the 8-bit Type of Service (ToS) field, part of the IP header. A mark in this field will remain unchanged as it travels from hop-to-hop, unless a Layer-3 device is explicitly configured to overwrite this field. There are two marking methods that use the ToS field:
 + IP Precedence: uses the first three bits of the ToS field.
 + Differentiated Service Code Point (DSCP): uses the first six bits of the ToS field. When using DSCP, the ToS field is often referred to as the Differentiated Services (DS) field.
 
Question 17
An engineer must provide wireless converge in a square office. The engineer has only one AP and believes that it should be placed it in the middle of the room. Which antenna type should the engineer use?
A. directional
B. polarized
C. Yagi
D. omnidirectional
  
Answer: D
 
Explanation
 Types of external antennas:
 + Omnidirectional: Provide 360-degree coverage. Ideal in houses and office areas
 + Directional: Focus the radio signal in a specific direction. Examples are the Yagi and parabolic dish
 + Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) – Uses multiple antennas (up to eight) to increase bandwidth
 An omnidirectional antenna is designed to provide a 360-degree radiation pattern. This type of antenna is used when coverage in all directions from the antenna is required.

40	Desg	FWD	2	128.9	P2p Edge
  
How was spanning-tree configured on this interface?
A. By entering the command spanning-tree portfast trunk in the interface configuration mode.
B. By entering the command spanning-tree portfast in the interface configuration mode
C. By entering the command spanning-tree mst1 vlan 10,20,30,40 in the global configuration mode
D. By entering the command spanning-tree vlan 10,20,30,40 root primary in the interface configuration mode
  
Answer: A
 
Explanation
 As we see in the output, the type of this interface in all VLANs are “Edge” (which automatically transitions the port to the spanning tree forwarding state without passing through the blocking or learning states) so maybe this interface
 was configured with “portfast” command. There are many VLANs on this single interface so we can deduce it is a trunk port. Therefore the best answer here should be the command “spanning-tree portfast trunk” has been entered.
 
Question 25
An engineer is troubleshooting the AP join process using DNS. Which FQDN must be resolvable on the network for the access points to successfully register to the WLC?
A. cisco-capwap-controller.domain.com
B. wlchostname.domain.com
C. ap-manager.domain.com
D. primary-wlc.domain.com
  
Answer: A
 
Explanation
 The lightweight access points support the following controller discovery processes:
 ...
 DNS discovery—The access point can discover controllers through your domain name server (DNS). You must configure your DNS to return controller IP addresses in response to CISCO-CAPWAP-CONTROLLER.localdomain,
 where localdomain is the access point domain name. When an access point receives an IP address and DNS information from a DHCP server, it contacts the DNS to resolve CISCO-CAPWAP-CONTROLLER.localdomain. When the DNS sends a list of controller IP addresses, the access point sends discovery requests to the controllers.

Question 28
Which measurement is used from a post wireless survey to depict the cell edge of the access points?
A. CCI
B. Noise
C. SNR
D. RSSI
  
Answer: D
 
Explanation
 The following are elements that you should consider when performing a post assessment of the environment.
 Analyze and define the cell edge: This requires the use of AirMagnet Survey, although there are simple tools like Omnipeek or Wireshark that can be used to measure wireless traffic as a client roams from one AP to another.
 According to design best practices that revolve around the Cell Edge Design, a wireless handset should roam before the RSSI reaches -67 dBm. You can analyze signal strength and determine the approximate cell edge by measuring the signal strength in a beacon frame as you move from the center of one cell towards the edge of that cell.

Question 29
Refer to the exhibit.

Packet
Src: 192.168.1.1, Dst: 192.168.3.1
TTL: 2
ICMP
Type: 8 (Echo ping request)

Devices between S1 and S2: R1, R2, R3
 
While troubleshooting a routing issue, an engineer issues a ping from S1 to S2. Which two actions from the initial value of the TTL? (Choose two)
A. The packet reaches R3, and the TTL expires
B. R2 replies with a TTL exceeded message
C. R1 replies with a TTL exceeded message
D. The packet reaches R2 and the TTL expires
E. R3 replies with a TTL exceeded message
F. The packet reaches R1 and the TTL expires
  
Answer: BD
 
Explanation
 “Routers decrement the TTL by 1 every time they forward a packet; if a router decrements the TTL to 0, it throws away the packet. This prevents packets from rotating forever.” We want to make it clear that before the router forwards a
 packet, the TTL is still remain the same.
 For example in the topology below, pings to S0/1 and S0/0 of Router 2 have the same TTL.
 If a router finds a TTL value of 1 or 0, it drops the datagram and sends an Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) time-to-live-exceeded message to the sender.
 Reference: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/routers/ir910/software/release/1_1/configuration/guide/ir910scg/s
  wtrbl.pdf
  The picture below shows TTL values for each interface of each router and for HostB. Notice that Host A initializes ICMP
 packet with a TTL of 255: 
  Therefore in this question, if the initial TTL is 2, then R1 receives the packet with TTL of 2, then it decreases the TTL
 before forwarding to R2. R2 receives packet with TTL of 1 then decreases the TTL to 0 so R2 drops the packet ( ->
 Answer D is correct). R2 also replies back to the source with an ICMPv4 Type 11, Code 0 Time Exceeded message ->
 Answer B is correct.
 
Question 30

   20 permit ip 172.16.0.0 0.0.15.255 any
    
Which command set must be added to permit and log all traffic that comes from 172.20.10.1 in interface GigabitEthernet0/1 without impacting the functionality of the access list?
     
Option A
Router(config)#ip access-list extended 100

Router(config-if)#access-group 100 in

Option C
Router(config)#access-list 100 permit ip host 172.20.10.1 any log 
Router(config)#interface GigabitEthernet0/1 
Router(config-if)#access-group 100 in

Option D  
Router(config)#access-list 100 seq 5 permit ip host 172.20.10.1 any log 
Router(config)#interface GigabitEthernet0/1 
Router(config-if)#access-group 100 in

A. Option A
B. Option B
C. Option C
D. Option D
  
Answer: C
 
Explanation
 Option A logs the whole subnet 172.20.10.0/24, not only host 172.20.10.1 so it is not correct.
 Option B does not log traffic coming from 172.20.10.1 so it is not correct.
 We tested option D but the command “access-list 100 seq 5 permit ip host 172.20.10.1 any log” is not accepted as shown below:
  Option C would append the access-list (statement 30 in the above figure) so it is the best answer.
 
Question 31
What is the function of a fabric border node in a Cisco SD-Access environment?
A. To connect the Cisco SD-Access fabric to another fabric or external Layer 3 networks
B. To collect traffic flow information toward external networks
C. To attach and register clients to the fabric
D. To handle an ordered list of IP addresses and locations for endpoints in the fabric.
  
Answer: A
 
Explanation
 There are five basic device roles in the fabric overlay:
 + Control plane node: This node contains the settings, protocols, and mapping tables to provide the endpoint-to- location (EID-to-RLOC) mapping system for the fabric overlay.
 + Fabric border node: This fabric device (for example, core layer device) connects external Layer 3 networks to the
 SDA fabric.
 + Fabric edge node: This fabric device (for example, access or distribution layer device) connects wired endpoints to the SDA fabric.
 + Fabric WLAN controller (WLC): This fabric device connects APs and wireless endpoints to the SDA fabric.
 + Intermediate nodes: These are intermediate routers or extended switches that do not provide any sort of SD-Access fabric role other than underlay services.

Question 33
What is one benefit of implementing a VSS architecture?
A. It provides multiple points of management for redundancy and improved support.
B. It provides a single point of management for improved efficiency
C. It uses GLBP to balance traffic between gateways
D. It uses a single database to manage configuration for multiple switches
  
Answer: B
 
Explanation
 VSS increases operational efficiency by reducing switch management overhead and simplifying the network. It provides a single point of management, IP address, and routing instance.
 VSS can be managed with single management point from which you configure and manage the VSS. Neighbors see the VSS as a single Layer 2 switching or Layer 3 routing node, thus reducing the control protocol traffic. VSS provides a single VLAN gateway IP address, removing the need for the first-hop redundancy protocol (HSRP, VRRP, GLBP).
 Multichannel EtherChannel (MEC) allows you to bundle links to two physical switches in VSS, creating a loop-free redundant topology without the need for STP.

Question 35
An engineer runs the code against an API of Cisco DNA Center, and the platform returns this output.

Response 405

import requests

import urllib3

urllib3.disable_warnings(urllib3.exceptions.insecureRequestWarning)

def main():
	device_uri = "https://192.168.1.1/sdjkfljdlk/auth/token"
	http_result = requests.get(device_uri, auth=("root", "fsdjkslfdjklfds")0
	print(http_result)
	if <wrong>
		print("call failed. review get_token()")
	print(http_result.json()["Token"])

What does the response indicate?
A. The authentication credentials are incorrect
B. The URI string is incorrect
C. The Cisco DNA Center API port is incorrect
D. The HTTP method is incorrect
  
Answer: D
 
Explanation
 From the output, we learn that a “Response [405]” was returned. The 405 Method Not Allowed is an HTTP response status code indicating that the specified request HTTP method was received and recognized by the server, but the server has rejected that particular method for the requested resource. Therefore answer B is not correct.
 From this page (https://developer.cisco.com/docs/dna-center/#!command-runner/endpoints-and-methods-used), we
  may find out where the issue is:
 “The Authentication endpoint used in this guide is /dna/system/api/v1/auth/token, which is valid for version 1.2.6 and above. The HTTP method used for the endpoint is POST and it requires for the user to send its credentials using Basic Authentication.
 Note: For systems with versions below that, the endpoint is /api/system/v1/auth/token”
 Therefore the most suitable reason for this issue is we have to use “POST” instead of “GET” (in requests.get) ->
 Answer D is the best choice.
 
Question 36
What is a consideration when designing a Cisco SD-Access underlay network?
A. End user subnets and endpoints are part of the underlay network
B. The underlay switches provide endpoint physical connectivity for users
C. Static routing is a requirement
D. It must support IPv4 and IPv6 underlay networks

Answer: B
 
Explanation
 In SD-Access, the underlay switches (edge nodes) support the physical connectivity for users and endpoints. However, end-user subnets and endpoints are not part of the underlay network—they are part of the automated overlay network.

GET https://fsjkldjfskl.com/dna/intent/api/v1/network-devices

"response": {
	"errorCode": "Bad request"
	"detail": "s is not a valid UUID of device"

POSTMAN is showing an attempt to retrieve network device information from Cisco DNA Center API. What is the issue?
A. The token has expired
B. The URI string is incorrect
C. Authentication has failed
D. The JSON payload contains the incorrect UUID
  
Answer: B
 
Explanation
 We tested with Postman successfully with URI https://sandboxdnac.cisco.com/dna/intent/api/v1/network-device
 
   But when changing URI to https://sandboxdnac.cisco.com/dna/intent/api/v1/network-devices (appending the last letter “s” in “network-devices”) we could reproduce the error in this question:

  Therefore we can conclude the incorrect URI is the cause of this error.

AttributeError: "module" object has no attribute "manager"
 
A. from ncclient import *
B. import manager
C. from ncclient import
D. import ncclient manager
  
Answer: A
 
Explanation
 Importing a module (“ncclient” in this case) does not automatically import submodules/functions (“manager” in this case) so the above script causes error.
 Answer B is not correct as we cannot directly import “manager” as it is a function in “ncclient”.
 Answer C is not correct as we did not specify anything after keyword “import”.
 Answer D is not correct as it is missing a dot “.” (it should be “import ncclient.manager).
 We tested both answer ‘from ncclient import *’ and answer ‘import ncclient.manager’ in Python and both of them worked well.

Question 50
 Which line must be added in the Python function to return the JSON object {“cat_9k”:”FXS193202SE”)?

import json
def get_data():
test_json = {
	"response": [{
	"managementIP": "10.10.2.253",
	"memorySize": "fsdjklsjfskl",
	"serialNumber": "FXS193202SE",
	"hostname": "cat_9k"
	}]}

A. return (json.dumps({d[‘hostname’]: d[‘serialNumber’] for d in json.loads(test_json)[‘response’]}))
B. return (json.loads({for d in json.dumps(test_json)[‘response’]: d[‘hostname’]: d[‘serialNumber’]}))
C. return (json.loads({d[‘hostname’]: d[‘serialNumber’] for d in json.dumps(test_json)[‘response’]}))
D. return (json.dumps({for d in json.loads(test_json)[‘response’]: d[‘hostname’]: d[‘serialNumber’]}))
  
Answer: A
 
Explanation
 Our first variable test_json is a string which we cannot loop through so we have to convert it into a dictionary type first with json.loads() function -> Therefore we must use “json.loads(test_json)[‘response’]”, not json.dumps(...) in the for loop. Then we can use the for loop to iterate through the dictionary. The script below is an example:
      import json
   json_string = '{"key1": "value1", "key2": "value2"}'
      #Load JSON string to a dictionary
   json_dictionary = json.loads(json_string)
      #Loop through dictionary keys
   for key in json_dictionary:
   print(key, ":", json_dictionary[key])
      OUTPUT:
   key1 : value1
   key2 : value2
   
 -> Only answer A and answer D are correct.
 We also tested both of the answers in Atom, only the first answer is correct:
  The second one returned error:
   
 -> Only answer A is correct.
 Note:
 + json.dumps() function converts a Python object into a json string. For example: json.dumps({‘name’: ‘John’,’age’:
 ’20’})
 + json.loads() method parses a valid JSON string and convert it into a Python Dictionary.
 
Question 51
 Which two operational models enable an AP to scan one or more wireless channels for rouge access points and at the same time provide wireless services to clients? (Choose two)
A. Sniffer
B. Rouge detector
C. Local
D. FlexConnect
E. Monitor
  
Answer: CD
 
Explanation
 An LAP operates in one of six different modes:
 + Local mode (default mode): measures noise floor and interference, and scans for intrusion detection (IDS) events every 180 seconds on unused channels
 + FlexConnect, formerly known as Hybrid Remote Edge AP (H-REAP), mode: allows data traffic to be switched locally and not go back to the controller. The FlexConnect AP can perform standalone client authentication and switch VLAN
 traffic locally even when it’s disconnected to the WLC (Local Switched). FlexConnect AP can also tunnel (via CAPWAP)
 both user wireless data and control traffic to a centralized WLC (Central Switched).
 + Monitor mode: does not handle data traffic between clients and the infrastructure. It acts like a sensor for location-
 based services (LBS), rogue AP detection, and IDS
 + Rogue detector mode: monitor for rogue APs. It does not handle data at all.
 + Sniffer mode: run as a sniffer and captures and forwards all the packets on a particular channel to a remote machine
 where you can use protocol analysis tool (Wireshark, Airopeek, etc) to review the packets and diagnose issues. Strictly used for troubleshooting purposes.
 + Bridge mode: bridge together the WLAN and the wired infrastructure together.
 + Sensor mode: this is a special mode which is not listed in the books but you need to know. In this mode, the device can actually function much like a WLAN client would associating and identifying client connectivity issues within the
 network in real time without requiring an IT or technician to be on site.
 Although Monitor and Rogue detector mode can detect rough APs but they do not handle data so they are not correct.
 Rogue Detection
 A rogue is essentially any device that shares your spectrum, but is not in your control. This includes rogue Access Points, wireless router, rogue clients, and rogue ad-hoc networks. The Cisco UWN uses a number of methods to detect
 Wi-Fi-based rogue devices such as off-channel scanning and dedicated monitor mode capabilities. Cisco Spectrum Expert can also be used to identify rogue devices not based on the 802.11 protocol, such as Bluetooth bridges.
 Off-Channel Scanning
 This operation is performed by Local and Flex-Connect (in connected mode) mode APs and utilizes a time-slicing technique which allows client service and channel scanning with the usage of the same radio.

Question 56A
Which of the following are related to OSPF? (Choose four)
A. supports virtual links
B. can automatically summarize networks at the boundary
C. requires manual configuration of network summarization
D. uses Dijkstra’s Shortest Path First algorithm
E. uses Diffused Update Algorithm
F. uses bandwidth, delay, reliability and load for routing metric
G. uses an election process

Answer: ACDG

Explanation
 Unlike OSPF where we can summarize only on ABR or ASBR, in EIGRP we can summarize anywhere.
 Manual summarization can be applied anywhere in EIGRP domain, on every router, on every interface via the ip summary-address eigrp as-number address mask [administrative-distance ] command (for example: ip summary- address eigrp 1 192.168.16.0 255.255.248.0). Summary route will exist in routing table as long as at least one more specific route will exist. If the last specific route will disappear, summary route also will fade out. The metric used by EIGRP manual summary route is the minimum metric of the specific routes.

Question 65
Rapid PVST+ is enabled on all switches. Which command set must be configured on Switch1 to achieve the following results on port fa0/1?

 + When a device is connected, the port transitions immediately to a forwarding state
 + The interface should not send or receive BPDUs.
 + If a BPDU is received, it continues operating normally.

A.
 Switch1(config)# interface f0/1
 Switch1(config-if)# spanning-tree portfast
 Switch1(config-if)# spanning-tree bpduguard enable

B.
 Switch1(config)# spanning-tree portfast bpduguard default
 Switch1(config)# interface f0/1
 Switch1(config-if)# spanning-tree portfast

C.
 Switch1(config)#interface f0/1
 Switch1(config-if)# spanning-tree portfast

D.
 Switch1(config)#spanning-tree portfast bpdufilter default
 Switch1(config)# interface f0/1
 Switch1(config-if)# spanning-tree portfast
  
Answer: D
 
Explanation
 BPDU Guard feature allows STP to shut an access port in the event of receiving a BPDU and put that port into err- disabled state so it is not the answer we want here.
 BPDUFilter is designed to suppress the sending and receiving of BPDUs on an interface. If a BPDU is received on a Port Fast-enabled interface, the interface loses its Port Fast-operational status, and BPDU filtering is disabled -> BPDUFilter is the answer we want.
 There are two ways to configure BPDU filtering feature, one in global configuration mode and one under a specific interface:
 Configuring BPDU filter globally:
 Switch(config)#spanning-tree portfast bpdufilter default
 Configure BPDU Filter on the interface:
 Switch(config-if)#spanning-tree bpdufilter enable (this overrides the global bpdufilter command above)
 But the effect of these two commands are different and you should remember:
 + When BPDU filtering is enabled globally; and if BPDUs are seen, the port loses its PortFast status, BPDU filtering is disabled, the port returns to normal state
 + When BPDU filtering is enabled on a specific port, it prevents this port from sending or receiving BPDUs (so if BPDUs are seen, they will be dropped)

After running the code in the exhibit. Which step reduces the amount of data that NETCONF server returns to the NETCONF client, to only the interface’s configuration?
A. Create an XML filter as a string and pass it to get_config() method as an argument
B. Use the txml library to parse the data returned by the NETCONF server for the interface’s configuration
C. Create a JSON filter as a string and pass it to the get_config() method as an argument
D. Use the JSON library to parse the data returned by the NETCONF server for the interface’s configuration
  
Answer: A
 
Explanation
 Sometimes we are only interested in a very particular part of the config. NETCONF accomodates this with the ability to specify a filter. In below script, we will specify a filter that only shows the information for interface GigabitEthernet3.
 The get_config also accepts a filter parameter (documentation). So in below script, we will simply pass that filter to the get_config method and see what happens.

Question 67
A network engineer configures BGP between R1 and R2. Both routers use BGP peer group CORP and are set up to use MD5 authentication. This message is logged to the console of router R1:

      *Jun 5 33:34:33.033: %TCP-6-BADAUTH: Invalid MD5 digest from 10.10.10.1 (29832) to 10.120.10.1 (179) tableid -0
   
Which two configurations allow a peering session to form between R1 and R2? (Choose two)

A.

 R1(config-router)#neighbor CORP password Cisco
D.
 R1(config-router)#neighbor 10.120.10.1 peer-group CORP
 R1(config-router)#neighbor CORP password Cisco
E.
 R2(config-router)#neighbor 10.120.10.1 peer-group CORP
 R2(config-router)#neighbor CORP password Cisco
  
Answer: CE
 
Explanation
 The above message (“...Invalid MD5 digest from 10.10.10.1 (29832) to 10.120.10.1...”) was received on R1 so we can deduce the IP address of R1 is 10.120.10.1 and the IP address of R2 is 10.10.10.1. Therefore on R1 we have to configure “neighbor 10.10.10.1 ...” while on R2 we have to use “neighbor 10.120.10.1 ...”
 
Question 68
Which device makes the decision for a wireless client to roam?
A. wireless client
B. access point
C. wireless LAN controller
D. WCS location server
  
Answer: A
 
Explanation
 Roaming is a client side decision in 802.11 WiFi. Client devices listen for beacon frames or send probe requests to discover APs advertising the preferred SSID. The clients driver uses the received signal strength of beacons or probe responses to make decisions on whether to change APs or remain connected to the current AP.

A network engineer configures a new GRE tunnel and enters the show run command. What does the output verify?
A. The tunnel keepalive is configured incorrectly because they must match on both sites
B. The tunnel destination will be known via the tunnel interface
C. The tunnel will be established and work as expected
D. The default MTU of the tunnel interface is 1500 byte.
  
Answer: B
 
Explanation
 GRE keepalive packets may be sent from both sides of a tunnel or from just one side. If they are sent from both sides, the period and retry parameters can be different at each side of the link -> Answer A is not correct.
 Tunnel interfaces by default will have 1476 bytes MTU. 24 bytes less the physical -> Answer D is not correct.
 In this question, we turned on OSPF on all active interfaces (with the “network 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255 area 0” command). So on SiteB the tunnel interface (192.168.100.2) is also running OSPF. When SiteA receives the OSPF advertisement from SiteB, it realizes it can reach the other side of the tunnel via OSPF (and it would not use the default route any more). In other words, it reaches the tunnel destination through the tunnel itself -> This causes “recursive routing” error.
 Note: In order to avoid this error, do not advertise the tunnel destination IP address on the tunnel interface to other side.

AAA Override - Off
Aironet IE - Off
Override ACL - None
DHCP Server - Off
NAC State - None

An engineer has configured Cisco ISE to assign VLANs to clients based on their method of authentication, but this is not working as expected. Which action will resolve this issue?
A. require a DHCP address assignment
B. utilize RADIUS profiling
C. set a NAC state
D. enable AAA override

Answer: D
 
Explanation
 Dynamic VLAN assignment is one such feature that places a wireless user into a specific VLAN based on the credentials supplied by the user. This task of assigning users to a specific VLAN is handled by a RADIUS authentication server,
 such as Cisco ISE. This can be used, for example, to allow the wireless host to remain on the same VLAN as it moves within a campus network.
 ...
 In order to accomplish dynamic VLAN assignment with WLCs based on ISE to AD group mapping, these steps must be performed:
 + ISE to AD integration and configuration of authentication and authorization policies for users on ISE

Question 82
If the noise floor is -90 dBm and the wireless client is receiving a signal of -75 dBm, what is the SNR?
A. -165
B. 83
C. 15
D. 1.2
  
Answer: C
 
Explanation
 If your SNR measurements are already in decibel form, then you can subtract the noise quantity from the desired signal: SNR = S – N. This is because when you subtract logarithms, it is the equivalent of dividing normal numbers.
 Also, the difference in the numbers equals the SNR. In this question, SNR = -75 – (-90) = 15.

Question 85
Which design principle states that a user has no access by default to any resource, and unless a resource is explicitly granted, it should be denied?
A. complete mediation
B. least privilege
C. economy of mechanism
D. fail-safe defaults
  
Answer: D
 
Explanation
 The Principle of Fail-Safe Defaults states that, unless a subject is given explicit access to an object, it should be denied access to that object.
 Note: By the principle of least privilege, that administrator should only be able to access the subjects and objects involved in mail queueing and delivery. As we saw, this minimizes the threats if that administrator’s account is compromised. The mail system can be damaged or destroyed, but nothing else can be.

%SPANTREE-7-RECV-1Q_NON_TRUNK: Received 802.1Q BPDU on non trunk Gig0/0 VLAN1
%SPANTREE-7-PORT_TYPE: Blocking Gig0/0 on VLAN1 Inconsistent port type

Switch1
vtp domain DATA1
int g0/0
switchport mode trunk

Switch2
vtp domain DATA2
int g0/0
switchport mode dynamic desirable

An engineer implemented several configuration changes and receives the logging message on Switch1. Which action should the engineer take to resolve this issue?
A. Change Switch1 to switch port mode dynamic desirable
B. Change Switch2 to switch port mode dynamic auto
C. Change Switch1 to switch port mode dynamic auto
D. Change the VTP domain to match on both switches
  
Answer: D
 
Explanation
 We can configure “switchport mode trunk” and “switchport mode dynamic desirable” on two ends with no problem. But trunking can be configured only when the ports belong to the same VTP domain.

Question 88
Refer to the exhibit.

SW2
int gig0/0
switchport trunk encap isl
switchport mode access
channel-group 1 mode active

int gig0/1
switchport trunk encap isl
switchport mode trunk
channel-group 1 mode active

SW3
int gig0/0
switchport trunk encap isl
switchport mode trunk
channel-group 1 mode passive

int gig0/1
switchport trunk encap isl
switchport mode trunk
channel-group 1 mode passive

The EtherChannel between SW2 and SW3 is not operational. Which action resolves this issue?
A. Configure the channel-group mode on SW2 Gi0/1 and Gi0/1 to on
B. Configure the channel-group mode on SW3 Gi0/1 to active
C. Configure the mode on SW2 Gi0/0 to trunk
D. Configure the mode on SW2 Gi0/1 to access
  
Answer: C
 
Explanation
 From the output of “show run interface gigabitethernet0/0” of SW2, we see interface G0/0 is in access mode so we have to change to trunk mode to match with the configuration of G0/1 interface of SW2.

Question 92
Refer to the exhibit.

   Gi1/0/20 1-4094
    
The trunk does not work over the back-to-back link between Switch1 interface Gig1/0/20 and Switch2 interface Gig1/0/20. Which configuration fixes the problem?
A. Switch2(config)#interface gig1/0/20
 Switch2(config-if)#switchport mode dynamic desirable
B. Switch1(config)#interface gig1/0/20
 Switch1(config-if)#switchport mode dynamic auto
C. Switch2(config)#interface gig1/0/20
 Switch2(config-if)#switchport mode dynamic auto
D. Switch2(config)#interface gig1/0/20
 Switch1(config-if)#switchport trunk native vlan 1
 Switch2(config)#interface gig1/0/20
 Switch2(config-if)#switchport trunk native vlan 1
  
Answer: A
 
Explanation
 From the output, we learn that both interfaces are in “auto” mode so they cannot establish a trunk. We have to change one (or both) of them to “desirable” mode.

Question 94 
What is the difference in dBm when an AP power increases from 25 mW to 100mW?
A. 75dBm
B. 150dBm
C. 6dBm
D. 125dBm
 
Answer: C
 
Explanation
 Formula to convert from mW to dBm:
 P(dBm) = 10log10(mW)
 Therefore:
 + 25mW converts to dBm: 10log10(25)= 13.98dBm
 + 100mW converts to dBm: 10log10(100) = 20dBm
 The difference between them is about 6dBm.
 Or a shorter way from the formula:
 logAB – logAC = logA(B/C)
 Then 10log10(100) – 10log10(25) = 10log10(100/25) = 10log10(4) = 6.02
 
Question 95

Question 98
Refer to the exhibit.

      psswd = (base64.b64decode(‘SzFwM001RzchCg==’). decode(‘utf-8’)).strip(‘/n’)
   d = datetime.date.today()
   date = str(10000*d.year + 100*d.month +D.day)
    
Refer to the exhibit. Which result does the python code achieve?
A. The code converts time to the yyyymmdd representation
B. The code encrypts a base64 decrypted password
C. The code converts time to the “year/month/day” time format
D. The code converts time to the Epoch LINUX time format
  
Answer: A
 
Explanation
 There are two results in the code above:
 + The first result is in the first line with “psswd” variable. The purpose of this line is to decrypt (not encrypt) an encrypted base64 string -> Answer B is not correct.
 + The second result is in the last line with “date” variable. Let’s take an example with the date 16th-Aug-2021 to see how the “date” variable is calculated:
 date = 10000 * 2021 + 100 * 8 + 16 = 20210000 + 800 + 16 = 20210816 -> Therefore the date is in yyyymmdd format.
  
Question 99
Which command is required to verify NETCONF capability reply messages?
A. show netconf | section rpc-reply
B. show netconf rpc-reply
C. show netconf xml rpc-reply
D. show netconf schema | section rpc-reply
  
Answer: D
 
Explanation
 The output of the show netconf schema command displays the element structure for a NETCONF request and the resulting reply. This schema can be used to construct proper NETCONF requests and parse the resulting replies.

 We tested this command under IOS-XE v16.05.01b and this is the result:
  Other commands are not correct:

The connection between SW1 and SW2 is not operational. Which two actions resolve the issue? (Choose two)
A. configure switchport mode access on SW2
B. configure switchport nonegotiate on SW2
C. configure switchport mode trunk on SW2
D. configure switchport mode dynamic desirable on SW2
E. configure no switchport nonegotiate on SW1
  
Answer: CD
 
Explanation
 From the outputs (line: “Administrative Mode: dynamic auto”) we notice that both interfaces were configured with “dynamic auto” mode so they cannot form a trunking link. We need to change one of them to “dynamic desirable” mode or “switchport mode trunk” to activate the trunk -> Answer C and answer D are correct.
 For your reference, the table below lists trunking condition:
  Note:
 In fact, there is an issue with the output of SW1 because both the command “switchport mode dynamic auto” mode (from the line: Administrative Mode: dynamic auto) and “switchport nonegotiate” (from the line: Negotiation of Trunking: Off) were used. But in practical we cannot use these two commands at the same time.
 – If the first command was entered and we use the second one, this error will be shown:
 “Command rejected: Conflict between ‘nonegotiate’ and ‘dynamic’ status on this interface: Et0/3”
 – If the second command was entered and we use the first one, this error will be shown:
 “Command rejected: An interface must be configured to the “Access” or “Trunk” modes to be configured to
 “NoNegotiate.””

Which Python code snippet prints the descriptions of disabled interfaces only?
   Option A
for int in netconf_data["GigabitEthernet"]
	print(interface["enabled"]
	print(interface["description"]

   Option B
for int in netconf_data["GigabitEthernet"]
	if interface["disabled"] != "true":
		print(interface["description"])

   Option C
for int in netconf_data["GigabitEthernet"]
	if interface["enabled"] != "true":
		print(interface["description"])

   Option D
for int in netconf_data["GigabitEthernet"]
	if interface["enabled"] != "false":
		print(interface["description"])

A. Option A
B. Option B
C. Option C
D. Option D
  
Answer: C
 
Explanation
 We need a “if” condition here to find out disabled interfaces so Option A is not correct.
 From the exhibit, we learn that the “netconf_data” array only has “enabled” element. It does not have “disabled” element so Option B is not correct.
 If “enabled” element is not “true” (interface[“enabled”] != ‘true’) then it is a disable interface -> Option C is correct.
 
Question 18
An engineer must deny HTTP traffic from host A to host B while allowing all other communication between the hosts. Drag and drop the commands into the configuration to achieve these results. Some commands may be used more than once. Not all commands are used.

ip access-list extended DENY-HTTP
______________ tcp host 10.1.1.10 host 10.1.1.20 eq www

ip access-list extended MATCH_ALL
______________ ip any any

vlan access-map HOST-A-B 10
match ip address DENY-HTTP
______________
vlan access-map HOST-A-B 20
match ip address MATCH_ALL
______________
vlan filter HOST-A-B vlan 10

A. action drop
B. action forward
C. filter
D. match
E. deny
F. permit

Answer: FFAB

Explanation
permit, permit, action drop, action forward

 In this case we need to configure a VLAN access-map to deny HTTP traffic and apply it to VLAN 10. To do it, first create an access-list, by which interesting traffic will be matched. The principle of VLAN access-map config is similar to the route-map principle.
 After this we’ll create a vlan access-map, which has two main parameters: action and match.
 Match: by this parameter the interesting traffic is matched and here RACL or MAC ACL can be applied as well.
 Action: what to do with matched traffic. Two main parameters exist: Drop and Forward. In case of Drop, matched traffic will be dropped, and in case of forward, matched traffic will be allowed.
 A good reference and example can be found at https://www.networkstraining.com/vlan-access-map-example-  configuration/
  In this question, we have to permit both ACL because the matched traffic will be decided by the VLAN Access map
 below (forward or drop).
 
Question 21
An engineer measures the Wi-Fi coverage at a customer site. The RSSI values are recorded as follows:
     
Location A: -72 dBm 
Location B: -75 dBm 
Location C: -65 dBm 
Location D: -80 dBm
  
Which two statements does the engineer use to explain these values to the customer? (Choose two)
A. The signal strength at location C is too weak to support web surfing
B. Location D has the strongest RF signal strength
C. The RF signal strength at location B is 50% weaker than location A
D. The signal strength at location B is 10 dB better than location C
E. The RF signal strength at location C is 10 times stronger than location B
  
Answer: CE
 
Explanation
 Understanding Signal Strength
 The most accurate way to express it is with milliwatts (mW), but you end up with tons of decimal places due to WiFi’s super-low transmit power, making it difficult to read. For example, -40 dBm is 0.0001 mW, and the zeros just get more intense the more the signal strength drops.
 Ultimately, the easiest and most consistent way to express signal strength is with dBm, which stands for decibels relative to a milliwatt.
 1 mW = 0 dBm
 You can convert between mW and dBm using the following formulas:
     P(dBm) = 10 · log10(P(mW))
For example, a power of 2.5 mW in dBm is: P(dBm) = 10log102.5 = 3.979
   dBm is that we’re working in negatives. -30 is a higher (stronger) signal than -80.
    Signal Strength
       Rating
            Required for
   -30 dBm
   Amazing
   Max achievable signal strength. The client can only be a few feet from the AP to achieve this. Not typical or desirable in the real world.
    N/A
    -67 dBm
   Very Good
 Minimum signal strength for applications that require very reliable, timely delivery of data packets.
   VoIP/VoWiFi, streaming video
    -70 dBm
       Okay
       Minimum signal strength for reliable packet delivery.
       Email, web
     -80 dBm
   Not Good
 Minimum signal strength for basic connectivity. Packet delivery may be unreliable.
   N/A
     -90 dBm
       Unusable
     Approaching or drowning in the noise floor. Any functionality is highly unlikely.
      N/A
    3 dB of gain = +3 dB = doubles signal strength (Let’s say, the base is P. So 10*log10(P/P)= 0 dB and
 10*log10(2P/P) = 10*log10(2) = 3dB -> double signal)
 3 dB of loss = -3 dB = halves signal strength strength (10*log(1⁄2) = -3.0103)
 10 dB of loss = -10 dB = 10 times less signal strength (0.1 mW = -10 dBm, 0.01 mW = -20 dBm, etc.)
 10 dB of gain = +10 dB = 10 times more signal strength (0.00001 mW = -50 dBm, 0.0001 mW = -40 dBm, etc.)
 Reference: https://www.metageek.com/training/resources/wifi-signal-strength-basics.html
  Simple rule of thumb:
 When working with power, 3 dB means double (twice) the factor and 10 dB means 10-fold.
 Note: In this question, answer A may be correct but it is not obvious. Also in this question, dB and dBm can be used interchangeable.

Question 23
 Which unit is used to express the signal-to-noise ratio?
A. dBm
B. dB
C. amp
D. mW
  
Answer: B
 
Explanation
 Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR or S/N) is the ratio of signal power to the noise power, and its unit of expression is typically decibels (dB).

Question 28
An engineer is configuring a GRE tunnel interface in the default mode. The engineer has assigned an IPv4 address on the tunnel and sourced the tunnel from an Ethernet interface. Which option also is required on the tunnel interface before it is operational?
A. (config-if)#tunnel destination {ip address}
B. (config-if)#keepalive {seconds retries}
C. (config-if)#ip mtu {value}
D. (config-if)#ip tcp adjust-mss {value}
  
Answer: A
 
Explanation
 A GRE interface definition includes:
 + An IPv4 address on the tunnel
 + A tunnel source
 + A tunnel destination
  
Below is an example of how to configure a basic GRE tunnel:
interface Tunnel 0
ip address 10.10.10.1 255.255.255.0 tunnel source fa0/0
tunnel destination 172.16.0.2
In this case the “IPv4 address on the tunnel” is 10.10.10.1/24 and “sourced the tunnel from an Ethernet interface” is
the command “tunnel source fa0/0”. Therefore it only needs a tunnel destination, which is 172.16.0.2.
Note: A multiple GRE (mGRE) interface does not require a tunnel destination address.

Question 3
Which protocol infers that a YANG data model is being used?
A. SNMP
B. REST
C. RESTCONF
D. NX-API

Answer: C

Explanation
YANG (Yet Another Next Generation) is a data modeling language for the definition of data sent over network management protocols such as the NETCONF and RESTCONF.

Question 9
Which two namespaces does the LISP network architecture and protocol use? (Choose two)
A. TLOC 
B. RLOC 
C. DNS
D. VTEP 
E. EID

Answer: BE 

Explanation
Locator ID Separation Protocol (LISP) is a network architecture and protocol that implements the use of two namespaces instead of a single IP address:
+ Endpoint identifiers (EIDs)—assigned to end hosts.
+ Routing locators (RLOCs)—assigned to devices (primarily routers) that make up the global routing system.

Question 10
Which First Hop Redundancy Protocol should be used to meet a design requirements for more efficient default bandwidth usage across multiple devices?

A. GLBP
B. LCAP 
C. HSRP 
D. VRRP

Answer: A

Explanation
The main disadvantage of HSRP and VRRP is that only one gateway is elected to be the active gateway and used to forward traffic whilst the rest are unused until the active one fails. Gateway Load Balancing Protocol (GLBP) is a Cisco proprietary protocol and performs the similar function to HSRP and VRRP but it supports load balancing among members in a GLBP group.

Question 12
What are two reasons why broadcast radiation is caused in the virtual machine environment? (Choose two)
A. vSwitch must interrupt the server CPU to process the broadcast packet 
B. The Layer 2 domain can be large in virtual machine environments
C. Virtual machines communicate primarily through broadcast mode
D. Communication between vSwitch and network switch is broadcast based 
E. Communication between vSwitch and network switch is multicast based

Answer: BC

Explanation
Broadcast radiation is the accumulation of broadcast and multicast traffic on a computer network. Extreme amounts of broadcast traffic constitute a broadcast storm.
The amount of broadcast traffic you should see within a broadcast domain is directly proportional to the size of the broadcast domain. Therefore if the layer 2 domain in virtual machine environment is too large, broadcast radiation may occur -> VLANs should be used to reduce broadcast radiation.
Also if virtual machines communicate via broadcast too much, broadcast radiation may occur.
Another reason for broadcast radiation is using a trunk (to extend VLANs) from the network switch to the physical server.
—————————————————————- Note about the structure of virtualization in a hypervisor:
Hypervisors provide virtual switch (vSwitch) that Virtual Machines (VMs) use to communicate with other VMs on the same host. The vSwitch may also be connected to the host’s physical NIC to allow VMs to get layer 2 access to the outside world.
Each VM is provided with a virtual NIC (vNIC) that is connected to the virtual switch. Multiple vNICs can connect to a single vSwitch, allowing VMs on a physical host to communicate with one another at layer 2 without having to go out to a physical switch.
Although vSwitch does not run Spanning-tree protocol but vSwitch implements other loop prevention mechanisms. For example, a frame that enters from one VMNIC is not going to go out of the physical host from a different VMNIC card.

Question 14
When a wireless client roams between two different wireless controllers, a network connectivity outage is experience for a period of time. Which configuration issue would cause this problem?

A. Not all of the controllers in the mobility group are using the same mobility group name
B. Not all of the controllers within the mobility group are using the same virtual interface IP address 
C. All of the controllers within the mobility group are using the same virtual interface IP address
D. All of the controllers in the mobility group are using the same mobility group name

Answer: B

Explanation
A prerequisite for configuring Mobility Groups is “All controllers must be configured with the same virtual interface IP address”. If all the controllers within a mobility group are not using the same virtual interface, inter- controller roaming may appear to work, but the handoff does not complete, and the client loses connectivity for a period of time. -> Answer B is correct.
Reference: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/wireless/controller/8-5/config- guide/b_cg85/mobility_groups.html
Answer A is not correct because when the client moves to a different mobility group (with different mobility group name), that client would be connected (provided that the new connected controller had information about this client in its mobility list already) or drop (if the new connected controller have not had information about this client in its mobility list). For more information please read the note below.
Note:
A mobility group is a set of controllers, identified by the same mobility group name, that defines the realm of seamless roaming for wireless clients. By creating a mobility group, you can enable multiple controllers in a network to dynamically share information and forward data traffic when inter-controller or inter-subnet roaming occurs. Controllers in the same mobility group can share the context and state of client devices as well as their list of access points so that they do not consider each other’s access points as rogue devices.
Let’s take an example:
The controllers in the ABC mobility group share access point and client information with each other. The controllers in the ABC mobility group do not share the access point or client information with the XYZ controllers, which are in a different mobility group. Therefore if a client from ABC mobility group moves to XYZ mobility group, and the new connected controller does not have information about this client in its mobility list, that client will be dropped.
Note: Clients may roam between access points in different mobility groups if the controllers are included in each other’s mobility lists.

Question 41
Which method of account authentication does OAuth 2.0 within REST APIs?
A. username/role combination 
B. access tokens
C. cookie authentication
D. basic signature workflow

Answer: B 

Explanation
The most common implementations of OAuth (OAuth 2.0) use one or both of these tokens:
+ access token: sent like an API key, it allows the application to access a user’s data; optionally, access tokens can expire.
+ refresh token: optionally part of an OAuth flow, refresh tokens retrieve a new access token if they have expired. OAuth2 combines Authentication and Authorization to allow more sophisticated scope and validity control.

Answer: C

Explanation
CoPP protects the route processor on network devices by treating route processor resources as a separate entity with its own ingress interface (and in some implementations, egress also). CoPP is used to police traffic that is destined to the route processor of the router such as:
+ Routing protocols like OSPF, EIGRP, or BGP.
+ Gateway redundancy protocols like HSRP, VRRP, or GLBP.
+ Network management protocols like telnet, SSH, SNMP, or RADIUS.
Therefore we must apply the CoPP to deal with SSH because it is in the management plane. CoPP must be put under “control-plane” command.

Question 5
What NTP stratum level is a server that is connected directly to an authoritative time source?
A. Stratum 0 
B. Stratum 1 
C. Stratum 14 
D. Stratum 15

Answer: B

Explanation
The stratum levels define the distance from the reference clock. A reference clock is a stratum 0 device that is assumed to be accurate and has little or no delay associated with it. Stratum 0 servers cannot be used on the network but they are directly connected to computers which then operate as stratum-1 servers. A stratum 1 time server acts as a primary network time standard.
A stratum 2 server is connected to the stratum 1 server; then a stratum 3 server is connected to the stratum 2 server and so on. A stratum 2 server gets its time via NTP packet requests from a stratum 1 server. A stratum 3 server gets its time via NTP packet requests from a stratum-2 server... A stratum server may also peer with other stratum servers at the same level to provide more stable and robust time for all devices in the peer group (for example a stratum 2 server can peer with other stratum 2 servers).
NTP uses the concept of a stratum to describe how many NTP hops away a machine is from an authoritative time source. A stratum 1 time server typically has an authoritative time source (such as a radio or atomic clock, or a Global Positioning System (GPS) time source) directly attached, a stratum 2 time server receives its time via NTP from a stratum 1 time server, and so on.

Question 1
A company plans to implement intent-based networking in its campus infrastructure. Which design facilities a migrate from a traditional campus design to a programmer fabric designer?
A. two-tier
B. Layer 2 access
C. three-tier
D. routed access

Answer: D

Explanation
An example of a Layer 3 Routed Access Design is shown below:

routed_access_topology.jpg

In a traditional campus design, the access layer is typically implemented using a Layer 2 switch with VLANs, and the distribution layer performs the routing between VLANs. In contrast, a programmable fabric design uses a routed access layer, where each access switch has an IP address and performs routing locally, eliminating the need for a separate distribution layer.

By implementing a routed access design, the company can gradually migrate from a traditional campus design to a programmable fabric design. The Layer 2 access and two-tier designs are both traditional campus designs and do not facilitate the migration to a programmable fabric design. The three-tier design includes a distribution layer, which is not needed in a programmable fabric design with routed access.

Question 2

Question 3
Which algorithms are used to secure REST API from brute attacks and minimize the impact?
A. SHA-1, SHA-256, and SHA-512
B. PBKDF2, BCrypt, and SCrypt
C. SHA-512 and SHA-384
D. MD5 algorithm-128 and SHA-384

Answer: B

Explanation
One of the best practices to secure REST APIs is using password hash. Passwords must always be hashed to protect the system (or minimize the damage) even if it is compromised in some hacking attempts. There are many such hashing algorithms which can prove really effective for password securityE.g. PBKDF2, bcrypt and scrypt algorithms.
Other ways to secure REST APIs are: Always use HTTPS, Never expose information on URLs (Usernames, passwords, session tokens, and API keys should not appear in the URL), Adding Timestamp in Request, Using OAuth, Input Parameter Validation.
Reference: https://restfulapi.net/security-essentials/
We should not use MD5 or any SHA (SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-512...) algorithm to hash
password as they are not totally secure.
Note: answer 'SHA-512 and SHA-384' brute-force attack is an attempt to discover a password by systematically trying every possible combination of letters, numbers, and symbols until you discover the one correct combination that works.

Answer: C

Explanation
CoPP protects the route processor on network devices by treating route processor resources as a separate entity with its own ingress interface (and in some implementations, egress also). CoPP is used to police traffic that is destined to the route processor of the router such as:
+ Routing protocols like OSPF, EIGRP, or BGP.
+ Gateway redundancy protocols like HSRP, VRRP, or GLBP.
+ Network management protocols like telnet, SSH, SNMP, or RADIUS.

 Therefore we must apply the CoPP to deal with SSH because it is in the management plane. CoPP must be put under “control-plane” command. But we cannot name the control-plane (like "transit").

Question 12
What is the role of the RP in PIM sparse mode?
A. The RP responds to the PIM join messages with the source of requested multicast group
B. The RP maintains default aging timeouts for all multicast streams requested by the receivers
C. The RP acts as a control-plane node and does not receive or forward multicast packets
D. The RP is the multicast router that is the root of the PIM-SM shared multicast distribution tree

Answer: D

Explanation

The concept of joining the rendezvous point (RP) is called the RPT (Root Path Tree) or shared distribution tree. The RP is the root of our tree which decides where to forward multicast traffic to. Each multicast group might have different sources and receivers so we might have different RPTs in our network.

Question 13
What are two device roles in Cisco SD-Access fabric? (Choose two)
A. access switch
B. border node
C. edge node
D. core switch
E. vBond controller

Answer: BC

Explanation
There are five basic device roles in the fabric overlay:
+ Control plane node: This node contains the settings, protocols, and mapping tables to provide the endpoint-to-location (EID-to-RLOC) mapping system for the fabric overlay. + Fabric border node: This fabric device (for example, core layer device) connects external Layer 3 networks to the SDA fabric.
+ Fabric edge node: This fabric device (for example, access or distribution layer device) connects wired endpoints to the SDA fabric.
+ Fabric WLAN controller (WLC): This fabric device connects APs and wireless endpoints to the SDA fabric.
+ Intermediate nodes: These are intermediate routers or extended switches that do not provide any sort of SD-Access fabric role other than underlay services.

Question 14
A network administrator is preparing a Python script to configure a Cisco IOS XE-based device on the network. The administrator is worried that colleagues will make changes to the device while the script is running. Which operation of the client manager in prevent colleague making changes to the device while the script is running?
A. m.freeze(target=’running’)
B. m.lock(config=’running’)
C. m.freeze(config=’running’)
D. m.lock(target=’running’)

Answer: D

Explanation
The example below shows the usage of lock command:
def demo(host, user, names):
    with manager.connect(host=host, port=22, username=user) as m:

        with m.locked(target=’running’):
            for n in names:
                m.edit_config(target=’running’, config=template % n)
the command “m.locked(target=’running’)” causes a lock to be acquired on the running datastore.

Question 4
Which devices does Cisco Center configure when deploying an IP-based access control policy?
A. all wired devices
B. All devices integrating with ISE
C. selected individual devices
D. all devices in selected sites

Answer: B

Explanation

Reference: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/cloud-systems-management/network- automation-and-management/dna-center/1-3-1- 0/user_guide/b_cisco_dna_center_ug_1_3_1_0/b_cisco_dna_center_ug_1_3_1_0_chapte r_01011.html

Question 8
A network administrator applies the following configuration to an IOS device.

aaa new-model
aaa authentication login default local group tacacs+

What is the process of password checks when a login attempt is made to the device?
A. A local database is checked first. If that check fails, a TACACS+server is checked
B. A TACACS+ server is checked first. If that check fail, a database is checked
C. A local database is checked first. If that fails, a TACACS+server is checked, if
that check fails, a RADIUS server is checked
D. A TACACS+ server is checked first. If that check fail, a RADIUS server is
checked. If that check fail, a local database is checked 

Answer: A

Explanation
The “aaa authentication login default local group tacacs+” command is broken down as follows:
+ The ‘aaa authentication’ part is simply saying we want to configure authentication settings.
+ The ‘login’ is stating that we want to prompt for a username/password when a connection is made to the device.
+ The ‘default’ means we want to apply for all login connections (such as tty, vty, console and aux). If we use this keyword, we don’t need to configure anything else under tty, vty and aux lines. If we don’t use this keyword then we have to specify which line(s) we want to apply the authentication feature.
+ The ‘local group tacacs+” means all users are authenticated using router’s local database (the first method). If the credentials are not found on the local database, then the TACACS+ server is used (the second method).

Question 10
Drag and drop the REST API authentication method from the left to the description on the right.
A.

Answer: ABCDEFGHIJKLM

Explanation
+ public API resource: secure vault
+ username and password in an encoded string: HTTP basic authentication
+ API-dependent secret: token-based authentication
+ authorization through identity provider: OAuth

When Secure Vault is not in use, all information stored in its container is encrypted. When a user wants to use the files and notes stored within the app, they have to first decrypt the database. This happens by filling in a previously determined Security Lock – which could be a PIN or a password of the user’s choosing.

When a user leaves the app, it automatically encrypts everything again. This way all data stored in Secure Vault is decrypted only while a user is actively using the app. In all other instances, it remains locked to any attacker, malware or spyware trying to access the data.

How token-based authentication works: Users log in to a system and – once authenticated – are provided with a token to access other services without having to enter their username and password multiple times. In short, token-based authentication adds a second layer of security to application, network, or service access.

OAuth is an open standard for authorization used by many APIs and modern applications. The simplest example of OAuth is when you go to log onto a website and it offers one or more opportunities to log on using another website’s/service’s logon. You then click on the button linked to the other website, the other website authenticates you, and the website you were originally connecting to logs you on itself afterward using permission gained from the second website.

Question 12
A client device roams between access points located on different floors in an atrium. The access points joined to the same controller and configuration in local mode. The access points are in different IP addresses, but the client VLAN in the group same. What type of roam occurs?
A. intra-controller
B. inter-subnet
C. intra-VLAN
D. inter-controller

Answer: B

Explanation
Mobility, or roaming, is a wireless LAN client’s ability to maintain its association seamlessly from one access point to another securely and with as little latency as possible. Three popular types of client roaming are:
Intra-Controller Roaming: Each controller supports same-controller client roaming across access points managed by the same controller. This roaming is transparent to the client as the session is sustained, and the client continues using the same DHCP-assigned or client-assigned IP address.
Inter-Controller Roaming: Multiple-controller deployments support client roaming across access points managed by controllers in the same mobility group and on the same subnet. This roaming is also transparent to the client because the session is sustained and a tunnel between controllers allows the client to continue using the same DHCP- or client-assigned IP address as long as the session remains active.
Inter-Subnet Roaming: Multiple-controller deployments support client roaming across access points managed by controllers in the same mobility group on different subnets. This roaming is transparent to the client because the session is sustained and a tunnel between the controllers allows the client to continue using the same DHCP-assigned or client-assigned IP address as long as the session remains active.

Question 22
An engineer must protect their company against ransom ware attacks. Which solution allows the engineer to block the execution stage and prevent file encryption?
A. Use Cisco AMP deployment with the Exploit Prevention engine enabled
B. Use Cisco Firepower with Intrusion Policy and snort rules blocking SMB
exploitation
C. Use Cisco AMP deployment with the Malicious Activity Protection engineer enabled
D. Use Cisco Firepower and block traffic to TOR networks 

Answer: C

Explanation
Ransomware are malicious software that locks up critical resources of the users. Ransomware uses well-established public/private key cryptography which leaves the only way of recovering the files being the payment of the ransom, or restoring files from backups.
Cisco Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) for Endpoints Malicious Activity Protection (MAP) engine defends your endpoints by monitoring the system and identifying processes that exhibit malicious activities when they execute and stops them from running. Because the MAP engine detects threats by observing the behavior of the process at run time, it can generically determine if a system is under attack by a new variant of ransomware or malware that may have eluded other security products and detection technology, such as legacy signature-based malware detection. The first release of the MAP engine targets identification, blocking, and quarantine of ransomware attacks on the endpoint.

Question 30
Wireless users report frequent disconnections from the wireless network. While troubleshooting a network engineer finds that after the user a disconnect, the connection reestablishes automatically without any input required. The engineer also notices these message logs.

AP ‘AP2’ is down Reason: Radio channel set. 6:54:04 PM 
AP ‘AP4’ is down Reason: Radio channel set. 6:44:49 PM 
AP ‘AP7’ is down Reason: Radio channel set. 6:34:32 PM
  
Which action reduces the user impact?
A. increase BandSelect
B. enable coverage hole detection
C. increase the AP heartbeat timeout
D. increase the dynamic channel assignment interval

Answer: D

Explanation
These message logs inform that the radio channel has been reset (and the AP must be down briefly). With dynamic channel assignment (DCA), the radios can frequently switch from one channel to another but it also makes disruption. The default DCA interval is 10 minutes, which is matched with the time of the message logs. By increasing the DCA interval, we can reduce the number of times our users are disconnected for changing radio channels.

Question 2
What is calculated using the numerical values of the transmitter power level, cable loss and antenna gain?
A. SNR
B. RSSI
C. dBi
D. EIRP

Answer: D

Explanation
Once you know the complete combination of transmitter power level, the length of cable, and the antenna gain, you can figure out the actual power level that will be radiated from the antenna. This is known as the effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP), measured in dBm.
EIRP is a very important parameter because it is regulated by governmental agencies in most countries. In those cases, a system cannot radiate signals higher than a maximum allowable EIRP. To find the EIRP of a system, simply add the transmitter power level to the antenna gain and subtract the cable loss.
EIRP = Tx Power – Tx Cable + Tx Antenna
Suppose a transmitter is configured for a power level of 10 dBm (10 mW). answer 'SNR' cable with 5-dB loss connects the transmitter to an antenna with an 8-dBi gain. The resulting EIRP of the system is 10 dBm – 5 dB + 8 dBi, or 13 dBm.
You might notice that the EIRP is made up of decibel-milliwatt (dBm), dB relative to an isotropic antenna (dBi), and decibel (dB) values. Even though the units appear to be differrent, you can safely combine them because they are all in the dB “domain”.

Question 2

What does the LAP send when multiple WLCs respond to the CISCO-CAPWAP-CONTROLLER.localdomain hostname during the CAPWAP discovery and join process?
A. unicast discovery request to the first WLC that resolves the domain name
B. broadcast discovery request
C. join request to all the WLCs
D. unicast discovery request to each WLC

Answer: D

Explanation
The Lightweight AP (LAP) can discover controllers through your domain name server (DNS). For the access point (AP) to do so, you must configure your DNS to return controller IP addresses in response to CISCO-LWAPP-CONTROLLER.localdomain, where localdomain is the AP domain name. When an AP receives an IP address and DNS information from a DHCP server, it contacts the DNS to resolve CISCO-CAPWAP-CONTROLLER.localdomain. When the DNS sends a list of controller IP addresses, the AP sends discovery requests to the controllers.
The AP will attempt to resolve the DNS name CISCO-CAPWAP-CONTROLLER.localdomain. When the AP is able to resolve this name to one or more IP addresses, the AP sends a unicast CAPWAP Discovery Message to the resolved IP address(es). Each WLC that receives the CAPWAP Discovery Request Message replies with a unicast CAPWAP Discovery Response to the AP.

Question 5A
DRAG DROP
Drag and drop the descriptions from the left onto the correct QoS components on the right.
Which of the following relate to traffic policing? (Choose three)
A. drops excessive traffic
B. buffers excessive traffic
C. introduces no delay and jitter
D. causes TCP retransmission when traffic is dropped
E. typically delays, rather than drops traffic
F. introduces delay and jitter

Answer: ACD

Explanation
Policers for incoming traffic are most optimally deployed at the edge of the network to keep traffic from wasting valuable bandwidth in the core of the network. Policers for outbound traffic are most optimally deployed at the edge of the network or core-facing interfaces on network edge devices. A downside
of policing is that it causes TCP retransmissions when it drops traffic.
Shapers are used for egress traffic and typically deployed by enterprise networks on service provider (SP)–facing interfaces. Shaping is useful in cases where SPs are policing incoming traffic or when SPs are not policing traffic but do have a maximum traffic rate SLA, which, if violated, could incur monetary penalties. Shaping buffers and delays traffic rather than dropping it, and this causes fewer TCP retransmissions compared to policing.


Question 5B
DRAG DROP
Drag and drop the descriptions from the left onto the correct QoS components on the right.
Which of the following relate to traffic shaping? (Choose three)
A. drops excessive traffic
B. buffers excessive traffic
C. introduces no delay and jitter
D. causes TCP retransmission when traffic is dropped
E. typically delays, rather than drops traffic
F. introduces delay and jitter

Answer: BEF

Explanation
Policers for incoming traffic are most optimally deployed at the edge of the network to keep traffic from wasting valuable bandwidth in the core of the network. Policers for outbound traffic are most optimally deployed at the edge of the network or core-facing interfaces on network edge devices. A downside
of policing is that it causes TCP retransmissions when it drops traffic.

Question 9A
Drag and drop the LISP components from the left onto the functions they perform on the right. Not all options are used.
Which one describes a LISP proxy ETR?
A. It accepts LISP encapsulated map requests
B. It learns of EID prefix mapping entries from an ETR
C. It receives traffic from LISP sites and sends it to non-LISP sites
D. It receives packets from site-facing interfaces

Answer: C

Explanation
ETR is the function that receives LISP encapsulated packets, decapsulates them and forwards to its local EIDs.This function also requires EID-to-RLOC mappings so we need to point out an “map-server” IP address and the key (password) for authentication.
A LISP proxy ETR (PETR) implements ETR functions on behalf of non-LISP sites. A PETR is typically used when a LISP site needs to send traffic to non-LISP sites but the LISP site is connected through a service provider that does not accept nonroutable EIDs as packet sources. PETRs act just like ETRs but for EIDs that send traffic to destinations at non-LISP sites.

Question 9B

Which one describes a LISP map resolver?
A. It receives packets from site-facing interfaces
B. It accepts LISP encapsulated map requests
C. It receives traffic from LISP sites and sends it to non-LISP sites
D. It learns of EID prefix mapping entries from an ETR

Answer: B

Explanation
Map Resolver (MR): a LISP component which accepts LISP Encapsulated Map Requests, typically from an ITR, quickly determines whether or not the destination IP address is part of the EID namespace.


Question 9C
Drag and drop the LISP components from the left onto the functions they perform on the right. Not all options are used.
Which one describes a LISP map server?
A. It accepts LISP encapsulated map requests
B. It learns of EID prefix mapping entries from an ETR
C. It receives traffic from LISP sites and sends it to non-LISP sites
D. It receives packets from site-facing interfaces

Answer: B

Explanation
Map Server (MS) processes the registration of authentication keys and EID-to-RLOC mappings. ETRs sends periodic Map-Register messages to all its configured Map Servers.

Question 9D
Drag and drop the LISP components from the left onto the functions they perform on the right. Not all options are used.
Which one describes a LISP ITR?
A. It accepts LISP encapsulated map requests
B. It learns of EID prefix mapping entries from an ETR
C. It receives traffic from LISP sites and sends it to non-LISP sites
D. It receives packets from site-facing interfaces

Answer: D

Explanation
ITR is the function that maps the destination EID to a destination RLOC and then encapsulates the original packet with an additional header that has the source IP address of the ITR RLOC and the destination IP address of the RLOC of an Egress Tunnel Router (ETR). After the encapsulation, the original packet become a LISP packet.
ETR is the function that receives LISP encapsulated packets, decapsulates them and forwards to its local EIDs.This function also requires EID-to-RLOC mappings so we need to point out an “map-server” IP address and the key (password) for authentication.

Question 14
What is the role of the vSmart controller in a Cisco SD-WAN environment?
A. It performs authentication and authorization.
B. It manages the control plane.
C. It is the centralized network management system.
D. It manages the data plane.

Answer: B

Explanation
vSmart controllers also implement all the control plane policies created on vManage, such as service chaining, traffic engineering, and segmentation per VPN topology. vSmart converts the policy into a format that all the SD-WAN routers in the fabric can understand, and it automatically implements the policy on all SD-WAN routers without the need to rely on a CLI. The vSmart controller also works in conjunction with the vBond orchestrator to authenticate the devices as they join the network and to orchestrate connectivity between the SD-WAN routers.

Question 18
Which access point mode allows a supported AP to function like a WLAN client would, associating and identifying client connectivity issues?
A. client mode
B. SE-connect mode
C. sensor mode
D. sniffer mode

Answer: C

Explanation
Monitor: The AP does not transmit at all, but its receiver is enabled to act as a dedicated sensor. The AP checks for IDS events, detects rogue access points, and determines the position of stations through location-based services.
Sniffer: An AP dedicates its radios to receiving 802.11 traffic from other sources, much like a sniffer or packet capture device. The captured traffic is then forwarded to a PC running network analyzer software such as LiveAction Omnipeek or Wireshark, where it can be analyzed further.
SE-Connect: The AP dedicates its radios to spectrum analysis on all wireless channels. You can remotely connect a PC running software such as MetaGeek Chanalyzer or Cisco Spectrum Expert to the AP to collect and analyze the spectrum analysis data to discover sources of interference.

Lo0:10.2.2.2               Lo0:10.3.3.3

An engineer must deny Telnet traffic from the loopback interface of router R3 to the loopback interface of router R2 during the weekend hours. All other traffic between the loopback interfaces of routers R3 and R2 must be allowed at all times.
Which command set accomplishes this task?
A. R3(config)#time-range WEEKEND
R3(config-time-range)#periodic Saturday Sunday 00:00 to 23:59

R1(config)#interface G0/1
R1(config-if)#ip access-group 150 in

Answer: B

Explanation
We cannot filter traffic that is originated from the local router (R3 in this case) so we can only configure the ACL on R1 or R2. “Weekend hours” means from Saturday morning through Sunday night so we have to configure: “periodic weekend 00:00 to 23:59”.
Note: The time is specified in 24-hour time (hh:mm), where the hours range from 0 to 23 and the minutes range from 0 to 59.

Question 22
Which tool is used in Cisco DNA Center to build generic configurations that are able to be applied on devices with similar network settings?
A. Command Runner
B. Application Policies
C. Template Editor
D. Authentication Template

Answer: C

Explanation
Cisco DNA Center provides an interactive editor called Template Editor to author CLI templates. Template Editor is a centralized CLI management tool to help design a set of device configurations that you need to build devices in a branch. When you have a site, office, or branch that uses a similar set of devices and configurations, you can use Template Editor to build generic configurations and apply the configurations to one or more devices in the branch.

A network engineer is configuring OSPF between router R1 and router R2. The engineer must ensure that a DR/BDR election does not occur on the Gigabit Ethernet interfaces in area 0.
Which configuration set accomplishes this goal?
A. R1(config-if)interface Gi0/0
R1(config-if)ip ospf network point-to-point
R2(config-if)interface Gi0/0
R2(config-if)ip ospf network point-to-point
B. R1(config-if)interface Gi0/0
R1(config-if)ip ospf network broadcast
R2(config-if)interface Gi0/0
R2(config-if)ip ospf network broadcast
C. R1(config-if)interface Gi0/0
R1(config-if)ip ospf database-filter all out
R2(config-if)interface Gi0/0
R2(config-if)ip ospf database-filter all out
D. R1(config-if)interface Gi0/0 
R1(config-if)ip ospf priority 1
R2(config-if)interface Gi0/0
R2(config-if)ip ospf priority 1

Answer: A

Explanation
Broadcast and Non-Broadcast networks elect DR/BDR while Point-to-point/multipoint do not elect DR/BDR. Therefore we have to set the two Gi0/0 interfaces to point-to-point or point-to-multipoint network to ensure that a DR/BDR election does not occur.

service-policy input CoPP_SSH !
ip access-list extended CoPP_SSH permit tcp any any eq 22
!

Answer: C

Explanation
CoPP protects the route processor on network devices by treating route processor resources as a separate entity with its own ingress interface (and in some implementations, egress also). CoPP is used to police traffic that is destined to the route processor of the router such as:
+ Routing protocols like OSPF, EIGRP, or BGP.
+ Gateway redundancy protocols like HSRP, VRRP, or GLBP.
+ Network management protocols like telnet, SSH, SNMP, or RADIUS.

 Therefore we must apply the CoPP to deal with SSH because it is in the management plane. CoPP must be put under “control-plane” command. But we cannot name the control-plane (like "transit").

Question 32
A client device roams between access points located on different floors in an atrium. The access points are joined to the same controller and configured in local mode. The access points are in different AP groups and have different IP addresses, but the client VLAN in the groups is the same.
What type of roam occurs?
A. inter-controller
B. inter-subnet
C. intra-VLAN
D. intra-controller

Answer: D

Explanation
Three popular types of client roaming are:
Intra-Controller Roaming: Each controller supports same-controller client roaming across access points managed by the same controller. This roaming is transparent to the client as the session is sustained, and the client continues using the same DHCP-assigned or client-assigned IP address.
Inter-Controller Roaming: Multiple-controller deployments support client roaming across access points managed by controllers in the same mobility group and on the same subnet. This roaming is also transparent to the client because the session is sustained and a tunnel between controllers allows the client to continue using the same DHCP- or client-assigned IP address as long as the session remains active.
Inter-Subnet Roaming: Multiple-controller deployments support client roaming across access points managed by controllers in the same mobility group on different subnets. This roaming is transparent to the client because the session is sustained and a tunnel between the controllers allows the client to continue using the same DHCP-assigned or client-assigned IP address as long as the session remains active.

Question 33
Which component handles the orchestration plane of the Cisco SD-WAN?
A. vBond
B. vSmart
C. vManage
D. vEdge

Answer: A

Explanation
+ Orchestration plane (vBond) assists in securely onboarding the SD-WAN WAN Edge routers into the SD-WAN overlay. The vBond controller, or orchestrator, authenticates and authorizes the SD-WAN components onto the network. The vBond orchestrator takes an added responsibility to distribute the list of vSmart and vManage controller information to the WAN Edge routers. vBond is the only device in SD-WAN that requires a public IP address as it is the first point of contact and authentication for all SD-WAN components to join the SD-WAN fabric. All other components need to know the vBond IP or DNS information.

Question 35
An engineer is describing QoS to a client.
Which two facts apply to traffic policing? (Choose two.)
A. Policing should be performed as close to the source as possible.
B. Policing adapts to network congestion by queuing excess traffic.
C. Policing should be performed as close to the destination as possible.
D. Policing drops traffic that exceeds the defined rate.
E. Policing typically delays the traffic, rather than drops it.

Answer: AD

Explanation
Traffic policing propagates bursts. When the traffic rate reaches the configured maximum rate (or committed information rate), excess traffic is dropped (or remarked). The result is an output rate that appears as a saw-tooth with crests and troughs.
Unlike traffic shaping, traffic policing does not cause delay.
Classification (which includes traffic policing, traffic shaping and queuing techniques) should take place at the network edge. It is recommended that classification occur as close to the source of the traffic as possible.
Also according to this Cisco link, “policing traffic as close to the source as possible”. 

Question 39
How does QoS traffic shaping alleviate network congestion?
A. It drops packets when traffic exceeds a certain bitrate.
B. It buffers and queues packets above the committed rate.
C. It fragments large packets and queues them for delivery.
D. It drops packets randomly from lower priority queues.

Answer: B

Explanation
Traffic shaping retains excess packets in a queue and then schedules the excess for later transmission over increments of time. The result of traffic shaping is a smoothed packet output rate.

Question 44
Which action is a function of VTEP in VXLAN?
A. tunneling traffic from IPv6 to IPv4 VXLANs
B. allowing encrypted communication on the local VXLAN Ethernet segment
C. encapsulating and de-encapsulating VXLAN Ethernet frames
D. tunneling traffic from IPv4 to IPv6 VXLANs

Answer: C

Explanation
VTEPs connect between Overlay and Underlay network and they are responsible for encapsulating frame into VXLAN packets to send across IP network (Underlay) then decapsulating when the packets leaves the VXLAN tunnel.

    10.3.3.3        10.4.4.4
              AS200

An engineer must ensure that all traffic leaving AS 200 will choose Link 2 as the exit point.
Assuming that all BGP neighbor relationships have been formed and that the attributes have not been changed on any of the routers, which configuration accomplishes this task?
A. R4(config-router)bgp default local-preference 200
B. R3(config-router)bgp default local-preference 200
C. R4(config-router)neighbor 10.2.2.2 weight 200
D. R3(config-router)neighbor 10.1.1.1 weight 200

Answer: A

Explanation
Local preference is an indication to the AS about which path has preference to exit the AS in order to reach a certain network. A path with a higher local preference is preferred. The default value for local preference is 100.

Unlike the weight attribute, which is only relevant to the local router, local preference is an attribute that routers exchange in the same AS. The local preference is set with the “bgp default local-preference value” command.

In this case, both R3 & R4 have exit links but R4 has higher local-preference so R4 will be chosen as the preferred exit point from AS 200.

Question 60
What is the difference between the enable password and the enable secret password when service password encryption is enabled on an IOS device?
A. The enable secret password is protected via stronger cryptography mechanisms.
B. The enable password cannot be decrypted.
C. The enable password is encrypted with a stronger encryption method.
D. There is no difference and both passwords are encrypted identically.

Answer: A

Explanation
The “enable secret” password is always encrypted (independent of the “service passwordencryption” command) using MD5 hash algorithm. The “enable password” does not encrypt the password and can be view in clear text in the running-config. In order to encrypt the “enable password”, use the “service password-encryption” command. This command will encrypt the passwords by using the Vigenere encryption algorithm. Unfortunately, the Vigenere encryption method is cryptographically weak and trivial to reverse.
The MD5 hash is a stronger algorithm than Vigenere so answer ‘The enable secret password is protected via stronger cryptography mechanisms’ is correct.

What is the role of a fusion router in an SD-Access solution?
A. acts as a DNS server
B. provides additional forwarding capacity to the fabric
C. performs route leaking between user-defined virtual networks and shared services
D. provides connectivity to external networks

Answer: C

Explanation
Today the Dynamic Network Architecture Software Defined Access (DNA-SDA) solution requires a fusion router to perform VRF route leaking between user VRFs and Shared-Services, which may be in the Global routing table (GRT) or another VRF. Shared Services may consist of DHCP, Domain Name System (DNS), Network Time Protocol (NTP), Wireless LAN Controller (WLC), Identity Services Engine (ISE), DNAC components which must be made available to other virtual networks (VN’s) in the Campus.

Question 73
Which DNS lookup does an access point perform when attempting CAPWAP discovery?
A. CISCO-CONTROLLER.local
B. CAPWAP-CONTROLLER.local
C. CISCO-CAPWAP-CONTROLLER.local
D. CISCO-DNA-CONTROLLER.local

Answer: C

Explanation
The Lightweight AP (LAP) can discover controllers through your domain name server (DNS). For the access point (AP) todo so, you must configure your DNS to return controller IP addresses in response to CISCO-LWAPP-CONTROLLER.localdomain, where localdomain is the AP domain name. When an AP receives an IP address and DNSinformation from a DHCP server, it contacts the DNS to resolve CISCOCAPWAP-CONTROLLER.localdomain. When theDNS sends a list of controller IP addresses, the AP sends discovery requests to the controllers.
The AP will attempt to resolve the DNS name CISCO-CAPWAP-CONTROLLER.localdomain. When the AP is able toresolve this name to one or more IP addresses, the AP sends a unicast CAPWAP Discovery Message to the resolved IPaddress(es). Each WLC that receives the CAPWAP Discovery Request Message replies with a unicast CAPWAP DiscoveryResponse to the AP.

Question 74
Which TCP setting is tuned to minimize the risk of fragmentation on a GRE/IP tunnel?
A. MSS
B. MTU
C. MRU
D. window size

Answer: A

Explanation
The TCP Maximum Segment Size (TCP MSS) defines the maximum amount of data that a host is willing to accept in a single TCP/IP datagram. This TCP/IP datagram might be fragmented at the IP layer. The MSS value is sent as a TCP header option only in TCP SYN segments. Each side of a TCP connection reports its MSS value to the other side. Contrary to popular belief, the MSS value is not negotiated between hosts. The sending host is required to limit the size of data in a single TCP segment to a value less than or equal to the MSS reported by the receiving host.
TCP MSS takes care of fragmentation at the two endpoints of a TCP connection, but it does not handle the case where there is a smaller MTU link in the middle between these two endpoints. PMTUD was developed in order to avoid fragmentation in the path between the endpoints. It is used to dynamically determine the lowest MTU along the path from a packet’s source to its destination.

Question 77
What is a fact about Cisco EAP-FAST?
A. It requires a client certificate.
B. It is an IETF standard.
C. It does not require a RADIUS server certificate.
D. It operates in transparent mode.

Question 87
How do agent-based versus agentless configuration management tools compare?
A. Agentless tools use proxy nodes to interface with slave nodes.
B. Agentless tools require no messaging systems between master and slaves.
C. Agent-based tools do not require a high-level language interpreter such as Python or Ruby on slave nodes.
D. Agent-based tools do not require installation of additional software packages on the slave nodes.

Answer: B

Explanation
Agentless tool means that no software or agent needs to be installed on the client machines that are to be managed. Ansible is such an agentless tool. In contrast to agentless tool, agent-based tool requires software or agent to be installed on the client. Therefore the master and slave nodes can communicate directly without the need of high-level language interpreter.
An agentless tool uses standard protocols, such as SSH, to push configurations down to a device (and it can be considered a “messaging system”).

Which statement about TLS is true when using RESTCONF to write configurations on network devices?
A. It is used for HTTP and HTTPS requests.
B. It requires certificates for authentication.
C. It is provided using NGINX acting as a proxy web server.
D. It is not supported on Cisco devices.

Answer: C

Explanation
When a device boots up with the startup configuration, the nginx process will be running. NGINX is an internal webserver that acts as a proxy webserver. It provides Transport Layer Security (TLS)-based HTTPS. RESTCONF request sent via HTTPS is first received by the NGINX proxy web server, and the request is transferred to the confd web server for further syntax/semantics check.

Question 90
Which reason could cause an OSPF neighborship to be in the EXSTART/EXCHANGE state?
A. mismatched OSPF link costs
B. mismatched OSPF network type
C. mismatched areas
D. mismatched MTU size

Answer: D

Explanation
When OSPF adjacency is formed, a router goes through several state changes before it becomes fully adjacent with its neighbor. The states are Down -> Attempt (optional) -> Init -> 2-Way -> Exstart -> Exchange -> Loading -> Full. Short descriptions about these states are listed below:
Down: no information (hellos) has been received from this neighbor.
Attempt: only valid for manually configured neighbors in an NBMA environment. In Attempt state, the router sends unicast hello packets every poll interval to the neighbor, from which hellos have not been received within the dead interval.
Init: specifies that the router has received a hello packet from its neighbor, but the receiving router’s ID was not included in the hello packet
2-Way: indicates bi-directional communication has been established between two routers.
Exstart: Once the DR and BDR are elected, the actual process of exchanging link state information can start between the routers and their DR and BDR.
Exchange: OSPF routers exchange database descriptor (DBD) packets
Loading: In this state, the actual exchange of link state information occurs Full: routers are fully adjacent with each other (Reference:
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk365/technologies_tech_note09186a0080093f0e.s html)
Neighbors Stuck in Exstart/Exchange State the problem occurs most frequently when attempting to run OSPF between a Cisco router and another vendor’s router. The problem occurs when the maximum transmission unit (MTU) settings for neighboring router interfaces don’t match. If the router with the higher MTU sends a packet larger that the MTU set on the neighboring router, the neighboring router ignores the packet.

Question 93
Which controller is the single plane of management for Cisco SD-WAN?
A. vBond
B. vSmart
C. vManage
D. vEdge

Answer: C

Explanation
The primary components for the Cisco SD-WAN solution consist of the vManage network management system (management plane), the vSmart controller (control plane), the vBond orchestrator (orchestration plane), and the vEdge router (data plane).
+ vManage – This centralized network management system provides a GUI interface to easily monitor, configure, and maintain all Cisco SD-WAN devices and links in the underlay and overlay network.
+ vSmart controller – This software-based component is responsible for the centralized control plane of the SD-WAN network. It establishes a secure connection to each vEdge router and distributes routes and policy information via the Overlay Management Protocol (OMP), acting as a route reflector. It also orchestrates the secure data plane connectivity between the vEdge routers by distributing crypto key information, allowing for a very scalable, IKE-less architecture.
+ vBond orchestrator – This software-based component performs the initial authentication of vEdge devices and orchestrates vSmart and vEdge connectivity. It also has an important role in enabling the communication of devices that sit behind Network Address Translation (NAT).
+ vEdge router – This device, available as either a hardware appliance or software-based router, sits at a physical site or in the cloud and provides secure data plane connectivity among the sites over one or more WAN transports. It is responsible for traffic forwarding, security, encryption, Quality of Service (QoS), routing protocols such as Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) and Open Shortest Path First (OSPF), and more.

R2(config-router)#neighbor 10.1.1.1 update-source lo0
R2(config-router)#network 10.2.2.0 mask 255.255.255.0

Answer: A

Explanation
With BGP, we must advertise the correct network and subnet mask in the “network” command ( in this case network 10.1.1.0/24 on R1 and network 10.2.2.0/24 on R2). BGP is very strict in the routing advertisements. In other words, BGP only advertises the network which exists exactly in the routing table. In this case, if you put the command “network x.x.0.0 mask 255.255.0.0” or “network x.0.0.0 mask 255.0.0.0” or “network x.x.x.x mask 255.255.255.255” then BGP will not advertise anything.

It is easy to establish eBGP neighborship via the direct link. But let’s see what are required when we want to establish eBGP neighborship via their loopback interfaces. We will need two commands:
+ The command “neighbor 10.1.1.1 ebgp-multihop 2” on R1 and “neighbor 10.2.2.2 ebgp-multihop 2” on R1. This command increases the TTL value to 2 so that BGP updates can reach the BGP neighbor which is two hops away.
+ A route to the neighbor loopback interface. For example: “ip route 10.2.2.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.10.2” on R1 and “ip route 10.1.1.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.10.1” on R2

Question 101
Which statement about a fabric access point is true?
A. It is in local mode and must be connected directly to the fabric edge switch.
B. It is in local mode and must be connected directly to the fabric border node.
C. It is in FlexConnect mode and must be connected directly to the fabric border node.
D. It is in FlexConnect mode and must be connected directly to the fabric edge switch.

Answer: A

Explanation
Fabric mode APs continue to support the same wireless media services that traditional APs support; apply AVC, quality of service (QoS), and other wireless policies; and establish the CAPWAP control plane to the fabric WLC. Fabric APs join as local-mode APs and must be directly connected to the fabric edge node switch to enable fabric registration events, including RLOC assignment via the fabric WLC. The fabric edge nodes use CDP to recognize APs as special wired hosts, applying special port configurations and assigning the APs to a unique overlay network within a common EID space across a fabric. The assignment allows management simplification by using a single subnet to cover the AP infrastructure at a fabric site.

An engineer must block all traffic from a router to its directly connected subnet 209.165.200.0/24. The engineer applies access control list EGRESS in the outbound direction on the GigabitEthernet0/0 interface of the router. However, the router can still ping hosts on the 209.165.200.0/24 subnet.
Which explanation of this behavior is true?
A. Access control lists that are applied outbound to a router interface do not affect traffic that is sourced from the router.
B. After an access control list is applied to an interface, that interface must be shut and no shut for the access control list to take effect.
C. Only standard access control lists can block traffic from a source IP address.
D. The access control list must contain an explicit deny to block traffic from the router.

Link1 is a copper connection and Link2 is a fiber connection. The fiber port must be the primary port for all forwarding. The output of the show spanning-tree command on SW2 shows that the fiber port is blocked by spanning tree. An engineer enters the spanning-tree port-priority 32 command on G0/1 on SW2, but the port remains blocked.
Which command should be entered on the ports that are connected to Link2 to resolve the issue?
A. Enter spanning-tree port-priority 4 on SW2.
B. Enter spanning-tree port-priority 32 on SW1.
C. Enter spanning-tree port-priority 224 on SW1.
D. Enter spanning-tree port-priority 64 on SW2.

Answer: B

Explanation
SW1 needs to block one of its ports to SW2 to avoid a bridging loop between the two switches. Unfortunately, it blocked the fiber port Link2. But how does SW2 select its blocked port? Well, the answer is based on the BPDUs it receives from SW1. answer 'Enter spanning-tree port-priority 32 on SW1' BPDU is superior than another if it has:
1. answer 'Enter spanning-tree port-priority 32 on SW1' lower Root Bridge ID
2. answer 'Enter spanning-tree port-priority 32 on SW1' lower path cost to the Root
3. answer 'Enter spanning-tree port-priority 32 on SW1' lower Sending Bridge ID
4. answer 'Enter spanning-tree port-priority 32 on SW1' lower Sending Port ID
These four parameters are examined in order. In this specific case, all the BPDUs sent by SW1 have the same Root Bridge ID, the same path cost to the Root and the same Sending Bridge ID.
The only parameter left to select the best one is the Sending Port ID (Port ID = port priority +
port index). And the port index of Gi0/0 is lower than the port index of Gi0/1 so Link 1 has been chosen as the primary link.
Therefore we must change the port priority to change the primary link. The lower numerical value of port priority, the higher priority that port has. In other words, we must change the port-priority on Gi0/1 of SW1 (not on Gi0/1 of SW2) to a lower value than that of Gi0/0.

Question 135 
Which feature does Cisco TrustSec use to provide scalable, secure communication throughout a network?
A. security group tag ACL assigned to each port on a switch
B. security group tag number assigned to each user on a switch
C. security group tag number assigned to each port on a network
D. security group tag ACL assigned to each router on a network

Answer: B

Explanation
Cisco TrustSec uses tags to represent logical group privilege. This tag, called a Security Group Tag (SGT), is used in access policies. The SGT is understood and is used to enforce traffic by Cisco switches, routers and firewalls . Cisco TrustSec is defined in three phases: classification, propagation and enforcement.
When users and devices connect to a network, the network assigns a specific security group. This process is called classification. Classification can be based on the results of the authentication or by associating the SGT with an IP, VLAN, or port-profile (-> Answer ‘security group tag ACL assigned to each port on a switch’ and answer ‘security group tag number assigned to each user on a switch’ are not correct as they say “assigned … on a switch” only. Answer ‘security group tag ACL assigned to each router on a network’ is not correct either as it says “assigned to each router”).

Question 548
What mechanism does PIM use to forward multicast traffic?
A. PIM sparse mode uses a pull model to deliver multicast traffic
B. PIM dense mode uses a pull model to deliver multicast traffic
C. PIM sparse mode uses receivers to register with the RP
D. PIM sparse mode uses a flood and prune model to deliver multicast traffic

Answer: A 

Explanation
PIM dense mode (PIM-DM) uses a push model to flood multicast traffic to every corner of the network. This push model is a brute-force method of delivering data to the receivers. This method would be efficient in certain deployments in which there are active receivers on every subnet in the network. PIM-DM initially floods multicast traffic throughout the network. Routers that have no downstream neighbors prune the unwanted traffic. This process repeats every 3 minutes.
PIM Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) uses a pull model to deliver multicast traffic. Only network segments with active receivers that have explicitly requested the data receive the traffic. PIM-SM distributes information about active sources by forwarding data packets on the shared tree. Because PIM-SM uses shared trees (at least initially), it requires the use of an RP. The RP must be administratively configured in the network.
Answer C seems to be correct but it is not, PIM spare mode uses sources (not receivers) to register with the RP. Sources register with the RP, and then data is forwarded down the shared tree to the receivers.

A server running Linux is providing support for virtual machines along with DNS and DHCP services for a small business. Which technology does this represent?
A. container
B. Type 1 hypervisor
C. hardware pass-thru
D. Type 2 hypervisor

Answer: D

Explanation
In contrast to type 1 hypervisor, a type 2 hypervisor (or hosted hypervisor) runs on top of an operating system and not the physical hardware directly. A big advantage of Type 2 hypervisors is that management console software is not required. Examples of type 2 hypervisor are VMware Workstation (which can run on Windows, Mac and Linux) or Microsoft Virtual PC (only runs on Windows)

An engineer is using XML in an application to send information to a RESTCONF enabled device. After sending the request, the engineer gets this response message and a HTTP response code of 400. What do these responses tell the engineer?
A. The Accept header sent was application/xml
B. POST was used instead of PUT to update
C. The Content-Type header sent was application/xml.
D. JSON body was used

Answer: A

Explanation
Accept and Content-type are both headers sent from a client (a browser) to a service. Accept header is a way for a client to specify the media type of the response content it is expecting and Contenttype is a way to specify the media type of request being sent from the client to the server.
The response was sent in XML so we can say the Accept header sent was application/xml.

Question 148. 
Which statement about LISP encapsulation in an EIGRP OTP implementation is true?
A. LISP learns the next hop
B. OTP uses LISP encapsulation to obtain routes from neighbors
C. OTP uses LISP encapsulation for dynamic multipoint tunneling
D. OTP maintains the LISP control plane

Answer: C

Explanation
The EIGRP Over the Top solution can be used to ensure connectivity between disparate EIGRP sites.
This feature uses EIGRP on the control plane and Locator ID Separation Protocol (LISP) encapsulation on the data plane to route traffic across the underlying WAN architecture. EIGRP is used to distribute routes between customer edge (CE) devices within the network, and the traffic forwarded across the WAN architecture is LISP encapsulated.
EIGRP OTP only uses LISP for the data plane, EIGRP is still used for the control plane. Therefore we cannot say OTP uses LISP encapsulation for dynamic multipoint tunneling as this requires encapsulating both data and control plane traffic -> Answer ‘OTP uses LISP encapsulation for dynamic multipoint tunneling’ is not correct.
In OTP, EIGRP serves as the replacement for LISP control plane protocols (therefore EIGRP will learn the next hop, not LISP -> Answer ‘LISP learns the next hop’ is not correct). Instead of doing dynamic EID-to-RLOC mappings in native LISP-mapping services, EIGRP routers running OTP over a service provider cloud create targeted sessions, use the IP addresses provided by the service provider as RLOCs, and exchange routes as EIDs. Let’s take an example:
CCIE/CCNP 350-401 ENCOR Dumps Full Questions with VCE & PDF 56
If R1 and R2 ran OTP to each other, R1 would learn about the network 10.0.2.0/24 from R2 through EIGRP, treat the prefix 10.0.2.0/24 as an EID prefix, and take the advertising next hop 198.51.100.62 as the RLOC for this EID prefix. Similarly, R2 would learn from R1 about the network 10.0.1.0/24 through EIGRP, treat the prefix 10.0.1.0/24 as an EID prefix, and take the advertising next hop 192.0.2.31 as the RLOC for this EID prefix. On both routers, this information would be used to populate the LISP mapping tables. Whenever a packet from 10.0.1.0/24 to 10.0.2.0/24 would arrive at R1, it would use its LISP mapping tables just like in ordinary LISP to discover that the packet has to be LISP encapsulated and tunneled toward 198.51.100.62, and vice versa. The LISP data plane is reused in OTP and does not change; however, the native LISP mapping and resolving mechanisms are replaced by EIGRP.

B. network 20.1.1.2 255.255.0.0. area 0
C. network 20.1.1.2.0.0.255.255 area 0
D. network 20.1.1.2 255.255.255 area 0

Answer: A

Explanation
The network 20.0.0.0 0.0.0.255 area (” command on R2 did not cover the IP address of Fal/1 interface of R2 so OSPF did not run on this interface. Therefore we have to use the command “network 20.1.1.2 0.0.255.255 area 0” to turn on OSPF on this interface.
Note: The command “network 20.1.1.2 0.0.255.255 area 0” can be used too so this answer is also correct but answer C is the best answer here.
The network 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255 area 0 command on R1 will run OSPF on all active interfaces of R1.

Question 150.  
Which two statements about VRF-lite are true? (Choose two)
A. It can support multiple customers on a single switch
B. It supports most routing protocols, including EIGRP, ISIS, and OSPF
C. It should be used when a customer’s router is connected to an ISP over OSPF
D. It can increase the packet switching rate
E. It supports MPLS-VRF label exchange and labeled packets

Answer: AC

Explanation
VRF-lite does not support IGRP and ISIS.
•VRF-lite does not support all MPLS-VRF functionality: label exchange, LDP adjacency, or labeled packets.
•VRF-lite does not affect the packet switching rate.
•The capability vrf-lite subcommand under router ospf should be used when configuring OSPF as the routing protocol between the PE and the CE.

Question 151. 
How are the Cisco Express Forwarding table and the FIB related to each other?
A. Cisco Express Forwarding uses a FIB to make IP destination prefix-based switching decisions correct
B. The FIB is used to populate the Cisco Express Forwarding table
C. There can be only one FIB but multiple Cisco Express Forwarding tables on IOS devices
D. The Cisco Express Forwarding table allows route lookups to be forwarded to the route processor for processing before they are sent to the FIB

Answer: A

Explanation
The Forwarding Information Base (FIB) table – CEF uses a FIB to make IP destination prefix basedswitching decisions. The FIB is conceptually similar to a routing table or information base. It maintains a mirror image of the forwarding information contained in the IP routing table. When routing or topology changes occur in the network, the IP routing table is updated, and these changes are reflected in the FIB. The FIB maintains next-hop address information based on the information in the IP routing table.

Type: Local Session
Source Ports :

Dest Ports: F0/15
Encap: Native
Ingress: Disabled

An engineer configures monitoring on SW1 and enters the show command to verify operation. What does the output confirm?
A. SPAN session 1 monitors activity on VLAN 50 of a remote switch
B. SPAN session 2 only monitors egress traffic exiting port FastEthernet 0/14.
C. SPAN session 2 monitors all traffic entering and exiting port FastEthernet 0/15.
D. RSPAN session 1 is incompletely configured for monitoring

Answer: D

Explanation
SW1 has been configured with the following commands:
SW1(config)#monitor session 1 source remote vlan 50
SW1(config)#monitor session 2 source interface fa0/14
SW1(config)#monitor session 2 destination interface fa0/15
The session 1 on SW1 was configured for Remote SPAN (RSPAN) while session 2 was configured for local SPAN. For RSPAN we need to configure the destination port to complete the configuration.
Note: In fact we cannot create such a session like session 1 because if we only configure Source RSPAN VLAN 50 (with the command monitor session 1 source remote vlan 50) then we will receive a Type: Remote Source Session (not Remote Destination Session).

Question 153. 
Which EIGRP feature allows the use of leak maps?
A. neighbor
B. stub
C. offset-list
D. address-family

Answer: B

Explanation
If we configured an EIGRP stub router so that it only advertises connected and summary routes.
But we also want to have an exception to this rule then we can configure a leak-map. For example:
R4(config-if)#router eigrp 1
R4(config-router)#eigrp stub
R4(config)#ip access-list standard R4_L0opback0
R4(config-std-nacl)#permit host 4.4.4.4
R4(config)#route-map R4_L0opback0_LEAKMAP
R4(config-route-map)#match ip address R4_L0opback0
R4(config)#router eigrp 1
R4(config-router)#eigrp stub leak-map
As we can see the leak-map feature goes long with ‘eigrp stub’ command.

Question 154. 
Which two LISP infrastructure elements are needed to support LISP to non-LISP internetworking? (Choose two)
A. PETR
B. PITR
C. MR
D. MS
E. ALT

Answer: AC

Explanation
In this question we suppose that we only need to send packets from LISP site to non-LISP site successfully. We don‘t care about the way back (if we care about the way back then all PETR, PITR, MS & MR are needed).
Proxy Egress Tunnel Router (PETR): A LISP device that de-encapsulates packets from LISP sites to deliver them to non-LISP sites.

When the xTR in LISP Site 1 want to sends traffic to Non-LISP site, the ITR (not PETR) needs a Map Resolver (MR) to send Map Request to. When the ITR (the xTR in LISP Site 1 in the figure above) receives negative MAP-Reply packet from MR, it caches that prefix and map it to the PETR.

An engineer must create a configuration that executes the show run command and then terminates the session when user CCNP logs in. Which configuration change is required”
A. Add the access-class keyword to the username command
B. Add the access-class keyword to the aaa authentication command
C. Add the autocommand keyword to the username command
D. Add the autocommand keyword to the aaa authentication command

Answer: C

Explanation
The “autocommand” causes the specified command to be issued automatically after the user logs in. When the command is complete, the session is terminated. Because the command can be any length and can contain embedded spaces, commands using the autocommand keyword must be the last option on the line. In this specific question, we have to enter this line “username CCNP autocommand show running config”.

Question 160. 
What is the result of applying this access control list?

ip access-list extended STATEFUL
10 permit tcp any any established
20 deny ip any any

A. TCP traffic with the URG bit set is allowed
B. TCP traffic with the SYN bit set is allowed
C. TCP traffic with the ACK bit set is allowed
D. TCP traffic with the DF bit set is allowed

Answer: C

Explanation
The established keyword is only applicable to TCP access list entries to match TCP segments that have the ACK and/or RST control bit set (regardless of the source and destination ports), which assumes that a TCP connection has already been established in one direction only. Let’s see an example below:

Suppose you only want to allow the hosts inside your company to telnet to an outside server but not vice versa, you can simply use an “established” access-list like this:
access-list 100 permit tcp any any established
access-list 101 permit tcp any any eq telnet
!
interface S0/0
ip access-group 100 in
ip access-group 101 out

Question 161.

Question 164. 
Which two statements about Cisco Express Forwarding load balancing are true? (Choose two)
A. Each hash maps directly to a single entry in the RIB
B. It combines the source IP address subnet mask to create a hash for each destination
C. Cisco Express Forwarding can load-balance over a maximum of two destinations
D. It combines the source and destination IP addresses to create a hash for each destination
E. Each hash maps directly to a single entry in the adjacency table

Answer: DE

Explanation
Cisco IOS software basically supports two modes of CEF load balancing: On per-destination or perpacket basis.
For per destination load balancing a hash is computed out of the source and destination IP address (- > Answer ‘It combines the source and destination IP addresses to create a hash for each destination’ is correct). This hash points to exactly one of the adjacency entries in the adjacency table (-> Answer ‘Each hash maps directly to a single entry in the adjacency table’ is correct), providing that the same path is used for all packets with this source/destination address pair. If per packet load balancing is used the packets are distributed round robin over the available paths. In either case the information in the FIB and adjacency tables provide all the necessary forwarding information, just like for nonload balancing operation.
The number of paths used is limited by the number of entries the routing protocol puts in the routing table, the default in IOS is 4 entries for most IP routing protocols with the exception of BGP, where it is one entry. The maximum number that can be configured is 6 different paths -> Answer ‘Cisco Express Forwarding can load-balance over a maximum of two destinations’ is not correct.

Question 166. 
Which statement about a Cisco APIC controller versus a more traditional SDN controller is true?
A. APIC does support a Southbound REST API
B. APIC supports OpFlex as a Northbound protocol
C. APIC uses a policy agent to translate policies into instructions
D. APIC uses an imperative model

Answer: C

Explanation
The southbound protocol used by APIC is OpFlex that is pushed by Cisco as the protocol for policy enablement across physical and virtual switches.
Southbound interfaces are implemented with some called Service Abstraction Layer (SAL), which talks to the network elements via SNMP and CLI.
Note: Cisco OpFlex is a southbound protocol in a software-defined network (SDN).

Question 167. 
An engineer reviews a router’s logs and discovers the following entry. What is the event’s logging severity level?

Router# *Feb 03 11:13:44 334: %LINK-3-UPDOWN: Interface GigabitEthernet0/1, changed state to up

A. notification
B. error
C. informational
D. warning

Answer: B

Explanation
Number 3 in %LINK-3-UPDOWN is the severity level of this message so in this case it is errors.

Question 168. 
Which characteristic distinguishes Ansible from Chef?
A. Ansible lacs redundancy support for the master server. Chef runs two masters in an active/active mode.
B. Ansible uses Ruby to manage configurations. Chef uses YAML to manage configurations.
C. Ansible pushes the configuration to the client. Chef client pulls the configuration from the server.
D. The Ansible server can run on Linux, Unix or Windows. The Chef server must run on Linux or Unix.

Answer: C

Explanation
Ansible works by connecting to your nodes and pushing out small programs, called “Ansible modules” to them. These programs are written to be resource models of the desired state of the system. Ansible then executes these modules (over SSH by default), and removes them when finished.
Chef is a much older, mature solution to configure management. Unlike Ansible, it does require an installation of an agent on each server, named chef-client. Also, unlike Ansible, it has a Chef server that each client pulls configuration from.

Question 170. 
Which technology is used to provide Layer 2 and Layer 3 logical networks in the Cisco SD Access architecture?
A. underlay network
B. VPN routing/forwarding
C. easy virtual network
D. overlay network

Answer: D

Explanation
An overlay network creates a logical topology used to virtually connect devices that are built over an arbitrary physical underlay topology.
An overlay network is created on top of the underlay network through virtualization (virtual networks). The data plane traffic and control plane signaling are contained within each virtualized network, maintaining isolation among the networks and an independence from the underlay network.
SD-Access allows for the extension of Layer 2 and Layer 3 connectivity across the overlay through the services provided by through LISP.

Which two commands ensure that DSW1 becomes root bridge for VLAN 10 and 20?
A. spanning-tree mst 1 priority 1
B. spanning-tree mst 1 root primary
C. spanning-tree mstp vlan 10,20 root primary
D. spanning-tree mst vlan 10,20 priority root
E. spanning-tree mst 1 priority 4096

Answer: BE

Explanation
Priority values are 0, 4096, 8192, 12288, 16384, 20480, 24576, 28672, 32768, 36864, 40960, 45056, 49152, 53248, 57344, and 61440. All other values are rejected.
From the second command output (show spanning-tree mst) we learn that MST1 includes VLANs 10 & 20.Therefore if we want DSW1 to become root bridge for these VLANs we need to set the MST 1 region to root ->The command “spanning-tree mst 1 root primary” can do the trick. In fact, this command runs a macro and setsthe priority lower than the current root.
Also we can see the current root bridge for these VLANs has the priority of 32769 (default value + sysid) so wecan set the priority of DSW1 to a specific lower value. But notice that the priority must be a multiple of 4096.

Question 186. 
During deployment, a network engineer notices that voice traffic is not being tagged correctly as it traverses the network. Which COS to DSCP map must be modified to ensure that voice traffic is treated properly?
A. COS of 5 to DSCP 46
B. COS of 7 to DSCP 48
C. COS of 6 to DSCP 46
D. COS of 3 to DSCP of 26

Answer: A

Explanation
CoS value 5 is commonly used for VOIP and CoS value 5 should be mapped to DSCP 46. DSCP 46 is defined as being for EF (Expedited Forwarding) traffic flows and is the value usually assigned to all interactive voice and video traffic. This is to keep the uniformity from end-to-end that DSCP EF (mostly for VOICE RTP) is mapped to COS 5.
Note:
+ CoS is a L2 marking contained within an 802.1q tag,. The values for CoS are 0 – 7
+ DSCP is a L3 marking and has values 0 – 63
+ The default DSCP-to-CoS mapping for CoS 5 is DSCP 40

Question 187. 
Which two statements about IP SLA are true? (Choose two)
A. It uses NetFlow for passive traffic monitoring
B. It can measure MOS
C. The IP SLA responder is a component in the source Cisco device
D. It is Layer 2 transport-independent
E. It uses active traffic monitoring
F. SNMP access is not supported

Answer: DE

Explanation
IP SLAs allows Cisco customers to analyze IP service levels for IP applications and services, to increase productivity, to lower operational costs, and to reduce the frequency of network outages. IP SLAs uses active traffic monitoring-the generation of traffic in a continuous, reliable, and predictable manner-for measuring network performance.
Being Layer-2 transport independent, IP SLAs can be configured end-to-end over disparate networks to best reflect the metrics that an end-user is likely to experience.

B. R3 is missing a return route to 10.99.69.0/30
C. R2 and R3 do not have an OSPF adjacency
D. The DF bit has been set

Answer: D

Explanation
If the DF bit is set, routers cannot fragment packets. From the output below, we learn that the maximum MTU of R2 is 1492 bytes while we sent ping with 1500 bytes. Therefore these ICMP packets were dropped.
Note: Record option displays the address(es) of the hops (up to nine) the packet goes through.

Question 191. 
An engineer must configure interface GigabitEthernet0/0 for VRRP group 10. When the router has the highest priority in the group, it must assume the master role. Which command set must be added to the initial configuration to accomplish this task?

Initial config
Int g0/0
Description to IDF
IP address 172.16.13.2 255.255.255.0

A. vrrp 10 ip 172.16.13.254
vrrp 10 preempt
B. standby 10 ip 172.16.13.254
standby 10 priority 120
C. vrrp group 10 ip 172.16.13 254.255.255.255.0
vrrp group 10 priority 120
D. standby 10 ip 172.16.13.254 255.255.255.0
standby 10 preempt

Answer: A

Explanation
In fact, VRRP has the preemption enabled by default so we don‘t need the vrrp 10 preempt command. The default priority is 100 so we don‘t need to configure it either. But notice that the correct command to configure the virtual IP address for the group is vrrp 10 ip {ipaddress} (not vrrp group 10 ip …) and this command does not include a subnet mask.

Question 192. 
What is a Type 1 hypervisor?
A. runs directly on a physical server and depends on a previously installed operating system
B. runs directly on a physical server and includes its own operating system
C. runs on a virtual server and depends on an already installed operating system
D. run on a virtual server and includes its own operating system

Answer: B

Explanation
There are two types of hypervisors: type 1 and type 2 hypervisor.
In type 1 hypervisor (or native hypervisor), the hypervisor is installed directly on the physical server. Then instances of an operating system (OS) are installed on the hypervisor. Type 1 hypervisor has direct access to the hardware resources. Therefore they are more efficient than hosted architectures. Some examples of type 1 hypervisor are VMware vSphere/ESXi, Oracle VM Server, KVM and Microsoft Hyper-V.
In contrast to type 1 hypervisor, a type 2 hypervisor (or hosted hypervisor) runs on top of an operating system and not the physical hardware directly. A big advantage of Type 2 hypervisors is that management console software is not required. Examples of type 2 hypervisor are VMware Workstation (which can run on Windows, Mac and Linux) or Microsoft Virtual PC (only runs on Windows).

Question 195. 
Refer to Exhibit. 

         GRE
   =================
RTA - - - RTB - - - RTC
   MTU 1500   MTU1500

MTU has been configured on the underlying physical topology, and no MTU command has been configured on the tunnel interfaces. What happens when a 1500-byte IPv4 packet traverses the GRE tunnel from host X to host Y, assuming the DF bit is cleared?


A. The packet arrives on router C without fragmentation.
B. The packet is discarded on router A
C. The packet is discarded on router B
D. The packet arrives on router C fragmented.

Answer: D

Explanation
Like any protocol, using GRE adds a few bytes to the size of data packets. This must be factored into the MSS and MTU settings for packets. If the MTU is 1,500 bytes and the MSS is 1,460 bytes (to account for the size of the necessary IP and TCP headers), the addition of GRE 24-byte headers will cause the packets to exceed the MTU:
1,460 bytes [payload] + 20 bytes [TCP header]+ 20 bytes [IP header] + 24 bytes [GRE header + IP header] = 1,524 bytes
As a result, the packets will be fragmented. Fragmentation slows down packet delivery times and increases how much compute power is used, because packets that exceed the MTU must be broken down and then reassembled.

Question 196. 
Into which two pieces of information does the LISP protocol split the device identity? (Choose two)
A. Device ID
B. Enterprise Identifier
C. LISP ID
D. Routing Locator

Question 200. 
A GRE tunnel is down with the error message %TUN-5-RECUR DOWN:

Tunnel0 temporarily disabled due to recursive routing error.
Which two options describe possible causes of the error? (Choose two)

A. There is link flapping on the tunnel
B. Incorrect destination IP addresses are configured on the tunnel
C. The tunnel mode and tunnel IP address are misconfigured
D. There is instability in the network due to route flapping
E. The tunnel destination is being routed out of the tunnel interface

Answer: DE

Explanation
The %TUN-5-RECURDOWN: Tunnel0 temporarily disabled due to recursive routing error message means that the generic routing encapsulation (GRE) tunnel router has discovered a recursive routing problem. This condition is usually due to one of these causes:
+ A misconfiguration that causes the router to try to route to the tunnel destination address using the tunnel interface itself (recursive routing)
+ A temporary instability caused by route flapping elsewhere in the network

You have just created a new VRF on PE3. You have enabled debug ip bgp vpnv4 unicast updates on PE1, and you can see the route in the debug, but not in the BGP VPNv4 table. Which two statements are true? (Choose two)
A. After you configure route-target import 999:999 for a VRF on PE1, the route will be accepted
B. VPNv4 is not configured between PE1 and PE3
C. address-family ipv4 vrf is not configured on PE3
D. PE1 will reject the route due to automatic route filtering
E. After you configure route-target import 999:999 for a VRF on PE3, the route will be accepted

Answer: AD

Explanation
Because some PE routers might receive routing information they do not require, a basic requirement is to be able to filter the MP-iBGP updates at the ingress to the PE router so that the router does not need to keep this information in memory.
The Automatic Route Filtering feature fulfills this filtering requirement. This feature is available by default on all PE routers, and no additional configuration is necessary to enable it. Its function is to filter automatically VPN-IPv4 routes that contain a route target extended community that does not match any of the PE’s configured VRFs. This effectively discards any unwanted VPN-IPv4 routes silently, thus reducing the amount of information that the PE has to store in memory -> Answer ‘PE1 will reject the route due to automatic route filtering’ is correct.

Question 208. 
Which two statements about EIGRP load balancing are true? (Choose two)
A. Cisco Express Forwarding is required to load-balance across interfaces
B. A path can be used for load balancing only if it is a feasible successor
C. EIGRP supports unequal-cost paths by default
D. Any path in the EIGRP topology table can be used for unequal-cost load balancing
E. EIGRP supports 6 unequal-cost paths

Answer: BE

Explanation
EIGRP provides a mechanism to load balance over unequal cost paths (or called unequal cost load balancing) through the “variance” command. In other words, EIGRP will install all paths with metric < variance * best metric into the local routing table, provided that it meets the feasibility condition to prevent routing loop. The path that meets this requirement is called a feasible successor. If a path is not a feasible successor, it is not used in load balancing.
Note: The feasibility condition states that, the Advertised Distance (AD) of a route must be lower than the feasible distance of the current successor route.

Question 209. 
What is the difference between CEF and process switching?
A. CEF processes packets that are too complex for process switching to manage.
B. CEF is more CPU-intensive than process switching.
C. CEF uses the FIB and the adjacency table to make forwarding decisions, whereas process switching punts each packet.
D. Process switching is faster than CEF.

Answer: C

Explanation
“Punt” is often used to describe the action of moving a packet from the fast path (CEF) to the route processor for handling.
Cisco Express Forwarding (CEF) provides the ability to switch packets through a device in a very quick and efficient way while also keeping the load on the router‘s processor low. CEF is made up of two different main components: the Forwarding Information Base (FIB) and the Adjacency Table.
Process switching is the slowest switching methods (compared to fast switching and Cisco Express Forwarding) because it must find a destination in the routing table. Process switching must also construct a new Layer 2 frame header for every packet. With process switching, when a packet comes in, the scheduler calls a process that examines the routing table, determines which interface the packet should be switched to and then switches the packet. The problem is, this happens for the every packet.

Question 210. 
Which QoS mechanism will prevent a decrease in TCP performance?
A. Shaper
B. Rate-Limit
C. Policer
D. Fair-Queue
E. WRED
F. LLQ

Answer: E

Explanation
Weighted Random Early Detection (WRED) is just a congestion avoidance mechanism. WRED drops packets selectively based on IP precedence. Edge routers assign IP precedences to packets as they enter the network. When a packet arrives, the following events occur:
The average queue size is calculated.
2. If the average is less than the minimum queue threshold, the arriving packet is queued.
3. If the average is between the minimum queue threshold for that type of traffic and the maximum threshold for the interface, the packet is either dropped or queued, depending on the packet drop probability for that type of traffic.
4. If the average queue size is greater than the maximum threshold, the packet is dropped.
WRED reduces the chances of tail drop (when the queue is full, the packet is dropped) by selectively dropping packets when the output interface begins to show signs of congestion (thus it can mitigate congestion by preventing the queue from filling up). By dropping some packets early rather than waiting until the queue is full, WRED avoids dropping large numbers of packets at once and minimizes the chances of global synchronization. Thus, WRED allows the transmission line to be used fully at all times.
WRED generally drops packets selectively based on IP precedence. Packets with a higher IP precedence are less likely to be dropped than packets with a lower precedence. Thus, the higher the priority of a packet, the higher the probability that the packet will be delivered.

Question 211. 
Which IPv6 migration method relies on dynamic tunnels that use the 2002::/16 reserved address space?
A. GRE
B. 6RD
C. 6to4
D. ISATAP

Answer: C

Explanation
6to4 tunnel is a technique which relies on reserved address space 2002::/16 (you must remember this range). These tunnels determine the appropriate destination address by combining the IPv6 prefix with the globally unique destination 6to4 border router’s IPv4 address, beginning with the 2002::/16 prefix, in this format:
2002:border-router-IPv4-address::/48
For example, if the border-router-IPv4-address is 64.101.64.1, the tunnel interface will have an IPv6 prefix of 2002:4065:4001:1::/64, where 4065:4001 is the hexadecimal equivalent of 64.101.64.1. This technique allows IPv6 sites to communicate with each other over the IPv4 network without explicit tunnel setup but we have to implement it on all routers on the path.

Question 212. 
What are three valid HSRP states? (Choose three)
A. INIT
B. listen
C. full
D. learning
E. speak
F. established

Answer: ABE

Explanation
HSRP StatesWhen in operation, HSRP devices are configured into one of many states:
Active – This is the state of the device that is actively forwarding traffic.
Init or Disabled – This is the state of a device that is not yet ready or able to participate in HSRP.
Learn – This is the state of a device that has not yet determined the virtual IP address and has not yet seen a hello message from an active device.
Listen – This is the state of a device that is receiving hello messages.
Speak – This is the state of a device that is sending and receiving hello messages.
Standby – This is the state of a device that is prepared to take over the traffic forwarding duties from the active device.

Question 215. 
How does SSO work with HSRP to minimize network disruptions?
A. It enables HSRP to elect another switch in the group as the active HSRP switch.
B. It ensures fast failover in the case of link failure.
C. It enables data forwarding along known routes following a switchover, white the routing protocol reconverges.
D. It enables HSRP to failover to the standby RP on the same device.

Answer: D

Explanation
SSO HSRP alters the behavior of HSRP when a device with redundant Route Processors (RPs) is configured for stateful switchover (SSO) redundancy mode. When an RP is active and the other RP is standby, SSO enables the standby RP to take over if the active RP fails.
The SSO HSRP feature enables the Cisco IOS HSRP subsystem software to detect that a standby RP is installed and the system is configured in SSO redundancy mode. Further, if the active RP fails, no change occurs to the HSRP group itself and traffic continues to be forwarded through the current active gateway device.

C. access-list 10 permit tcp any any eq 21 established
D. access-list 110 permit tcp any any eq 21 established

Answer: D

Explanation
The established keyword is only applicable to TCP access list entries to match TCP segments that have the ACK and/or RST control bit set (regardless of the source and destination ports), which assumes that a TCP connection has already been established in one direction only. 

Suppose you only want to allow the hosts inside your company to telnet to an outside server but not vice versa, you can simply use an ― ”established” access-list like this:
access-list 100 permit tcp any any established
access-list 101 permit tcp any any eq telnet
!
interface S0/0
ip access-group 100 in
ip access-group 101 out
Note: Suppose host A wants to start communicating with host B using TCP. Before they can send real data, a three-way handshake must be established first. 

1. First host A will send a SYN message (a TCP segment with SYN flag set to 1, SYN is short for SYNchronize) to indicate it wants to setup a connection with hostB. This message includes a sequence (SEQ) number for tracking purpose. This sequence number can be any 32-bit number (range from 0 to 232) so we use ―”x” to represent it.
2. After receiving SYN message from host A, host B replies with SYN-ACK message (some books may call it ―SYN/ACK‖ or ―SYN, ACK‖ message. ACK is short for ACKnowledge). This message includes a SYN sequence number and an ACK number:
+ SYN sequence number (let‘s called it “y”) is a random number and does not have any relationship with Host A‘s SYN SEQ number.
+ ACK number is the next number of Host A‘s SYN sequence number it received, so we represent it with “x+1″. It means ―I received your part. Now send me the next part (x + 1)”.
The SYN-ACK message indicates host B accepts to talk to host A (via ACK part). And ask if host A still wants to talk to it as well (via SYN part).
3. After Host A received the SYN-ACK message from host B, it sends an ACK message with ACK number “y+1” to hostB. This confirms host A still wants to talk to hostB.

Question 226. 
In a Cisco SD-Access fabric, which control plane protocol is used for mapping and resolving endpoints?
A. DHCP
B. VXLAN
C. SXP
D. LISP

Answer: D

Explanation
We see in the traceroute result the packet could reach 10.99.69.5 (on R2) but it could not go any further so we can deduce an ACL on R3 was blocking it.
Note: Record option displays the address(es) of the hops (up to nine) the packet goes through.

Question 227. 
Refer to the exhibit. 

  F0/0        F0/0 F0/1          F0/1
R1 - - - - - - - R2 - - - - - - - - R3
  .1           .2  .5             .6
    10.99.69.0/30    10.99.69.4/30

(Traceroute stops at 10.99.69.5

The traceroute fails from R1 to R3. What is the cause of the failure?
A. The loopback on R3 Is in a shutdown stale.
B. An ACL applied Inbound on loopback0 of R2 Is dropping the traffic.
C. An ACL applied Inbound on fa0/1 of R3 is dropping the traffic.
D. Redistribution of connected routes into OSPF is not configured.

Answer: C

Question 228. 
In an SD-WAN deployment, which action is the vSmart controller responsible for?
A. handle, maintain, and gather configuration and status for nodes within the SD-WAN fabric
B. onboard vEdge nodes into the SD-WAN fabric
C. gather telemetry data from yEdge routers
D. distribute policies that govern data forwarding performed within the SD-WAN fabric

Answer: D

Explanation
Control plane (vSmart) builds and maintains the network topology and make decisions on the traffic flows. The vSmart controller disseminates control plane information between WAN Edge devices, implements control plane policies and distributes data plane policies to network devices for enforcement.

+ Orchestration plane (vBond) assists in securely onboarding the SD-WAN WAN Edge routers into the SD-WAN overlay (-> Therefore answer “onboard vEdge nodes into the SD-WAN fabric” mentioned about vBond). The vBond controller, or orchestrator, authenticates and authorizes the SD-WAN components onto the network. The vBond orchestrator takes an added responsibility to distribute the list of vSmart and vManage controller information to the WAN Edge routers. vBond is the only device in SD-WAN that requires a public IP address as it is the first point of contact and authentication for all SD-WAN components to join the SD-WAN fabric. All other components need to know the vBond IP or DNS information.
+ Management plane (vManage) is responsible for central configuration and monitoring. The vManage controller is the centralized network management system that provides a single pane of glass GUI interface to easily deploy, configure, monitor and troubleshoot all Cisco SD-WAN components in the network. (-> Answer “manage, maintain, and gather configuration and status for nodes within the SD-WAN fabric” and answer “gather telemetry data from vEdge routers” are about vManage)
+ Control plane (vSmart) builds and maintains the network topology and make decisions on the traffic flows. The vSmart controller disseminates control plane information between WAN Edge devices, implements control plane policies and distributes data plane policies to network devices for enforcement (-> Answer “distribute security information for tunnel establishment between vEdge routers” is about vSmart)

Question 229. 
Which deployment option of Cisco NGFW provides scalability?
A. tap
B. inline tap
C. high availability
D. clustering

Answer: D

Explanation
Clustering lets you group multiple Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) units together as a single logical device. Clustering is only supported for the FTD device on the Firepower 9300 and the Firepower 4100 series. A cluster provides all the convenience of a single device (management, integration into a network) while achieving the increased throughput and redundancy of multiple devices.

Question 230. 
What is the function of the fabric control plane node In a Cisco SD-Access deployment?
A. It is responsible for policy application and network segmentation in the fabric.
B. It performs traffic encapsulation and security profiles enforcement in the fabric.
C. It holds a comprehensive database that tracks endpoints and networks in the fabric.
D. It provides Integration with legacy nonfabric-enabled environments.

Answer: C

Explanation
Fabric control plane node (C): One or more network elements that implement the LISP Map-Server (MS) and Map-Resolver (MR) functionality. The control plane node’s host tracking database keep track of all endpoints in a fabric site and associates the endpoints to fabric nodes in what is known as an EID-to-RLOC binding in LISP.

Question 231. 
What are two considerations when using SSO as a network redundancy feature? (Choose two)
A. both supervisors must be configured separately
B. the multicast state is preserved during switchover
C. must be combined with NSF to support uninterrupted Layer 2 operations
D. must be combined with NSF to support uninterrupted Layer 3 operations
E. requires synchronization between supervisors in order to guarantee continuous connectivity

Answer: DE

Explanation
against failure due to the Supervisor or loss of service because of software problems. The access layer typically provides Layer 2 services with redundant switches making up the distribution layer. The Layer 2 access layer can benefit from SSO deployed without NSF. Some Enterprises have deployed Layer 3 routing at the access layer. In that case, NSF/SSO can be used.
Cisco IOS Nonstop Forwarding(NSF) always runs with stateful switchover (SSO) and provides redundancy for Layer 3 traffic.

Question 233. 
Using the EIRP formula, what parameter is subtracted to determine the EIRP value?
A. transmitter power
B. antenna cable loss
C. antenna gain
D. signal-to-noise ratio

Answer: B

Explanation
Once you know the complete combination of transmitter power level, the length of cable, and the antenna gain, you can figure out the actual power level that will be radiated from the antenna. This is known as the effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP), measured in dBm.
EIRP is a very important parameter because it is regulated by governmental agencies in most countries. In those cases, a system cannot radiate signals higher than a maximum allowable EIRP. To find the EIRP of a system, simply add the transmitter power level to the antenna gain and subtract the cable loss.

Question 234. 
What is the responsibility of a secondary WLC?
A. It shares the traffic load of the LAPs with the primary controller.
B. It avoids congestion on the primary controller by sharing the registration load on the LAPs.
C. It registers the LAPs if the primary controller fails.
D. It enables Layer 2 and Layer 3 roaming between Itself and the primary controller.

Answer: C

Explanation
When the primary controller (WLC-1) goes down, the APs automatically get registered with the secondary controller (WLC-2). The APs register back to the primary controller when the primary controller comes back on line.

Question 235. 
Which two sources cause interference for Wi-Fi networks? (Choose two).
A. mirrored wall
B. 900MHz baby monitor
C. fish tank
D. DECT 6.0 cordless
E. Incandesent lights

Answer: AC

Explanation
Windows can actually block your WiFi signal. How? Because the signals will be reflected by the glass.
Some new windows have transparent films that can block certain wave types, and this can make it harder for your WiFi signal to pass through.
Tinted glass is another problem for the same reasons. They sometimes contain metallic films that can completely block out your signal. Mirrors, like windows, can reflect your signal. They’re also a source of electromagnetic interference because of their metal backings.
Reference: https://dis-dot-dat.net/what-materials-can-block-a-wifi-signal/ An incandescent light bulb, incandescent lamp or incandescent light globe is an electric light with a wire filament heated until it glows. WiFi operates in the gigahertz microwave band. The FCC has strict regulations on RFI (radio frequency interference) from all sorts of things, including light bulbs -> Incandesent lights do not interfere Wi-Fi networks.
Note:
+ Many baby monitors operate at 900MHz and won’t interfere with Wi-Fi, which uses the 2.4GHz band. + DECT cordless phone 6.0 is designed to eliminate wifi interference by operating on a different
frequency.
There is essentially no such thing as DECT wifi interference.

Question 236. 
How does the EIGRP metric differ from the OSPF metric?
A. The EIGRP metric is calculated based on bandwidth only. The OSPF metric is calculated on delay only.
B. The EIGRP metric is calculated based on delay only. The OSPF metric is calculated on bandwidth and delay.
C. The EIGRP metric Is calculated based on bandwidth and delay. The OSPF metric is calculated on bandwidth only.
D. The EIGRP metric Is calculated based on hop count and bandwidth. The OSPF metric is calculated on bandwidth and delay.

Answer: C

Explanation
By default, EIGRP metric is calculated:
metric = bandwidth + delay
While OSPF is calculated by:
OSPF metric = Reference bandwidth / Interface bandwidth in bps
(Or Cisco uses 100Mbps (108) bandwidth as reference bandwidth. With this bandwidth, our equation would be:
Cost = 108/interface bandwidth in bps)

Question 237.  
What are two differences between the RIB and the FIB? (Choose two.)
A. The FIB is derived from the data plane, and the RIB is derived from the FIB.
B. The RIB is a database of routing prefixes, and the FIB is the Information used to choose the egress interface for each packet.
C. FIB is a database of routing prefixes, and the RIB is the information used to choose the egress interface for each packet.
D. The FIB is derived from the control plane, and the RIB is derived from the FIB.
E. The RIB is derived from the control plane, and the FIB is derived from the RIB.

Answer: BE

Explanation
The Forwarding Information Base (FIB) contains destination reachability information as well as next hop information. This information is then used by the router to make forwarding decisions. The FIB allows for very efficient and easy lookups. 

The FIB maintains next-hop address information based on the information in the IP routing table (RIB).
Note: In order to view the Routing information base (RIB) table, use the show ip route command. To view the Forwarding Information Base (FIB), use the show ip cef command. RIB is in Control plane while FIB is in Data plane.

Question 238.  
What is the purpose of the LISP routing and addressing architecture?
A. It creates two entries for each network node, one for Its identity and another for its location on the network.
B. It allows LISP to be applied as a network visualization overlay though encapsulation.
C. It allows multiple Instances of a routing table to co-exist within the same router.
D. It creates head-end replication used to deliver broadcast and multicast frames to the entire network.

Answer: A

Explanation
Locator ID Separation Protocol (LISP) solves this issue by separating the location and identity of a device through the Routing locator (RLOC) and Endpoint identifier (EID):
+ Endpoint identifiers (EIDs) – assigned to end hosts.
+ Routing locators (RLOCs) – assigned to devices (primarily routers) that make up the global routing system.

  \       /
   \     /
   AP1  AP2

Both controllers are in the same mobility group. Which result occurs when client 1 roams between APs that are registered to different controllers in the same WLAN?
A. Client 1 contact controller B by using an EoIP tunnel.
B. CAPWAP tunnel is created between controller A and controllerB.
C. Client 1 users an EoIP tunnel to contact controllerA.
D. The client database entry moves from controller A to controllerB.

Answer: D

Explanation
This is called Inter Controller-L2 Roaming. Inter-Controller (normally layer 2) roaming occurs when a client roam between two APs registered to two different controllers, where each controller has an interface in the client subnet. In this instance, controllers exchange mobility control messages (over UDP port 16666) and the client database entry is moved from the original controller to the new controller.

Question 241.  
Which element enables communication between guest VMs within a virtualized environment?
A. hypervisor
B. vSwitch
C. virtual router
D. pNIC

Answer: B

Explanation
Each VM is provided with a virtual NIC (vNIC) that is connected to the virtual switch. Multiple vNICs can connect to a single vSwitch, allowing VMs on a physical host to communicate with one another at layer 2 without having to go out to a physical switch.

These commands have been added to the configuration of a switch. Which command flags an error If It is added to this configuration?
A. monitor session 1 source interface port-channel 6
B. monitor session 1 source vlan 10
C. monitor session 1 source interface FastEthernet0/1 rx
D. monitor session 1 source interface port-channel 7, port-channel 8

Answer: B

Explanation
A monitor session can source from interfaces or VLANs – not both at the same time.
RSPAN consists of at least one RSPAN source session, an RSPAN VLAN, and at least one RSPAN destination session. You separately configure RSPAN source sessions and RSPAN destination sessions on different network devices. To configure an RSPAN source session on a device, you associate a set of source ports or source VLANs with an RSPAN VLAN.
Traffic monitoring in a SPAN session has these restrictions:
+ Sources can be ports or VLANs, but you cannot mix source ports and source VLANs in the same session.
Reference: Here
Therefore in this question, we cannot configure a source VLAN because we configured source ports for RSPAN session 1 already.

Question 245. 
Which entity is responsible for maintaining Layer 2 isolation between segments In a VXLAN environment?
A. switch fabric
B. VTEP
C. VNID
D. host switch

Answer: C

Explanation
VXLAN uses an 8-byte VXLAN header that consists of a 24-bit VNID and a few reserved bits. The VXLAN header together with the original Ethernet frame goes in the UDP payload.
The 24-bit VNID is used to identify Layer 2 segments and to maintain Layer 2 isolation between the segments.

The key fields for the VXLAN packet in each of the protocol headers are:
+ Outer MAC header (14 bytes with 4 bytes optional) – Contains the MAC address of the source VTEP and the MAC address of the next-hop router. Each router along the packet‘s path rewrites this header so that the source address is the router‘s MAC address and the destination address is the next-hop router‘s MAC address.
+ Outer IP header (20 bytes)- Contains the IP addresses of the source and destination VTEPs.
+ (Outer) UDP header (8 bytes)- Contains source and destination UDP ports:
– Source UDP port: The VXLAN protocol repurposes this standard field in a UDP packet header. Instead of using this field for the source UDP port, the protocol uses it as a numeric identifier for the particular flow between VTEPs. The VXLAN standard does not define how this number is derived, but the source VTEP usually calculates it from a hash of some combination of fields from the inner Layer 2 packet and the Layer 3 or Layer 4 headers of the original frame.
– Destination UDP port: The VXLAN UDP port. The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) allocates port 4789 to VXLAN.
+ VXLAN header (8 bytes)- Contains the 24-bit VNI (or VNID)
+ Original Ethernet/L2 Frame – Contains the original Layer 2 Ethernet frame.

Question 247. 
When reason could cause an OSPF neighborship to be in the EXSTART/EXCHANGE state?
A. Mismatched OSPF network type
B. Mismatched areas
C. Mismatched MTU size
D. Mismatched OSPF link costs

Answer: C

Explanation
When OSPF adjacency is formed, a router goes through several state changes before it becomes fully adjacent with its neighbor. The states are Down -> Attempt (optional) -> Init -> 2-Way -> Exstart -> Exchange -> Loading -> Full. Short descriptions about these states are listed below:
Down: no information (hellos) has been received from this neighbor.
Attempt: only valid for manually configured neighbors in an NBMA environment. In Attempt state, the router sends unicast hello packets every poll interval to the neighbor, from which hellos have not been received within the dead interval.
Init: specifies that the router has received a hello packet from its neighbor, but the receiving router’s ID was not included in the hello packet
2-Way: indicates bi-directional communication has been established between two routers.
Exstart: Once the DR and BDR are elected, the actual process of exchanging link state information can start between the routers and their DR and BDR.
Exchange: OSPF routers exchange database descriptor (DBD) packets
Loading: In this state, the actual exchange of link state information occurs Full: routers are fully adjacent with each other (Reference:
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk365/technologies_tech_note09186a0080093f0e.shtml)
Neighbors Stuck in Exstart/Exchange State the problem occurs most frequently when attempting to run OSPF between a Cisco router and another vendor’s router. The problem occurs when the maximum transmission unit (MTU) settings for neighboring router interfaces don’t match. If the router with the higher MTU sends a packet larger that the MTU set on the neighboring router, the neighboring router ignores the packet.

Question 256. 
Which control plane protocol is used between Cisco SD-WAN routers and vSmart controllers?
A. BGP
B. OMP
C. TCP
D. UDP

Answer: B

Explanation
Cisco SD-WAN uses Overlay Management Protocol (OMP) which manages the overlay network. OMP runs between the vSmart controllers and WAN Edge routers (and among vSmarts themselves) where control plane information, such as the routing, policy, and management information, is exchanged over a secure connection.

Question 257. 
In a Cisco Catalyst switch equipped with two supervisor modules an administrator must temporally remove the active supervisor from the chassis to perform hardware maintenance on it. Which mechanism ensure that the active supervisor removal is not disruptive to the network operation?
A. NSF/NSR
B. SSO
C. HSRP
D. VRRP

Answer: B

Explanation
Stateful Switchover (SSO) provides protection for network edge devices with dual Route Processors (RPs) that represent a single point of failure in the network design, and where an outage might result in loss of service for customers.

Question 258. 
Which router is elected the IGMP Querier when more than one router is in the same LAN segment?
A. The router with the shortest uptime
B. The router with the lowest IP address
C. The router with the highest IP address
D. The router with the longest uptime

Answer: B

Explanation
Query messages are used to elect the IGMP querier as follows:
1. When IGMPv2 devices start, they each multicast a general query message to the allsystems grou address of 224.0.0.1 with their interface address in the source IP address field of the message.
2. When an IGMPv2 device receives a general query message, the device compares the source IP address in the message with its own interface address. The device with the lowest IP address on the subnet is elected the IGMP querier.
3. All devices (excluding the querier) start the query timer, which is reset whenever a general query message is received from the IGMP querier. If the query timer expires, it is assumed that the IGMP querier has gone down, and the election process is performed again to elect a new IGMP querier.

Question 259. 
Refer to the exhibit.

ip sla 10
icmp-echo 192.168.10.20
timeout 500
frequency 3
ip sla schedule 10 life forever start-time now
track 10 ip sla 10 reachability

The IP SLA is configured in a router. An engineer must configure an EEM applet to shut down the interface and bring it back up when there is a problem with the IP SLA. Which configuration should the engineer use?

A. event manager applet EEM_IP_SLA
event track 10 state down

B. event manager applet EEM_IP_SLA
event track 10 state unreachable

C. event manager applet EEM_IP_SLA
event sla 10 state unreachable

D. event manager applet EEM_IP_SLA
event sla 10 state down

Answer: A

Explanation
The ip sla 10 will ping the IP 192.168.10.20 every 3 seconds to make sure the connection is still up. We can configure an EEM applet if there is any problem with this IP SLA via the command event track 10 state down.

A. Option A
B. Option B
C. Option C
D. Option D

Answer: A

Explanation
R3 advertises BGP updates to R1 with multiple AS 100 so R3 believes the path to reach AS 200 via R3 is farther than R2 so R3 will choose R2 to forward traffic to AS 200.

Question 262. s
Refer to the exhibit. 

(Too much to write)

DSW1 -  DSW2 (primary)

Assuming all links are functional, which path does PC1 take to reach DSW1?
A. PC1 goes from ALSW1 to DSW1
B. PC1 goes form ALSW1 to DSW2 to ALSW2 to DSW1
C. PC1 goes from ALSW1 to DSW2 to Core to DSW1
D. PC1 goes from ALSW1 to DSW2 to DSW1

Answer: D

Explanation
In the topology above, we see DSW2 has lowest priority 24576 so it is the root bridge for VLAN 10 so surely all traffic for this VLAN must go through it. All of DSW2 ports must be in forwarding state. And:
+ The direct link between DSW1 and ALSW1 is blocked by STP.
+ The direct link between DSW1 and ALSW2 is also blocked by STP.
Therefore PC1 must go via this path: PC1 -> ALSW1 -> DSW2 -> DSW1.

Question 263. 
A customer has deployed an environment with shared storage to allow for the migration of virtual machines between servers with dedicated operating systems that provide the virtualization platform. What is this operating system described as?
A. hosted virtualization
B. type 1 hypervisor
C. container oriented
D. decoupled

Answer: A

Explanation
Hosted virtualization is type 2 hypervisor. In contrast to type 1 hypervisor, a type 2 hypervisor (or hosted hypervisor) runs on top of an operating system and not the physical hardware directly. A big advantage of Type 2 hypervisors is that management console software is not required. Examples of type 2 hypervisor are VMware Workstation (which can run on Windows, Mac and Linux) or Microsoft Virtual PC (only runs on Windows).

Question 267. 
An engineer has deployed a single Cisco 5520 WLC with a management IP address of 172.16.50.5/24. The engineer must register 50 new Cisco AIR-CAP2802I-E-K9 access points to the WLC using DHCP option 43. The access points are connected to a switch in VLAN 100 that uses the 172.16.100.0/24 subnet. The engineer has configured the DHCP scope on the switch as follows:

Network 172.16.100.0 255.255.255.0
Default router 172.16.100.1
Option 43 ascii 172.16.50.5

The access points are failing to join the wireless LAN controller. Which action resolves the issue?
A. configure option 43 Hex F104.AC10.3205
B. configure option 43 Hex F104.CA10.3205
C. configure dns-server 172.16.50.5
D. configure dns-server 172.16.100.1

Answer: A

Explanation
172.16.50.5 in hex is We will have the answer from this paragraph: “TLV values for the Option 43 suboption: Type + Length + Value. Type is always the suboption code 0xf1. Length is the number of controller management IP addresses times 4 in hex. Value is the IP address of the controller listed sequentially in hex. For example, suppose there are two controllers with management interface IP addresses, 192.168.10.5 and 192.168.10.20. The type is 0xf1. The length is 2 * 4 = 8 = 0x08. The IP addresses translates to c0a80a05 (192.168.10.5) and c0a80a14 (192.168.10.20). When the string is assembled, it yields f108c0a80a05c0a80a14. The Cisco IOS IT Certification Guaranteed, The Easy Way! 81command that is added to the DHCP scope is option 43 hex f108c0a80a05c0a80a14.”
Reference: Click
Therefore in this question the option 43 in hex should be “F104.AC10.3205 (the management IP address of 172.16.50.5 in hex is AC.10.32.05).

ip route 172.16.1.0 255.255.255.0 Vlan20

Answer: A

Explanation
Static routes directly between VRFs are not supported so we cannot configure a direct static route between two VRFs.
The command “ip route vrf Customer1 172.16.1.0 255.255.255.0 172.16.1.1 global” means in VRF Customer1, in order to reach destination 172.16.1.0/24 then we uses the next hop IP address 172.16.1.1 in the global routing table. And the command “ip route 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0 Vlan10” tells the router “to reach 192.168.1.0/24, send to Vlan 10”.

Int is err-disabled because of BPDU

An engineer entered the command no spanning-tree bpduguard enable on interface Fa 1/0/7. What is the effect of this command on Fa 1/0/7?
A. It remains in err-disabled state until the shutdown/no shutdown command is entered in the interface configuration mode.
B. It remains in err-disabled state until the errdisable recovery cause failed-port-state command is entered in the global configuration mode.
C. It remains in err-disabled state until the no shutdown command is entered in the interface configuration mode.
D. It remains in err-disabled state until the spanning-tree portfast bpduguard disable command is entered in the interface configuration mode.

Answer: A

Explanation
Seems someone maybe trying to insert a switch into that port which sends bpdu packets. The port is configured to not allow this so it goes into an error disable mode and shuts the port down. You have to do a shut and no shut on the port to bring it back up. However, it may go down again if the device sending bpdu’s is still active on the port.

Question 275. 
what is a benefit of using a Type 2 hypervisor instead of a Type 1 hypervisor?
A. better application performance
B. Improved security because the underlying OS is eliminated
C. Improved density and scalability
D. ability to operate on hardware that is running other OSs

Answer: D

Explanation
There are two types of hypervisors: type 1 and type 2 hypervisor.
In type 1 hypervisor (or native hypervisor), the hypervisor is installed directly on the physical server.
Then instances of an operating system (OS) are installed on the hypervisor. Type 1 hypervisor has direct access to the hardware resources. Therefore they are more efficient than hosted architectures.
Some examples of type 1 hypervisor are VMware vSphere/ESXi, Oracle VM Server, KVM and Microsoft Hyper-V.
In contrast to type 1 hypervisor, a type 2 hypervisor (or hosted hypervisor) runs on top of an operating system and not the physical hardware directly. A big advantage of Type 2 hypervisors is that management console software is not required. Examples of type 2 hypervisor are VMware Workstation (which can run on Windows, Mac and Linux) or Microsoft Virtual PC (only runs on Windows).
Type 1 is more efficient and well performing, it is also more secure than type 2 because the flaws and vulnerabilities that are endemic to Operating Systems are often absent from Type 1, bare metal hypervisors.
Type 1 has better performance, scalability and stability but supported by limited hardware.

Question 279. 
A wireless consultant is designing a high-density wireless network for a lecture hall for 1000 students Which antenna type is recommended for this environment?
A. sector antenna
B. dipole antenna
C. parabolic dish
D. omnidirectional antenna

Answer: D

Explanation
Directional antennas Directional antennas come in many different styles and shapes. An antenna does not offer any added power to the signal; it simply redirects the energy it receives from the transmitter. By redirecting this energy, it has the effect of providing more energy in one direction and less energy in all other directions. As the gain of a directional antenna increases, the angle of radiation usually decreases, providing a greater coverage distance but with a reduced coverage angle. Directional antennas include patch antennas and parabolic dishes. Parabolic dishes have a very narrow RF energy path, and the installer must be accurate in aiming these types of antennas at each other.

Omnidirectional antennas An omnidirectional antenna is designed to provide a 360-degree radiation pattern. This type of antenna is used when coverage in all directions from the antenna is required. The standard 2.14-dBi “rubber duck” is one style of omnidirectional antenna. Omnidirectional antenna -> Therefore Omnidirectional antenna is best suited for a high-density wireless network in a lecture hall.

exec-timeout 600

Answer: C

Explanation
The “exec-timeout” command is used to configure the inactive session timeout on the console port or the virtual terminal. The syntax of this command is:
exec-timeout minutes [seconds]
Therefore we need to use the “exec-timeout 10 0” command to set the user inactivity timer to 600 seconds (10 minutes).

Int Tunnel0
IP address 172.16.1.1 255.255.255.0
Tunnel dest 192.168.10.2

Which command must be applied to Routed to bring the GRE tunnel to an up/up state?
A. Router1(config)#interface tunnel0
B. Router1(config-if)#tunnel source GigabitEthernet0/1
C. Router1(config-if)#tunnel mode gre multipoint
D. Router1(config-if)#tunnel source Loopback0

Answer: D

Explanation
In order to make a Point-to-Point GRE Tunnel interface in up/up state, two requirements must be met: + A valid tunnel source (which is in up/up state and has an IP address configured on it) and tunnel destination must be configured + A valid tunnel destination is one which is routable. However, it does not have to be reachable.

Question 282. 
Which QoS queuing method transmits packets out of the interface in the order the packets arrive?
A. custom
B. weighted- fair
C. FIFO
D. priority

Answer: C

Explanation
First-in, first-out (FIFO): FIFO entails no concept of priority or classes of traffic. With FIFO, transmission of packets out the interface occurs in the order the packets arrive, which means no QoS.

Question 284. 
In a traditional 3 tier topology, an engineer must explicitly configure a switch as the root bridge and exclude it from any further election process for the spanning-tree domain. Which action accomplishes this task?
A. Configure the spanning-tree priority to 32768
B. Configure root guard and portfast on all access switch ports.
C. Configure BPDU guard in all switch-to-switch connections.
D. Configure the spanning-tree priority equal to 0.

Answer: D

Explanation
Root guard does not allow the port to become a STP root port, so the port is always STP-designated. If a better BPDU arrives on this port, root guard does not take the BPDU into account and elect a new STP root. Instead, root guard puts the port into the root-inconsistent STP state which is equal to a listening state. No traffic is forwarded across this port.

Question 287. 
In a wireless Cisco SD-Access deployment, which roaming method is used when a user moves from one access point to another on a different access switch using a single WLC?
A. Layer 3
B. inter-xTR
C. auto anchor
D. fast roam

Answer: B

Explanation
SDA RoamingSDA supports two additional types of roaming, which are Intra-xTR and Inter-xTR. In SDA, xTR stands for an access-switch that is a fabric edge node. It serves both as an ingress tunnel router as well as an egress tunnel router.
Intra-xTR
When a client on a fabric enabled WLAN, roams from an access point to another access point on the same access-switch, it is called Intra-xTR. Here, the local client database and client history table are updated with the information of the newly associated access point.
Inter-xTR.
When a client on a fabric enabled WLAN, roams from an access point to another access point on a different access-switch, it is called Inter-xTR.

Question 288. 
What is one fact about Cisco SD-Access wireless network deployments?
A. The access point is part of the fabric underlay
B. The WLC is part of the fabric underlay
C. The access point is part the fabric overlay
D. The wireless client is part of the fabric overlay

Answer: C

Explanation
Access Points
+ AP is directly connected to FE (or to an extended node switch)
+ AP is part of Fabric overlay

Question 289. 
How does a fabric access point fit in the network?
A. It is in local mode an must be connected directly to the fabric border node.
B. It is in FlexConnect mode and must be connected directly to the fabric border node.
C. It is in local mode an must connected directly to the fabric edge switch.
D. It is in FlexConnect mode and must be connected directly to the fabric edge switch.

Answer: C

Explanation
Fabric mode APs continue to support the same wireless media services that traditional APs support;
apply AVC, quality of service (QoS), and other wireless policies; and establish the CAPWAP control plane to the fabric WLC. Fabric APs join as local-mode APs and must be directly connected to the fabric edge node switch to enable fabric registration events, including RLOC assignment via the fabric WLC. The fabric edge nodes use CDP to recognize APs as special wired hosts, applying special port configurations and assigning the APs to a unique overlay network within a common EID space across a fabric. The assignment allows management simplification by using a single subnet to cover the AP infrastructure at a fabric site.

Question 290. 
Refer to the exhibit. 

DSW2
Spanning tree enabled protocol rstp

What is the result when a switch that is running PVST+ is added to this network?
A. DSW2 operates in Rapid PVST+ and the new switch operates in PVST+
B. Both switches operate in the PVST+ mode
C. Spanning tree is disabled automatically on the network
D. Both switches operate in the Rapid PVST+ mode.

Answer: A

Explanation
From the output we see DSW2 is running in RSTP mode (in fact Rapid PVST+ mode as Cisco does not support RSTP alone). When a new switch running PVST+ mode is added to the topology, they keep running the old STP instances as RSTP (in fact Rapid PVST+) is compatible with PVST+.

Question 291. 
Refer to the exhibit. 

Make is Grocer
Model is Zoom

Features are Power windows, Manual Drive, Auto AC

What is the JSON syntax that is formed from the data?
A. { "Make”:’Gocar, “Model": “Zoom”, “Features”: [“Power Windows”, “Manual Dnve”, “Auto AC”]}
B. ‘Make “: “Gocar", “Model”: “Zoom”, “Features”: [“Power Windows”, “Manual Drive”, “Auto AC”]
C. {“Make”: Gocar, “Model”: Zoom, “Features”: Power Windows, Manual Drive, Auto AC}
D. (“Make”:[ “Gocar”, “Model”: “Zoom”], Features”: [“Power Windows”, “Manual Drive”, “Auto AC”]}

Answer: A

Explanation
JSON syntax structure: + uses curly braces {} to hold objects and square brackets [] to hold arrays + JSON data is written as key/value pairs + A key/value pair consists of a key (must be a string in double quotation marks “”), followed by a colon :, followed by a value. For example: “name”:”John” + Each key must be unique + Values must be of type string, number, object, array, boolean or null + Multiple key/value within an object are separated by commas , JSON can use arrays. Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable. For example:
{
“name”:”John”,
“age”:30,
“cars”:[ “Ford”, “BMW”, “Fiat”]
}
In the above example, “cars” is an array which contains three values “Ford”, “BMW” and “Fiat”.
Note: Although our correct answer above does not have curly braces to hold objects but it is still the best choice here.

Question 293. 
What is the differences between TCAM and the MAC address table?
A. The MAC address table is contained in CAM ACL and QoS information is stored in TCAM
B. The MAC address table supports partial matches. TCAM requires an exact match
C. Router prefix lookups happens in CAM. MAC address table lookups happen in TCAM.
D. TCAM is used to make Layer 2 forwarding decisions CAM is used to build routing tables

Answer: A

Explanation
When using Ternary Content Addressable Memory (TCAM) inside routers it’s used for faster address lookup that enables fast routing.
In switches Content Addressable Memory (CAM) is used for building and lookup of mac address table that enables L2 forwarding decisions.
Besides Longest-Prefix Matching, TCAM in today’s routers and multilayer Switch devices are used to store ACL, QoS and other things from upper-layer processing.

Question 295.
What is the function of a control-plane node in a Cisco SD-Access solution?
A. to run a mapping system that manages endpoint to network device relationships
B. to implement policies and communicate with networks outside the fabric
C. to connect external Layer 3 networks to the SD Access fabric.
D. to connect APs and wireless endpoints to the SD-Access fabric

Answer: A

Explanation
Control-Plane Nodes – Map System that manages Endpoint to Device relationships Fabric Border Nodes – A Fabric device (e.g. Core) that connects External L3 network(s) to the SDA Fabric Fabric Edge Nodes – A Fabric device (e.g. Access or Distribution) that connects Wired Endpoints to the SDA Fabric Fabric Wireless Controller – A Fabric device (WLC) that connects APs and Wireless Endpoints to the SDA Fabric

Question 296. 
After a redundant route processor failure occurs on a Layer 3 device, which mechanism allows for packets to be forwarded from a neighboring router based on the most recent tables?
A. RPVST+
B. NSF
C. BFD
D. RP failover

Answer: B

Explanation
Routers specifically designed for high availability include hardware redundancy, such as dual power supplies and route processors (RPs). An RP is responsible for learning the network topology and building the route table (RIB). An RP failure can trigger routing protocol adjacencies to reset, resulting in packet loss and network instability. During an RP failure, it may be more desirable to hide the failure and allow the router to continue forwarding packets using the previously programmed CEF table entries rather than temporarily drop packets while waiting for the secondary RP to reestablish the routing protocol adjacencies and rebuild the forwarding table.

Enabling nonstop forwarding (NSF) or nonstop routing (NSR) high availability capabilities informs the router(s) to maintain the CEF entries for a short duration and continue forwarding packets through an RP failure until the control plane recovers.

Question 297. 
Which two results occur if Cisco DNA Center loses connectivity to devices in the SD-Access fabric? (Choose two )
A. All devices reload after detecting loss of connection to Cisco DNA Center
B. Already connected users are unaffected, but new users cannot connect
C. User connectivity is unaffected.
D. Cisco DNA Center is unable to collect monitoring data in Assurance.
E. Users lose connectivity

Answer: CD

Explanation
If you have Cisco SD-Access implemented and DNA Center becomes unreachable then the wired and wireless network will continue to forward packets as usual. There will be no impact to network performance or behavior. Yes you will be able to SSH / telnet / console into switches and wireless network infrastructure as usual. For the period DNA Center is unreachable, Assurance data will be lost, and you will not be able to make configuration changes to the Cisco SD-Access network.

Question 298. 
Which measure is used by an NTP server to indicate its closeness to the authoritative time source?
A. time zone
B. hop count
C. stratum
D. latency

Answer: C

Explanation
The stratum levels define the distance from the reference clock. A reference clock is a stratum 0 device that is assumed to be accurate and has little or no delay associated with it. Stratum 0 servers cannot be used on the network but they are directly connected to computers which then operate as stratum-1 servers. A stratum 1 time server acts as a primary network time standard.

A stratum 2 server is connected to the stratum 1 server; then a stratum 3 server is connected to the stratum 2 server and so on. A stratum 2 server gets its time via NTP packet requests from a stratum 1 server. A stratum 3 server gets its time via NTP packet requests from a stratum-2 server…

Question 299. 
What is a characteristic of a next-generation firewall?
A. only required at the network perimeter
B. required in each layer of the network
C. filters traffic using Layer 3 and Layer 4 information only
D. provides intrusion prevention

Answer: D

Explanation
A next generation firewall adds additional features such as application control, integrated intrusion prevention (IPS) and often more advanced threat prevention capabilities like sandboxing.

Question 300. 
Which two components are supported by LISP? (choose two )
A. proxy ETR
B. egress tunnel router
C. route reflector
D. HMAC algorithm
E. spoke

Answer: AB

Explanation
An Egress Tunnel Router (ETR) connects a site to the LISP-capable part of a core network (such as the Internet), publishes EID-to-RLOC mappings for the site, responds to MapRequest messages, and decapsulates and delivers LISP-encapsulated user data to end systems at the site.
A LISP proxy ETR (PETR) implements ETR functions on behalf of non-LISP sites. A PETR is typically used when a LISP site needs to send traffic to non-LISP sites but the LISP site is connected through a service provider that does not accept nonroutable EIDs as packet sources. PETRs act just like ETRs but for EIDs that send traffic to destinations at non-LISP sites

Question 301. 
A customer has recently implemented a new wireless infrastructure using WLC-5520S at a site directly next to a large commercial airport Users report that they intermittently lose Wi-Fi connectivity, and troubleshooting reveals it is due to frequent channel changes Which two actions fix this issue? (Choose two)
A. Remove UNII-2 and Extended UNII-2 channels from the 5 Ghz channel list
B. Restore the OCA default settings because this automatically avoids channel interference
C. Disable DFS channels to prevent interference writ) Doppler radar
D. Enable DFS channels because they are immune to radar interference
E. Configure channels on the UNII-2 and the Extended UNII-2 sub-bands of the 5 Ghz band only

Answer: AC

Explanation
In the 5GHz spectrum some of the channels used by 802.11 are subject to Dynamic Frequency Selection (DFS) requirements. This is due to our clients coexistence with other RF technologies such as Maritime, Aviation and Weather RADAR.
Dynamic Frequency Selection (DFS) is the process of detecting radar signals that must be protected against interference from 5.0 GHz (802.11a/h) radios, and upon detection switching the operating frequency of the 5.0 GHz (802.11a/h) radio to one that is not interfering with the radar systems.

Although DFS helps reduce interference with radar systems but “DFS channels” refer to the 5GHz channels that require DFS check. In other words, DFS channels are channels that may interfere with radar signal.
Therefore we should disable these DFS channels -> Answer C is correct.
UNII-2 (5.250-5.350 GHz and 5.470-5.725 GHz) which contains channels 52, 56, 60, 64, 100, 104, 108, 112, 116, 120, 124, 128, 132, 136, and 140 are permitted in the United States, but shared with radar systems.
Therefore, APs operating on UNII-2 channels are required to use Dynamic Frequency Selection (DFS) to avoid interfering with radar signals. If an AP detects a radar signal, it must immediately stop using that channel and randomly pick a new channel.

Question 302. 
Refer to the exhibit. 

Spanning tree enabled protocol ieee

What does the output confirm about the switch’s spanning tree configuration?
A. The spanning-tree mode stp ieee command was entered on this switch
B. The spanning-tree operation mode for this switch is PVST.
C. The spanning-tree operation mode for this switch is PVST+.
D. The spanning-tree operation mode for this switch is IEEE

Answer: C

Explanation
The default spanning-tree mode in Cisco switch is PVST+. This spanning-tree mode is based on the IEEE 802.1D standard and Cisco proprietary extensions. PVST+ is same as standard IEEE 802.1D but it runs on each VLAN. In the output we see the line “Spanning tree enabled protocol ieee” under “VLAN 20” so it can say the switch is running in PVST+ mode.

Question 303. 
How does EIGRP differ from OSPF?
A. EIGRP is more prone to routing loops than OSPF
B. EIGRP has a full map of the topology, and OSPF only knows directly connected neighbors
C. EIGRP supports equal or unequal path cost, and OSPF supports only equal path cost.
D. EIGRP uses more CPU and memory than OSPF

Answer: C

Explanation
OSPF maintains information about all the networks and running routers in its area. Each time there is a change within the area, all routers need to re-sync their database and then run SPF again. This process makes it more CPU intensive. EIGRP, on the other hand, has triggered and incremental updates. Therefore EIGRP is more efficient in terms of CPU usage and memory.

Question 304. 
What is a characteristic of para-virtualization?
A. Para-virtualization guest servers are unaware of one another
B. Para-virtualization allows direct access between the guest OS and the hypervisor
C. Para-virtualization allows the host hardware to be directly accessed
D. Para-virtualization lacks support for containers

Answer: C

Explanation
Paravirtualization works differently from the full virtualization. It doesn’t need to simulate the hardware for the virtual machines. The hypervisor is installed on a physical server (host) and a guest OS is installed into the environment. Virtual guests aware that it has been virtualized, unlike the full virtualization (where the guest doesn’t know that it has been virtualized) to take advantage of the functions.
In full virtualization, guests will issue a hardware calls but in paravirtualization, guests will directly communicate with the host (hypervisor) using drivers.

Question 305. 
Which solution do laaS service providers use to extend a Layer 2 segment across a Layer 3 network?
A. VLAN

Explanation

Question 306. 
A customer requests a network design that supports these requirements:
* FHRP redundancy
* multivendor router environment
* IPv4 and IPv6 hosts
Which protocol does the design include?
A. GLBP
B. VRRP version 2
C. VRRP version 3
D. HSRP version 2

Answer: C

Explanation
Unlike HSRP or GLBP, VRPP is an open standard. Only VRRPv3 supports both IPv4 and IPv6.

Question 307. 
Which unit measures the power of a radio signal with reference to 1 milliwatt?
A. dBw
B. dBm
C. mW
D. dBi

Answer: B

Explanation
dBm is an abbreviation for “decibels relative to one milliwatt,” where one milliwatt (1 mW) equals 1/1000 of a watt. It follows the same scale as dB. Therefore 0 dBm = 1 mW, 30 dBm = 1 W, and -20 dBm = 0.01 mW

Question 308. 
What is a characteristic of MACsec?
A. 802.1AE provides encryption and authentication services
B. 802.1AE is built between the host and switch using the MKA protocol, which negotiates encryption keys based on the master session key from a successful 802.1X session
C. 802.1AE is built between the host and switch using the MKA protocol using keys generated via the Diffie-Hellman algorithm (anonymous encryption mode)
D. 802.1AE is negotiated using Cisco AnyConnect NAM and the SAP protocol

Answer: B

Explanation
MACsec, defined in 802.1AE, provides MAC-layer encryption over wired networks by using out-of-band methods for encryption keying. The MACsec Key Agreement (MKA) Protocol provides the required session keys and manages the required encryption keys. MKA and MACsec are implemented after successful authentication using the 802.1x Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP-TLS) or Pre Shared Key (PSK) framework.

Reference: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst9300/software/release/16-9/configuration_guide/sec/b_169_sec_9300_cg/macsec_encryption.html

-> MACsec only provides encryption, not authentication -> Answer A is not correct.

Successful IEEE 802.1X authentication is the first step in establishing a MACsec session. IEEE 802.1X provides primary key material to the supplicant and switch that will subsequently be used by MACsec -> Answer B is correct.

If an MKA cryptographic algorithm is not configured, a default cryptographic algorithm of AES-CMAC-128 (Cipher-based Message Authentication Code with 128-bit Advanced Encryption Standard) is used -> Answer C is not correct.

Reference: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/macsec/configuration/xe-16/macsec-xe-16-book/wan-macsec-mka-support-enhance.html

802.1AE is negotiated using MKA Protocol so answer D is not correct.

Question 311. 
What are two characteristics of Cisco SD-Access elements? (Choose two)
A. The border node is required for communication between fabric and nonfabric devices.
B. Fabric endpoints are connected directly to the border node
C. Traffic within the fabric always goes through the control plane node
D. The control plane node has the full RLOC-to-EID mapping database
E. The border node has the full RLOC-to-EID mapping database

Answer: AD

Explanation
There are five basic device roles in the fabric overlay:
+ Control plane node: This node contains the settings, protocols, and mapping tables to provide the endpoint-to-location (EID-to-RLOC) mapping system for the fabric overlay.
+ Fabric border node: This fabric device (for example, core layer device) connects external Layer 3 networks to the SDA fabric.
+ Fabric edge node: This fabric device (for example, access or distribution layer device) connects wired endpoints to the SDA fabric.
+ Fabric WLAN controller (WLC): This fabric device connects APs and wireless endpoints to the SDA fabric.
+ Intermediate nodes: These are intermediate routers or extended switches that do not provide any sort of SD-Access fabric role other than underlay services.

Question 312. 
What is the data policy in a Cisco SD-WAN deployment?
A. list of ordered statements that define node configurations and authentication used within the SDWAN overlay
B. Set of statements that defines how data is forwarded based on IP packet information and specific VPNs
C. detailed database mapping several kinds of addresses with their corresponding location
D. group of services tested to guarantee devices and links liveliness within the SD-WAN overlay

Answer: B

Explanation
Data policy operates on the data plane in the Cisco SD-WAN overlay network and affects how data traffic is sent among Cisco SD-WAN devices in the network. The Cisco SD-WAN architecture defines two types of data policy, centralized data policy, which controls the flow of data traffic based on the IP header fields in the data packets and based on network segmentation, and localized data policy, which controls the flow of data traffic into and out of interfaces and interface queues on the devices.

Question 335. 
The following system log message is presented after a network administrator configures a GRE tunnel:
%TUN-RECURDOWN: Interface Tunnel 0 temporarily disabled due to recursive routing.
Why is Tunnel 0 disabled?
A. Because dynamic routing is not enabled
B. Because the tunnel cannot reach its tunnel destination
C. Because the best path to the tunnel destination is through the tunnel itself
D. Because the router cannot recursively identify its egress forwarding interface.

Answer: C

Explanation
The %TUN-5-RECURDOWN: Tunnel0 temporarily disabled due to recursive routing error message means that the generic routing encapsulation (GRE) tunnel router has discovered a recursive routing problem. This condition is usually due to one of these causes:
+ A misconfiguration that causes the router to try to route to the tunnel destination address using the tunnel interface itself (recursive routing)
+ A temporary instability caused by route flapping elsewhere in the network

D. Configure an ip helper-address on the router interface
E. Enable port security on the switch port

Answer: CD

Explanation
In a Cisco Unified Wireless network, the LAPs must first discover and join a WLC before they can service wireless clients.
However, this presents a question: how did the LAPs find the management IP address of the controller when it is on a different subnet?
If you do not tell the LAP where the controller is via DHCP option 43, DNS resolution of “Cisco-capwap-controller.local_domain”, or statically configure it, the LAP does not know where in the network to find the management interface of the controller.

Question 337. 
What is provided by the Stealthwatch component of the Cisco Cyber Threat Defense solution?
A. real-time threat management to stop DDoS attacks to the core and access networks
B. real-time awareness of users, devices and traffic on the network
C. malware control
D. dynamic threat control for web traffic

Answer: B

Explanation
Cisco Stealthwatch is a comprehensive, network telemetry-based, security monitoring and analytics solution that streamlines incident response through behavioral analysis; detecting denial of service attacks, anomalous behaviour, malicious activity and insider threats. Based on a scalable enterprise architecture, Stealthwatch provides near real-time situational awareness of all users and devices on the network.
Reference: https://www.endace.com/cisco-stealthwatch-solution-brief.pdf
Note: Although answer A seems to be correct but in fact, Stealthwatch does not provide real-time protection for DDoS attack. It just helps detect DDoS attack only.
Stealthwatch aggregates observed network activity and performs behavioral and policy driven analytics against what it sees in order to surface problematic activities. While we don’t position our self as a DDOS solution, we’re going to leverage our analytical capabilities to identify a DDoS attack against an internal host using the WebUI.

Question 338. 
How does Protocol Independent Multicast function?
A. In sparse mode it establishes neighbor adjacencies and sends hello messages at 5-second intervals.
B. It uses the multicast routing table to perform the multicast forwarding function.
C. It uses unicast routing information to perform the multicast forwarding function.
D. It uses broadcast routing information to perform the multicast forwarding function.

Answer: C

Explanation
Although PIM is called a multicast routing protocol, it actually uses the unicast routing table to perform the reverse path forwarding (RPF) check function instead of building up a completely independent multicast routing table. Unlike other routing protocols, PIM does not send and receive routing updates between routers.

Question 347.
What is the recommended MTU size for a Cisco SD-Access Fabric?
A. 1500
B. 9100
C. 4464
D. 17914

Answer: B

Explanation
VXLAN adds 50 bytes to the original packet. The common denominator and recommended MTU value available on devices operating in a fabric role is 9100. Network should have a minimum starting MTU of at least 1550 bytes to support the fabric overlay. MTU values between 1550 and 9100 are supported along with MTU values larger than 9100 though there may be additional configuration and limitations based on the original packet size.
MTU 9100 is provisioned as part of LAN Automation. Devices in the same routing domain and Layer 2 domain should be configured with a consistent MTU size to support routing protocol adjacencies and packet forwarding without fragmentation.

Question 348. 
What Is the process for moving a virtual machine from one host machine to another with no downtime?
A. high availability
B. disaster recovery
C. live migration
D. multisite replication

Answer: C

Explanation
Live migration refers to the process of moving a running virtual machine or application between different physical machines without disconnecting the client or application. Memory, storage, and network connectivity of the virtual machine are transferred from the original guest machine to the destination. An example of live migration tool is VMware vSphere vMotion.

Question 349. 
What are two features of NetFlow flow monitoring? (Choose two.)
A. Copies all ingress flow information to an interface
B. Include the flow record and the flow importer
C. Can track ingress and egress information
D. Can be used to track multicast, MPLS, or bridged traffic.
E. Does not required packet sampling on interfaces

Answer: CD

Explanation
The following are restrictions for Flexible NetFlow:
+ Traditional NetFlow (TNF) accounting is not supported.
+ Flexible NetFlow v5 export format is not supported, only NetFlow v9 export format is supported.
+ Both ingress and egress NetFlow accounting is supported.
+ Microflow policing feature shares the NetFlow hardware resource with FNF.
+ Only one flow monitor per interface and per direction is supported.
When configuring NetFlow, follow these guidelines and restrictions:
+ Except in PFC3A mode, NetFlow supports bridged IP traffic. PFC3A mode does not support NetFlow bridged IP traffic.
+ NetFlow supports multicast IP traffic.
The Flexible NetFlow – MPLS Egress NetFlow feature allows you to capture IP flow information for packets that arrive on a router as Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) packets and are transmitted as IP packets.
This feature allows you to capture the MPLS VPN IP flows that are traveling through the service provider 

Question 350. 
Refer to the exhibit. 

Circular and two bulges

Which type of antenna is show on the radiation patterns?
A. Dipole
B. Yagi
C. Patch
D. Omnidirectional

Answer: A

Explanation
A dipole antenna most commonly refers to a half-wavelength (/2) dipole. The physical antenna (not the package that it is in) is constructed of conductive elements whose combined length is about half of a wavelength at its intended frequency of operation. This is a simple antenna that radiates its energy out toward the horizon (perpendicular to the antenna). The patterns shown are those resulting from a perfect dipole formed with two thin wires oriented vertically along the z axis.

Question 351. 
What is the wireless received signal strength indicator?
A. The value given to the strength of the wireless signal received compared to the noise level
B. The value of how strong the wireless signal Is leaving the antenna using transmit power, cable loss, and antenna gain
C. The value of how much wireless signal is lost over a defined amount of distance
D. The value of how strong a tireless signal is receded, measured in dBm

Answer: D

Explanation
RSSI, or “Received Signal Strength Indicator,” is a measurement of how well your device can hear a signal from an access point or router. It’s a value that is useful for determining if you have enough signal to get a good wireless connection.
This value is measured in decibels (dBm) from 0 (zero) to -120 (minus 120). The closer to 0 (zero) the stronger the signal is which means it’s better, typically voice networks require a -65db or better signal level while a data network needs -80db or better.

Question 353. 
Which protocol is implemented to establish secure control plane adjacencies between Cisco SD-WAN nodes?
A. IKE
B. DTLS
C. IPsec
D. ESP

Answer: B

Explanation
The Cisco SD-WAN control plane has been designed with network and device security in mind. The foundation of the control plane is one of two security protocols derived from SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)-the Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) protocol and the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol.

Question 354. 
What does the number in an NTP stratum level represent?
A. The number of hops it takes to reach the master time server.
B. The number of hops it takes to reach the authoritative time source.
C. The amount of offset between the device clock and true time.
D. The amount of drift between the device clock and true time.

Answer: B

Explanation
NTP uses the concept of a stratum to describe how many hops (routers) away a machine is from an authoritative time source, usually a reference clock. A reference clock is a stratum 0 device that is assumed to be accurate and has little or no delay associated with it. Stratum 0 servers cannot be used on the network but they are directly connected to computers which then operate as stratum-1 servers. A stratum 1 time server acts as a primary network time standard.

The last command should be “R1(config)#ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 172.20.20.2 track 10”.

Question 357. 
Which controller is capable of acting as a STUN server during the onboarding process of Edge devices?
A. vBond
B. vSmart
C. vManage
D. PNP server

Answer: A

Explanation
vbond-as-stun-server:
Enable Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) to allow the tunnel interface to discover its public IP address and port number when the vEdge router is located behind a NAT (on vEdge routers only).
When you configure this command, vEdge routers can exchange their public IP addresses and port numbers over private TLOCs.
With this configuration, the vEdge router uses the vBond orchestrator as a STUN server, so the router can determine its public IP address and public port number. (With this configuration, the router cannot learn the type of NAT that it is behind.)
No overlay network control traffic is sent and no keys are exchanged over tunnel interface configured to the the vBond orchestrator as a STUN server. However, BFD does come up on the tunnel, and data traffic can be sent on it.

Question 358. 
When does a stack master lose its role?
A. When the priority value of a stack member is changed to a higher value
B. when a switch with a higher priority is added to the stack
C. when the stack master is reset
D. when a stack member fails

Answer: C

Explanation
A stack master retains its role unless one of these events occurs:
The switch stack is reset.*
The stack master is removed from the switch stack.
The stack master is reset or powered off.
The stack master fails.
The switch stack membership is increased by adding powered-on standalone switches or switch stacks.*
In the events marked by an asterisk (*), the current stack master might be re-elected based on the listed factors.
When you power on or reset an entire switch stack, some stack members might not participate in the stack master election. Stack members that are powered on within the same 20-second time frame participate in the stack master election and have a chance to become the stack master. Stack members that are powered on after the 20-second time frame do not participate in this initial election and become stack members. All stack members participate in re-elections. For all powering considerations that affect stack-master elections, see the “Switch Installation” chapter in the hardware installation guide.
The new stack master becomes available after a few seconds. In the meantime, the switch stack uses the forwarding tables in memory to minimize network disruption. The physical interfaces on the other available stack members are not affected during a new stack master election and reset.
After a new stack master is elected and the previous stack master becomes available, the previous stack master does not resume its role as stack master.
As described in the hardware installation guide, you can use the Master LED on the switch to see if the switch is the stack master.

Question 360. 
What is the calculation that is used to measure the radiated power of a signal after it has gone through the radio, antenna cable, and antenna?
A. EIRP
B. mW
C. dBm
D. dBi

Answer: A

Explanation
Once you know the complete combination of transmitter power level, the length of cable, and the antenna gain, you can figure out the actual power level that will beradiated from the antenna. This is known as the effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP), measured in dBm. EIRP is a very important parameter because it is regulated by governmental agencies in most countries. In those cases, a system cannot radiate signals higher than a maximum allowable EIRP. To find the EIRP of a system, simply add the transmitter power level to the antenna gain and subtract the cable loss.
Suppose a transmitter is configured for a power level of 10 dBm (10 mW). A cable with 5-dB loss connects the transmitter to an antenna with an 8-dBi gain. The resultingEIRP of the system is 10 dBm – 5 dB + 8 dBi, or 13 dBm.
You might notice that the EIRP is made up of decibel-milliwatt (dBm), dB relative to an isotropic antenna (dBi), and decibel (dB) values. Even though the units appear tobe different, you can safely combine them because they are all in the dB “domain”.

Question 361. 
An engineer is concerned with the deployment of a new application that is sensitive to inter-packet delay variance. Which command configures the router to be the destination of jitter measurements?
A. Router(config)# ip sla responder udp-connect 172.29.139.134 5000
B. Router(config)# ip sla responder tcp-connect 172.29.139.134 5000
C. Router(config)# ip sla responder udp-echo 172.29.139.134 5000
D. Router(config)# ip sla responder tcp-echo 172.29.139.134 5000

Answer: C

Explanation
Cisco IOS IP SLA Responder is a Cisco IOS Software component whose functionality is to respond to Cisco IOS IP SLA request packets. The IP SLA source sends control packets before the operation starts to establish a connection to the responder. Once the control packet is acknowledged, test packets are sent to the responder. The responder inserts a time-stamp when it receives a packet and factors out the destination processing time and adds time-stamps to the sent packets. This feature allows the calculation of unidirectional packet loss, latency, and jitter measurements with the kind of accuracy that is not possible with ping or other dedicated probe testing.
Reference:
UDP Jitter measures the delay, delay variation (jitter), corruption, misordering and packet loss by generating periodic UDP traffic. This operation always requires IP SLA responder. The command to enable UDP Jitter Operation is “ip sla responder udp-echo {destination-ip-address} [destination-port]

SW2
Group	Port-channel	Protocol		Ports
1	Po1(SD)		-		G0/0(I) G0/1(I)

An engineer is configuring an EtherChannel between Switch1 and Switch2 and notices the console message on Switch2. Based on the output, which action resolves this issue?
A. Configure less member ports on Switch2.
B. Configure the same port channel interface number on both switches
C. Configure the same EtherChannel protocol on both switches
D. Configure more member ports on Switch1.

Answer: C

Explanation
In this case, we are using your EtherChannel without a negotiation protocol on Switch2. As a result, if
the opposite switch is not also configured for EtherChannel operation on the respective ports, there is a danger of a switching loop. The EtherChannel Misconfiguration Guard tries to prevent that loop from occuring by disabling all the ports bundled in the EtherChannel.

A network administrator configured RSPAN to troubleshoot an issue between switchl and switch2. The switches are connected using interface GigabitEthernet 1/1 An external packet capture device is connected to swich2 interface GigabitEthernet1/2 Which two commands must be added to complete this configuration? (Choose two)

A.
switch1(config)# interface GigabitEthernet 1/1 switch1(config-if)# switchport mode access
switch1(config-if)# switchport access vlan 10 switch2(config)# interface GigabitEthernet 1/1
switch2(config-if)# switchport mode access switch2(config-if)# switchport access vlan 10

B.

destination interface GigabitEthernet1/1

D.
switch2(config)# monitor session 2 destination vlan 10

E. 
switch2(config)# monitor session 1 source remote vlan 70
switch2(config)# monitor session 1 destination interface GigabitEthernet1/2

Answer: BE

Explanation
Switch2 is not allowing VLAN 70 which is used on Switch1 for RSPAN
so we must allow it -> Option B is correct (although it would not allow VLAN 81 to 90 to go through).
“An external packet capture device is connected to switch2 interface GigabitEthernet1/2” so we must configure Gi1/2 as the destination port.
For your information, this is how to configure Remote SPAN (RSPAN) feature on two switches. Traffic on FastEthernet0/1 of Switch 1 will be sent to Fa0/10 of Switch2 via VLAN 40.
+ Configure on both switches
Switch1,2(config)#vlan 40
Switch1,2(config-vlan)#remote-span
+ Configure on Switch1
Switch1(config)# monitor session 1 source interface FastEthernet 0/1
Switch1(config)# monitor session 1 destination remote vlan 40
+ Configure on Switch2

Question 380. 
Which three resources must the hypervisor make available to the virtual machines? (Choose three)
A. memory
B. bandwidth
C. IP address
D. processor
E. storage
F. secure access

Answer: ADE

Explanation

Question 381. 
What is the function of vBond in a Cisco SDWAN deployment?
A. initiating connections with SD-WAN routers automatically
B. pushing of configuration toward SD-WAN routers
C. onboarding of SDWAN routers into the SD-WAN overlay
D. gathering telemetry data from SD-WAN routers

Answer: C

Explanation
Orchestration plane (vBond) assists in securely onboarding the SD-WAN WAN Edge routers into the SD-WAN overlay. The vBond controller, or orchestrator, authenticates and authorizes the SD-WAN components onto the network. The vBond orchestrator takes an added responsibility to distribute the list of vSmart and vManage controller
 information to the WAN Edge routers. vBond is the only device in SD-WAN that requires a public IP address as it is the first point of contact and authentication for all SD-WAN components to join the SD-WAN fabric. All other components need to know the vBond IP or DNS information.

Explanation

Question 385. 
Which design principle should be followed in a Cisco SD-Access wireless network deployment?
A. The WLC is connected outside of the fabric
B. The WLC is part of the fabric underlay
C. The access point is connected outside of the fabric.
D. The WLC is part of the fabric overlay.

Answer: A

Explanation
WLC
– WLC is connected outside Fabric (optionally directly to Border)
– WLC needs to reside in global routing table – to talk to CP!
– No need for inter-VRF leaking for AP to join the WLC
– WLC can only belong to one FD. WLC talks to one CP (two for HA)
Access Points
– AP is directly connected to FE (or to an extended node switch)
– AP is part of Fabric overlay
– AP belongs to the INFRA_VN which is mapped to the global routing table (new in DNAC 1.1)
– AP joins the WLC in Local mode

Question 388. 
What is a type 2 hypervisor?
A. Installed as an application on an already installed operating system.
B. Runs directly on a physical server and includes its own operating system.
C. Supports over-allocation of physical resources.
D. Also referred to as a “bare metal hypervisor” because it sits directly on the physical server.

Answer: A

Explanation
 There are two types of hypervisors: type 1 and type 2 hypervisor.
 In type 1 hypervisor (or native hypervisor), the hypervisor is installed directly on the physical server. Then instances of an operating system (OS) are installed on the hypervisor. Type 1 hypervisor has direct access to the hardware resources. Therefore they are more efficient than hosted architectures. Some examples of type 1 hypervisor are VMware vSphere/ESXi, Oracle VM Server, KVM and Microsoft Hyper-V.
 In contrast to type 1 hypervisor, a type 2 hypervisor (or hosted hypervisor) runs on top of an operating system and not the physical hardware directly. A big advantage of Type 2 hypervisors is that management console software is not required. Examples of type 2 hypervisor are VMware Workstation (which can run on Windows, Mac and Linux) or
 Microsoft Virtual PC (only runs on Windows).

Question 396. 
What is the centralized control policy in a Cisco SD-WAN deployment?
A. list of ordered statements that define user access policies
B. set of statements that defines how routing is performed
C. set of rules that governs nodes authentication within the cloud
D. list of enabled services for all nodes within the cloud

Answer: B

Explanation
 In Cisco SD-WAN, there are two types of Centralized Control Policies that fulfill different objectives:
 + Topology – Topology policies control the route information such as omp, tloc, and service routes that are being redistributed to a list of sites. As the name implies, they are typically used for limiting the number of overlay tunnels between sites and controlling the overlay topology.
 + VPN Membership – VPN Membership policies are used to control the distribution of routing information for specific VPNs to a list of sites. A typical use-case is for creating guest networks that have Internet access but site-to-site communication is restricted.

What is the function of the LISP map resolver?
A. to send traffic to non-LISP sites when connected to a service provider that does not accept nonroutable EIDs as packet sources
B. to connect a site to the LISP-capable part of a core network, publish the EID-to-RLOC mappings for the site and respond to map-request messages
C. to decapsulate map-request messages from ITRs and forward the messages to the MS
D. to advertise routable non-USP traffic from one address family to LISP sites in a different address family

Answer: C

Explanation
Map Resolver (MR): a LISP component which accepts LISP Encapsulated Map Requests, typically from an ITR, quickly determines whether or not the destination IP address is part of the EID namespace

Question 401. 
What are two benefits of virtual switching when compared to hardware switching? (Choose two.)
A. increased MTU size
B. hardware independence
C. VM-level isolation
D. increased flexibility
E. extended 802.1Q VLAN range

Answer: CD

Explanation
 Virtual switches have benefits as well as virtual machines attached to them. They boost security by leveraging isolation, control and content inspection methods between virtual machines, which helps deter inter-switch link attacks.
 Moreover, with virtual switches, network administrators can control them with a hypervisor. Additionally, virtual switches can help with the migration of virtual machines across physical hosts by eliminating the need to reconfigure
 each virtual machine. They can also enhance operational efficiency, improve communications and scale system bandwidth capacity.

Question 402. 
How are the different versions of IGMP compatible?
A. IGMPv2 is compatible only with IGMPv1.
B. IGMPv2 is compatible only with IGMPv2.
C. IGMPv3 is compatible only with IGMPv3.
D. IGMPv3 is compatible only with IGMPv1

Answer: A

Explanation
IGMPv3 is backward compatible with previous versions of the IGMP protocol. In order to remain backward compatible with older IGMP systems, IGMPv3 multicast routers MUST also implement versions 1 and 2 of the protocol.
 Reference: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3376
  IGMPv2 is only compatible with IGMPv1
 Note: When saying “compatible”, we only mention about older version, not newer version. For example, we cannot say “IGMPv2 is compatible with IGMPv3” because IGMPv3 is newer. But we can say “IGMPv3 is compatible with IGMPv2”.

Question 405. 
What are two characteristics of VXLAN? (Choose two)
A. It uses VTEPs to encapsulate and decapsulate frames.
B. It has a 12-bit network identifier
C. It allows for up to 16 million VXLAN segments
D. It lacks support for host mobility
E. It extends Layer 2 and Layer 3 overlay networks over a Layer 2 underlay.

Answer: AC

Explanation
 VXLAN has a 24-bit VXLAN network identifier (VNI), which allows for up to 16 million (= 224) VXLAN segments to coexist within the same infrastructure. This surely solve the small number of traditional VLANs -> The first problem of VLAN has been resolved.
 VTEPs connect between Overlay and Underlay network and they are responsible for encapsulating frame into VXLAN packets to send across IP network (Underlay) then decapsulating when the packets leaves the VXLAN tunnel.
  VXLAN is a virtual overlay network which runs on the top of a physical underlay network. The underlay network may use any Layer 3 routing protocol like OSPF, EIGRP, IS-IS... to route packets so no Spanning Tree Protocol is required -> One of the major benefits of VXLAN technology is that it allows creating virtual Layer 2 segments over
 Layer 3 routed networks. Therefore answer C is not correct because “It extends Layer 2 and Layer 3 overlay networks over a Layer 3 underlay” (not Layer 2 underlay).

Question 406. 
Which entity is a Type 1 hypervisor?
A. Oracle VM VirtualBox

C. centrally switched back to WLC where the user traffic is mapped to a VLAN on the WLC
D. converted by the AP into 802.3 and encapsulated into a VLAN

Answer: B

Explanation
 For a fabric-enabled SSID, the AP converts 802.11 traffic to 802.3 and encapsulates it into VXLAN, encoding the VNI and SGT information of the client.

Which features does Cisco EDR use to provide threat detection and response protection?
A. containment, threat intelligence, and machine learning
B. firewalling and intrusion prevention
C. container-based agents
D. cloud analysis and endpoint firewall controls

Answer: A

Explanation
 In addition to continuous file analysis, it is important to note that an EDR is only as good at detecting files as the cyber threat intelligence that powers it. Cyber threat intelligence leverages large-scale data, machine learning capabilities,
 and advanced file analysis to help detect threats. The greater the cyber threat intelligence, the more likely it is your EDR solution will identify the threat. Without any cyber threat intelligence, an EDR solution is ineffective.
 After detecting a malicious file, an EDR solution must be able to contain the threat. Malicious files aim to infect as many processes, applications, and users as possible. Segmentation can be a great defense within your data center to avoid lateral movement of advanced threats. Segmentation is helpful, but a proper EDR solution can help contain a malicious file before testing the edges of segmented areas of the network. Ransomware is a tremendous example of why you need to contain threats. Ransomware can be tricky to remove. Once it has encrypted information, your EDR needs to be able to fully contain ransomware to mitigate the damages.

R2# DUPADDR: Duplicate address 10.10.1.1 on F1/0 sourced by 0000.0c07.ac28

An engineer configures a new HSRP group. While reviewing the HSRP status, the engineer sees the logging message generated on R2. Which is the cause of the message?
A. The same virtual IP address has been configured for two HSRP groups
B. The HSRP configuration has caused a spanning-tree loop
C. The HSRP configuration has caused a routing loop
D. A PC is on the network using the IP address 10.10.1.1

Answer: A

Explanation
 These messages specifically indicate that the router received a data packet that was sourced from the MAC addresses 0000.0c07.ac28, which is different from the MAC address of our HSRP group (0000.0c07.ac32). We also notice that 0000.0c07.ac28 is the virtual MAC address of another HSRP group (group 40 in particular; as 28 in hexadecimal equals to 40 in decimal).
 Note: If the source MAC address of the error message is the same as our HSRP MAC address then the most likely cause is STP loop as our router received its own packet back.

Question 425. 
How is Layer 3 roaming accomplished in a unified wireless deployment?
A. An EoIP tunnel is created between the client and the anchor controller to provide seamless connectivity as the client is associated with the new AP.
B. The client entry on the original controller is passed to the database on the new controller.
C. The new controller assigns an IP address from the new subnet to the client
D. The client database on the original controller is updated the anchor entry, and the new controller database is updated with the foreign entry.

Answer: D

Explanation
 An EoIP tunnel is created between the anchor and foreign controller, not between the client and the anchor controller -
 > Answer A is not correct.
 In instances where the client roams between APs that are connected to different WLCs and the WLC WLAN is connected to a different subnet, a Layer 3 roam is performed, and there is an update between the new WLC (foreign WLC) and
 the old WLC (anchor WLC) mobility databases.

 The client begins with a connection to AP B on WLC 1. This creates an ANCHOR entry in the WLC client database (-> Answer D is correct as the client database is marked “ANCHOR”). As the client moves away from AP B and makes an association
 with AP C, WLC 2 sends a mobility announcement to peers in the mobility group looking for the WLC with the client MAC address. WLC 1 responds to the announcement, handshakes, and ACKs. Next the client database entry for the roaming client is copied to WLC 2, and marked as FOREIGN. Included PMK data (master key data from the RADIUS
 server) is also copied to WLC 2. This provides fast roam times for WPA2/802.11i clients because there is no need to re-authenticate to the RADIUS server.
 After a simple key exchange between the client and AP, the client is added to the WLC 2 database and is similar, except that it is marked as FOREIGN.
 Reference: https://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/solutions/Enterprise/Mobility/emob30dg/TechArch.html and https://mr
   ncciew.com/2013/03/17/l3-inter-controller-roaming/
  In Layer 3 roaming, no IP address refresh needed (although client must be re-authenticated and new security session established) -> Answer C is not correct.
 In summary, the “Mobility State” of a client is described below:
 + Before roaming: Mobility State = Local
 + After roaming: Mobility State on Old Database = Anchor; Mobility State on New Database = Foreign
 Therefore the client entry on the original controller is not passed to the database totally. The client entry is still on the old controller but it is marked “Anchor” -> Answer B is not correct.

B. Monitor session 2 source int g0/3 tx
Monitor session 2 filter vlan 3
C. Monitor session 2 source int g0/3 tx
Monitor session 2 filter vlan 1-2, 4-4094
D. Monitor session 2 source int g0/3 rx
Monitor session 2 filter vlan 1-2, 4-4094

Answer: B

Explanation
 To “capture outgoing traffic” we have to use “tx” (transmitted) keyword. To only monitor VLAN 3 we have to use “monitor session 2 filter vlan 3”.

Question 428. 
How is MSDP used to interconnect multiple PIM-SM domains?
A. MSDP depends on BGP or multiprotocol BGP for interdomain operation.
B. MSDP SA request messages are used to request a list of active sources for a specific group
C. MSDP allows a rendezvous point to dynamically discover active sources outside of its domain
D. MSDP messages are used to advertise active sources in a domain

Answer: A

Explanation
 SA request messages are used to request a list of active sources for a specific group. These messages are sent to an MSDP SA cache that maintains a list of active (S, G) pairs in its SA cache -> Answer C is correct.
 SA response messages are sent by the MSDP peer in response to an SA request message. SA response messages contain the IP address of the originating RP and one or more (S, G) pairs of the active sources in the originating RP’s domain that are stored in the cache -> Answer D is not correct as it should be “SA response messages are used to
 advertise active sources in a domain” (not MSDP messages).

 Reference: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/ipmulti_pim/configuration/xe-16/imc-pim-xe-16-  book/imc-msdp-im-pim-sim.html
  In fact, answer A is also correct according to this link: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-
  xml/ios/ipmulti_pim/configuration/xe-16/imc-pim-xe-16-book/imc-msdp-im-pim-sim.html
  “MSDP depends on BGP or multiprotocol BGP (MBGP) for interdomain operation. We recommended that you run MSDP on RPs sending to global multicast groups.”
 But we think answer C is the better choice because it answers the question “How is MSDP used ...”.
 Note:
 After a large PIM-SM network is divided into multiple PIM-SM domains, a mechanism is required to enable user hosts in a PIM-SM domain to receive multicast data from sources in another PIM-SM domain.
 Multicast Source Discovery Protocol (MSDP) provides such a mechanism. It interconnects multiple PIM-SM domains to implement inter-domain multicast. RPs in PIM-SM domains set up MSDP peer relationships. By sending Source Active (SA) messages, the MSDP peers send the (S, G) information from the RP to which the source registers to the RPs in another PIM-SM domain.
  Reference: https://support.huawei.com/enterprise/en/doc/EDOC1000027471?section=j009
  Note: A benefit of using MSDP to interconnect multiple PIM-SM domains is to allow a rendezvous point (RP) to dynamically discover active sources outside of its domain.

Question 447. 
Which new enhancement was implemented in Wi-Fi 6?
A. Wi-Fi Protected Access 3
B. 4096 Quadrature Amplitude Modulation Mode
C. Channel bonding
D. Uplink and Downlink Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access

Answer: D

Explanation
 Wi-Fi 6 brings several crucial wireless enhancements for IT administrators when compared to Wi-Fi 5. The first
 significant change is using 2.4 GHz. Wi-Fi 5 was limited to only using 5 GHz. While 5 GHz is a ‘cleaner’ band of RF, it
 doesn’t penetrate walls and 2.4 GHz and requires more battery life. For Wi-Fi driven IoT devices, 2.4 GHz will likely
 continue to be the band of choice for the foreseeable future.
 Another critical difference between the two standards is the use of Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access
  (OFDMA) and MU-MIMO. Wi-Fi 5 was limited to downlink only on MU-MIMO, where Wi-Fi 6 includes downlink and
   uplink. OFDMA, as referenced above, is also only available in Wi-Fi 6.

209.165.201.6	209.165.201.1	QM_IDLE	  101	    ACTIVE

After configurating an IPsec VPN, an engineer enters the show command to verify the ISAKMP SA status. What does the status show?

A. ISAKMP SA is authenticated and can be used for Quick Mode.
B. Peers have exchanged keys, but ISAKMP SA remains unauthenticated.
C. VPN peers agreed on parameters for the ISAKMP SA
D. ISAKMP SA has been created, but it has not continued to form.

Answer: C

Explanation
 The “show crypto isakmp sa” command displays all current Internet Key Exchange (IKE) security associations (SAs) at a peer.
 QM_IDLE state means this tunnel is UP and the IKE SA key exchange was successful (authenticated), but is idle and may be used for subsequent quick mode exchanges. It is in a quiescent state (QM)

B. SaltStack uses the Ansible agent on the box, whereas Ansible uses a Telnet server on the box
C. SaltStack is constructed with minion, whereas Ansible is constructed with YAML
D. SaltStack uses SSH to interact with Cisco devices, whereas Ansible uses an event bus

Answer: C

Explanation
 – Saltstack uses YAML (Python) same as Ansible.
 – Saltstack uses the push model for executing commands via the SSH protocol
 – Ansible only uses SSH, not Telnet.
 In SaltStack architecture, there is a core component called Salt-minion, which is a system that is being controlled by a Salt master.

Question 456. 
Which congestion queuing method on Cisco IOS based routers uses four static queues?
A. Priority
B. custom
C. weighted fair
D. low latency

Answer: A

Explanation
 Priority Queuing (PQ): This type of queuing places traffic into one of four queues. Each queue has a different level of priority, and higher-priority queues must be emptied before packets are emptied from lower-priority queues. This behavior can “starve out” lower- priority traffic.

R1, R2
Have crypto maps
Have isakmp policies
Have access lists

A network engineer must simplify the IPsec configuration by enabling IPsec over GRE using IPsec profiles. Which two configuration changes accomplish this? (Choose two).
A. Create an IPsec profile, associate the transform-set ACL, and apply the profile to the tunnel interface.
B. Apply the crypto map to the tunnel interface and change the tunnel mode to tunnel mode ipsec ipv4.
C. Remove all configuration related to crypto map from R1 and R2 and eliminate the ACL.
D. Create an IPsec profile, associate the transform-set, and apply the profile to the tunnel interface.
E. Remove the crypto map and modify the ACL to allow traffic between 10.10.0.0/24 to 10.20.0.0/24.

Answer: CD

Explanation
A is wrong, you don’t use a “transform-set ACL”
B is wrong. question states use IPsec profiles. Crypto maps was the old way of doing ipsec tunnels before profiles.
C is correct, need to remove crypto map config or it will cause some confusion if the tunnel profile is applied. Didn’t lab it up, but book references this.
D is correct, all you need to do is create a profile and associate the transform-set to this profile, then apply it to the tunnel. If no transform set was created you would have to create one.
E is wrong, i believe removing crypto map would cause the traffic to flow unencrypted over the tunnel. acl in this case is to match the interesting traffic to be encrypted. it’s denying it.

       "model":"Catalyst",
       "mac":"00:46:10:06:93:55",
      ]
     }
}

A. Option A
B. Option B
C. Option C
D. Option D

Answer: A

Explanation
A JSON script should start with “{” -> Only Option A and Option D are correct. But Option D is surely not correct as the “switch is written without closing quote. Also another error in Option D is: square bracket [ can only hold a group of values or objects, separated by comma. For example:

"sports": ["volley-ball","badminton"] -> This [] holds a group of values
or

"book": [
{
  "id": "01",
  "language": "Java",
  "edition": "third"
},
{
  "id": "02",
  "language": "C++",
  "edition": "second"
} -> This [] holds a group of objects
But in Option D we see square bracket holds key/value pair which is not correct. Therefore only Option A is correct.

The key fields for the VXLAN packet in each of the protocol headers are:

+ Outer MAC header (14 bytes with 4 bytes optional) – Contains the MAC address of the source VTEP and the MAC address of the next-hop router. Each router along the packet’s path rewrites this header so that the source address is the router’s MAC address and the destination address is the next-hop router’s MAC address.

+ Outer IP header (20 bytes)- Contains the IP addresses of the source and destination VTEPs.
+ (Outer) UDP header (8 bytes)- Contains source and destination UDP ports:
– Source UDP port: The VXLAN protocol repurposes this standard field in a UDP packet header. Instead of using this field for the source UDP port, the protocol uses it as a numeric identifier for the particular flow between VTEPs. The VXLAN standard does not define how this number is derived, but the source VTEP usually calculates it from a hash of some combination of fields from the inner Layer 2 packet and the Layer 3 or Layer 4 headers of the original frame.
– Destination UDP port: The VXLAN UDP port. The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) allocates port 4789 to VXLAN.

+ VXLAN header (8 bytes)- Contains the 24-bit VXLAN Network Identifiers (VNI).
+ Original Ethernet/L2 Frame – Contains the original Layer 2 Ethernet frame.

Note: In fact this question has two correct answer, which are: VXLAN network identifier and original Layer 2 VLAN ID. But we believe the first answer is better.

Question 30
Which function is performed by vSmart in the Cisco SD-WAN architecture?
A. redistribution between OMP and other routing protocols
B. facilitation of NAT detection and traversal
C. distribution of centralized policies 
D. execution of localized policies

Answer: C

Explanation
Answer A is not correct as it is the role of vEdges. But by default, vEdges do not automatically redistribute OMP routes into any legacy routing protocol. We must explicitly enable the redistribution for each particular local protocol on each vEdge router.

Answer B mentions about vBond while answer D mentions about vEdge.

Question 31
Refer to the exhibit.

R2
IP - 192.168.0.5/30
RID 10.0.0.5
Network Type BROADCAST
State DR, Priority 1
Timers - Hello 10, Dead 40, Wait 40
Neighbor Count 0

R3
IP - 192.168.0.6/29
RID 10.0.0.3
Network Type BROADCAST
State DR, Priority 1
Timers - Hello 10, Dead 40, Wait 40
Neighbor Count 0

Why does the OSPF neighborship fail between the two interfaces?
A. The IP subnet mask is not the same.
B. There is a mismatch in the OSPF interface network type.
C. The OSPF timers are different.
D. The MTU is not the same.

Answer: A

Explanation
OSPF forms neighbor relationship with other OSPF routers on the same segment by exchanging hello packets. The hello packets contain various parameters. Some of them should match between neighboring routers. These include:

+ Hello and Dead intervals
+ Area ID
+ Authentication type and password
+ Stub Area flag
+ Subnet ID and Subnet mask

In this question we see the subnet mask between two neighbors are not matched (/30 & /29) so the OSPF neighborship failed.

Question 32
Refer to the exhibit.

  172.16.250.0/30
R2==============R1
  172.16.250.4/30

C 172.16.0.0/16, 2 subnets
D 172.16.1.0/24 [110/7445] via 172.16.250.1 G0/0
                [110/7445] via 172.16.250.5 G0/4

Clients are reporting an issue with the voice traffic from the branch site to the central site. What is the cause of this issue?
A. The voice traffic is using the link with less available bandwidth
B. There is a high delay on the WAN links
C. There is a routing loop on the network
D. Traffic is load-balancing over both links, causing packets to arrive out of order

Answer: D

Explanation
From the traceroute output, we learn the second link (172.16.250.5) has greater latency than the first link (172.16.250.1) so the packets will arrive out of order when traffic is load-balancing over both links.

Note: Latency (also known as delay) refers to the time it takes a voice packet to reach its destination. Latency is measured in milliseconds (ms) (or thousandths of a second). Latency of 150ms or less (one-way) is generally acceptable. Latency greater than 150ms (again, one way) adversely affects the call quality experience.

SW1(config-access-map)# match ip address MATCH_ALL
SW1(config-access-map)# action forward

SW1(config)# vlan filter HOST-A-B vlan 10

A. Option A
B. Option B
C. Option C
D. Option D

Answer: A

Explanation
In this case we need to configure a VLAN access-map to deny HTTP traffic and apply it to VLAN 10. To do it, first create an access-list, by which interesting traffic will be matched. The principle of VLAN access-map config is similar to the route-map principle.

After this we’ll create a vlan access-map, which has two main parameters: action and match.
Match: by this parameter the interesting traffic is matched and here RACL or MAC ACL can be applied as well.
Action: what to do with matched traffic. Two main parameters exist: Drop and Forward. In case of Drop, matched traffic will be dropped, and in case of forward, matched traffic will be allowed.

A good reference and example can be found at https://www.networkstraining.com/vlan-access-map-example-configuration/

In this question, we have to permit both ACL because the matched traffic will be decided by the VLAN Access map below (forward or drop).

Question 34
Which virtualization component creates VMs and performs hardware abstraction that allows multiple VMs to run at the same time?
A. rkt
B. Docker
C. container 
D. hypervisor

Answer: D

Explanation
Hypervisors support the creation and management of virtual machines (VMs) by abstracting a computer’s software from its hardware.

Question 40
An SSID is configured and both clients can reach their gateways on the Layer 3 switch, but they cannot communicate with each other. Which action resolves this issue?
A. Set the P2P Blocking Action to Forward-UpStream.
B. Set the P2P Blocking Action to Disabled
C. Set the WMM Policy to Required.
D. Set the WMM Policy to Allowed.

Answer: B

Explanation
Wi-Fi Multimedia (WMM) is used to prioritize different types of traffic -> It cannot block traffic so it is not a problem of this question.

Peer to peer (P2P) blocking is applied to individual WLANs. You can have traffic bridged locally within the controller, dropped by the controller, or forwarded to the upstream VLAN.

Choose one of the following options from the P2P Blocking drop-down list:

+ Disabled – Disables peer-to-peer blocking and bridges traffic locally within the controller whenever possible.This is the default value.
Note: Traffic is never bridged across VLANs in the controller.
+ Drop – Causes the controller to discard the packets.
+ Forward-UpStream – Causes the packets to be forwarded on the upstream VLAN. The device above the controller decides what action to take regarding the packets.

Reference: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/wireless/controller/7-5/configuration-guide/b_cg75/b_cg75_chapter_01001011.pdf

-> In this question two laptops are in the same VLAN so answer A is not correct. Only answer B is correct.

Question 43
Where is the wireless LAN controller located in a mobility express deployment?
A. There is no wireless LAN controller in the network.
B. The wireless LAN controller is embedded into the access point.
C. The wireless LAN controller exists in the cloud.
D. The wireless LAN controller exists in a server that is dedicated for this purpose.

Answer: B

Explanation
Mobility Express is the ability to use an access point (AP) as a controller instead of a real WLAN controller. But this solution is only suitable for small to midsize, or multi-site branch locations where you might not want to invest in a dedicated WLC. A Mobility Express WLC can support up to 100 APs.

Question 44
What is a characteristic of VXLAN?
A. It uses TCP for transport.
B. It has a 12-byte packet header.
C. It extends Layer 2 and Layer 3 overlay networks over a Layer 2 underlay.
D. It is a multi-tenant solution.

Answer: D

Explanation
VXLAN header consists of 8 bytes and contains the 24-bit VNI -> Answer B is not correct.

VXLAN uses UDP, not TCP -> Answer A is not correct.

VXLAN is often described as an overlay technology because it allows to stretch Layer 2 connections over an intervening Layer 3 network -> Answer C is not correct.

Therefore only answer D is left.

Question 48
Which capability does a distributed virtual switch have?
A. use floating static routes
B. provide configuration consistency across the hosts
C. run dynamic routing protocols
D. use advanced IPsec encryption algorithms

Answer: B

Explanation
Virtual switches are used to connect virtual network controllers of VMs to networks on the second layer of the OSI model.

Standard vSwitches are configured on each ESXi host manually. However, in large virtual environments, virtual switches usually have the same vSwitch configuration, including for port groups, VLANs, connected networks, etc. If you need to add a new port group associated with VLAN to connect VMs on ESXi hosts to that VLAN, you have to configure vSwitch on each ESXi host the same way manually. This is a time-consuming process.

To address this, VMware allows you to use the distributed virtual switch, a logical switch that can be configured on vCenter Server once for several hosts. This means that you don’t have to configure standard virtual switches on each ESXi host manually.

What is a benefit of using segmentation with TrustSec?
A. Integrity checks prevent data from being modified in transit.
B. Packets sent between endpoints on a LAN are encrypted using symmetric key cryptography.
C. Security group tags enable network segmentation.
D. Firewall rules are streamlined by using business-level profiles.

Answer: C

Explanation
Benefits of Segmentation with TrustSec

Security Group Tagging transforms segmentation by simplifying administration:
+ Security group tags allow organizations to segment their networks without having to redesign to accommodate more VLANs and subnets.
+ Firewall rules are dramatically streamlined by using an intuitive business-level profile method.
+ Policy enforcement is automated, assisting compliance and increasing security efficacy.
+ Security auditing becomes much easier, as Qualified Security Assessors can more easily validate that rules are being enforced to meet compliance.

Question 62A
Drag and drop the characteristic from the left onto the orchestration tools that they describe on the right.
Which of the following are about Ansible? (Choose two)
A. Uses playbooks
B. Uses a pull model
C. Procedural
D. Declarative

Answer: AC

Explanation
Ansible:
+ uses playbooks
+ prodedural

Puppet:
+ uses a pull model
+ declarative

In Ansible, Playbooks are files that provide actions and logic about what Ansible should do. Ansible playbooks are files that contain tasks to configure hosts. Ansible playbooks are written in YAML format.

Puppet is based on a Pull deployment model, where the nodes check in regularly after every 1800 seconds with the Master to see if anything needs to be updated in the agent. If anything needs to be updated the agent pulls the necessary Puppet codes from the Master and performs required actions.

Chef and Ansible encourage a procedural style where you write code that specifies, step-by-step, how to to achieve some desired end state. Terraform, SaltStack, and Puppet all encourage a more declarative style where you write code that specifies your desired end state, and the IAC tool itself is responsible for figuring out how to achieve that state.

Authentication servers - Enabled, none set
Accounting servers - Enable, none set
EAP Parameters - Disabled
RADIUS Interim Update - Enabled
Local EAP Auth - Disabled

An engineer must configure a Cisco WLC with WPA2 Enterprise mode and avoid global server lists. Which action is required?
A. Select a RADIUS authentication server
B. Disable the RADIUS server accounting interim update
C. Enable EAP parameters
D. Apply CISCO ISE default settings

Answer: A

Explanation
The “interim update” option is intended to periodically send the accounting data to the RADIUS server (e.g every 60 seconds) -> Answer B is not correct.

If we scroll up a bit in the “AAA Servers” tab, we will see the message “Select AAA servers below to override use of default servers on this WLAN” so we can choose the AAA server in the boxes to avoid default/global server lists -> Answer A is correct.

Question 67
An engineer must configure a multicast UDP jitter operation. Which configuration should be applied?
A. Router(config)#ip sla 1
Router(config)#udp jitter 10.0.0.1 source-ip 192.168.1.1
B. Router(config)#ip sla 1
Router(config)#udp-jitter 192.0.2.115 65051 num-packets 20
C. Router(config)#ip sla 1
Router(config)#udp-jitter 192.0.2.115 65051
D. Router(config)#ip sla 1
Router(config)#udp jitter 239.1.1.1 65051 end-point list List source-ip 192.168.1.1

Answer: D

Explanation
The command “udp jitter 239.1.1.1 65051 end-point list List source-ip 192.168.1.1” configures the IP SLAs operation as a multicast UDP jitter operation and enters multicast UDP jitter configuration mode.

Reference: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/ipsla/configuration/15-mt/sla-15-mt-book/sla_mcast_suppt.html

Note: In fact the correct command should be “Router(config-ip-sla)# udp-jitter 239.1.1.1 65051 endpoint-list List source-ip 192.168.1.1”. Maybe they are unintended typos of this question.

  print(f"Aborting; received status code {Response.status_code}") 
  exit ()

<...removed...>

admin@linux:~$ ./fetch.py 
Aborting; received status code 401

An administrator writes a script to fetch the list of devices that are registered with Cisco DNA Center. Why does the execution abort?

A. The “dna-center” hostname cannot be resolved to an IP address
B. The username or the password is incorrect
C. The TLS certificate of DNA Center is invalid
D. The authentication URL is incorrect

Answer: B

Explanation
From the last line, we see the returned code was 401.

The 401 Unauthorized Error is an HTTP status code error that represented the request sent by the client to the server that lacks valid authentication credentials. It may be represented as 401 Unauthorized, Authorization required, HTTP error 401- Unauthorized. It represents that the request could not be authenticated.

Question 76
When is GLBP preferred over HSRP?
A. When encrypted helm are required between gateways h a single group
B. When the traffic load needs to be shared between multiple gateways using a single virtual IP
C. When the gateway routers are a mix of Cisco and non-Cisco routers
D. When clients need the gateway MAC address lo Be the same between multiple gateways

Answer: B

Explanation
An advantage of GLBP over HSRP, VRRP is GLBP can load-balance traffic without any trick.

Question 77
A network engineer wants to configure console access to a router without using AAA so that the privileged exec mode is entered directly after a user provide the correct login credentials. Which action achieves this goal?
A. Configure login authentication privileged on line con 0
B. Configure a local username with privilege level 15
C. Configure privilege level 15 on line con 0
D. Configure a RADIUS or TACACS+ server and use it to send the privilege level

Answer: C

Explanation
Putting the privilege-level 15 on the console is one way to work around the issue. And it works – as long as you are comfortable with the fact that everyone who logs in on the console will be immediately placed directly into privilege/enable mode.

Reference: https://community.cisco.com/t5/network-access-control/privileged-exec-at-line-con-0/td-p/1705892

We also tested both “login authentication privileged” and “privilege level 15” commands. Only the latter exists:

Question 91
Which two functions is an edge node responsible for? (Choose two)
A. provides multiple entry and exit points for fabric traffic
B. provides the default exit point for fabric traffic
C. provides the default entry point for fabric traffic
D. provides a host database that maps endpoint IDs to a current location
E. authenticates endpoints

Answer: AE

Explanation
From below reference, we learn that answer D is not correct as the Control node (not Edge node) is a simple Host Database that maps Endpoint IDs to a current Location, along with other attributes.

Also from below reference, we can see the functions of Edge Node (page 34):

Edge Node provides first-hop services for Users / Devices connected to a Fabric

+ Responsible for Identifying and Authenticating Endpoints (e.g. Static, 802.1X, Active Directory) -> Answer E is correct
+ Register specific Endpoint ID info (e.g. /32 or /128) with the Control-Plane Node(s)
+ Provide an Anycast L3 Gateway for the connected Endpoints (same IP address on all Edge nodes)
+ Performs encapsulation / de-encapsulation of data traffic to and from all connected Endpoints

Reference: https://www.ciscolive.com/c/dam/r/ciscolive/us/docs/2019/pdf/BRKCRS-2818.pdf

Also from above reference, we also learn Border Node is the “default” exit if no entry is available in Control-Plane (“Gateway of Last Resort” for any unknown destinations) -> Answer B and answer C are not correct.

Therefore only answer A is left.

Question 93
Which configuration filters out DOT1X messages in the format shown below from being sent toward Syslog server 10.15.20.33?

Nov 20 13:47:32.553: %DOT1X-5-FAIL: Authentication failed for client (e04f.438e.de4f) on Interface Gi1/0/1 AuditSessionID OAQB50A5000004543910739E

A. logging discriminator DOT1X facility drops DOT1X
logging host 10.15.20.33 discriminator DOT1X

B. logging discriminator DOT1X msg-body drops DOTX
logging host 10.15.20.33 discriminator DOTX

C. logging discriminator DOT1X mnemonics includes DOTX
logging host 10.15.20.33 discriminator DOT1X

D. logging discriminator DOT1X mnemonics includes DOT1X
logging host 10.15.20.33 discriminator DOTX

Answer: A

Explanation
The “logging discriminator DOT1X facility drops DOT1X” command creates a logging message filter that drops log messages with a specific facility of “DOT1X”.

Here’s a breakdown of the command:

+ logging discriminator DOT1X: This command creates a logging message discriminator named “DOT1X” which can be used to filter specific types of log messages.

+ facility drops DOT1X: This option tells the discriminator to drop log messages that have a facility of “DOT1X”. Facilities are used to group log messages based on the type of device or process that generated them.

Overall, this command creates a logging message filter that drops log messages with a facility of “DOT1X”. Any log messages that have this facility will not be saved to the router’s log buffer.

This command could be useful in situations where a large number of log messages are generated by the 802.1X authentication process and these messages are not required for troubleshooting or auditing purposes. By dropping these messages, the router’s log buffer can be conserved and the visibility of other log messages can be improved.

Question 98
Refer to the exhibit.

Coverage Hole Detection - Enabled
Aironet IE - Enabled
Layer 2 ACL - None
URL ACL - None
P2P Blocking - Disabled
MFP Client Protection - Optional
DTIM Period
a/n - 1
b/g/n - 1
NAC State - ISE NAC

An engineer is troubleshooting an issue with client devices triggering excessive power changes on APs in the 2.4 GHz band. Which action resolves this issue?
A. Disable Coverage Hole Detection
B. Disable Aironet IE
C. Set the 802.11 b/g/n DTIM interval to 0
D. Enable MFP Client Protection

Answer: A

Explanation
Coverage Hole Detection is a feature that detects areas with poor wireless coverage and may trigger power changes on APs to improve coverage. Disabling it would prevent the APs from making these adjustments, which could stabilize the power levels.

MFP Client Protection is used to protect against clients connecting to a rogue access point only -> Answer D is not correct.

From the exhibit, we see that DTIM Period ranges from 1 to 255 so we cannot set it to 0 -> Answer C is not correct.

“Aironet IE” option means “Aironet IE Extension”. This extension help clients choose the best access point. But it does not relate to our question.

Which two new security capabilities are introduced by using a next-generation firewall at the Internet edge? (Choose two)
A. DVPN
B. NAT
C. stateful packet inspection
D. application-level inspection
E. integrated intrusion prevention

Answer: DE

Explanation
Next-generation firewalls (NGFWs) are deep-packet inspection firewalls that move beyond port/protocol inspection and blocking to add application-level inspection, intrusion prevention, and bringing intelligence from outside the firewall.

Question 103
Why does the vBond orchestrator have a public IP?
A. to allow for global reachability from all WAN Edges in the Cisco SD-WAN and to facilitate NAT traversal
B. to provide access to Cisco Smart Licensing servers for license enablement
C. to enable vBond to learn the public IP of WAN Edge devices that are behind NAT gateways or in private address space
D. to facilitate downloading and distribution of operational and security patches

Answer: A

Explanation
SD-WAN Validator – This software-based component performs the initial authentication of WAN Edge devices and orchestrates SD-WAN Controller, Manager, and WAN Edge connectivity. It also has an important role in enabling the communication between devices that sit behind Network Address Translation (NAT).

Reference: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/solutions/CVD/SDWAN/cisco-sdwan-design-guide.html

The major components of the Cisco SD-WAN Validator are:

…

NAT traversal: The Cisco SD-WAN Validator facilitates the initial orchestration between edge routers and Cisco SD-WAN Controllers when one or both of them are behind NAT devices.

Reference: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/routers/sdwan/configuration/sdwan-xe-gs-book/system-overview.html

Note: Cisco SD-WAN has been rebranded to Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN. As part of this rebranding, the vManage name has been changed to SD-WAN Manager, the vSmart name has been changed to SD-WAN Controller, and the vBond name has been changed to SD-WAN Validator.


Question 3
A network engineer must configure the VTY lines on a router to achieve these results:

+ Remote access should be permitted only for secure protocols.
+ Only a password should be required for device authentication.
+ All idle EXEC sessions must be terminated in 60 minutes.

Which configuration should be applied?

Option A
line vty 0 15 
 login
 password Cisco123 
 transport input all 
 exec-timeout 60

Option B
line vty 0 15 
 password Cisco123 
 transport input ssh 
 exec-timeout 60

Option C
line vty 0 15 
 password Cisco123 
 transport input all 
 session-timeout 60

Option D
line vty 0 15
 password Cisco123 
 transport input telnet ssh 
 exec-timeout 60

A. Option A
B. Option B
C. Option C
D. Option D

Answer: B

Explanation
From the requirement “Remote access should be permitted only for secure protocols” we can immediately figure out only Option B is correct as it only allows SSH connection with the “transport input ssh” command.

Question 6
Refer to the exhibit.

R1
Track 26 interface S0/0.1 line-protocol
Int g0/0
Ip address 10.10.10.2 255.255.255.0
Standby 100 ip 10.10.10.1
Standby 100 priority 105
Standby 100 preempt
Standby 100 track 26

R2
Int g0/0
Ip address 10.10.10.3 255.255.255.0
Standby 100 ip 10.10.10.1

An engineer must modify the existing configuration so that R2 can take over as the primary router when serial interface 0/0.1 on R1 goes down. Which command must the engineer apply?
A. R2# standby 100 preempt
B. R2# standby 100 priority 100
C. R2# standby 100 track 26 decrement 10
D. R2# track 26 interface Serial0/0.1 line-protocol

Answer: A

Explanation
This is a tricky question as we cannot apply any command about “track 26” on R2 as it only decrease the HSRP priority on R2. We need the “standby 10o preempt” command to take over the primary router because R1 is tracking S0/0.1 interface already. When this interface goes down, R1’s HSRP priority will decrease by 10 which is smaller than that of R2.

Question 7
Refer to the exhibit.

from ncclient import manager

netconf_host = manager.connect(host='ios-xe-example.com',
				port=22,
				username='cisco',    
				password='cisco',
				hostkey_verify=False, 
				device_params={'name':'iosxe'})
print (netconf_host.get_config('running'))
netconf_host.close_session()

An engineer deploys a script to retrieve the running configuration from a NETCONF-capable Cisco IOS XE device that is configured with default settings. The script falls. Which configuration must be applied to retrieve the configuration using NETCONF?
A. print (netconf_host.get_config(‘show running’))
B. port=830
C. device_params={‘name’:’ ios-xe’})
D. hostkey_verify=True,

Answer: B

Explanation
Port 830 listens for NETCONF over SSH connections so we need to connect via this port, not port 22.

Question 10
A customer requires their wireless network to be fully functional, even if the wireless controller fails. Which wireless design supports these requirements?
A. FlexConnect
B. mesh
C. centralized
D. embedded

Answer: A

Explanation
FlexConnect, formerly known as Hybrid Remote Edge AP (H-REAP), mode: allows data traffic to be switched locally and not go back to the controller. The FlexConnect AP can perform standalone client authentication and switch VLAN traffic locally even when it’s disconnected to the WLC (Local Switched).

Question 12
Refer to the exhibit.

WLAN
Layer 2 Security - WPA + WPA2
Mac Filtering - Disabled
PMF - Disabled
WPA2 Policy - Enabled
Encryption - AES
Auth Key Mgmt - None
MPSK - Disabled
Fast Transition - Disabled

Which action must be taken to configure a WLAN for WPA2-AES with PSK and allow only 802.11r-capable clients to connect?
A. Enable Fast Transition and FT + PSK.
B. Enable Fast Transition and PSK
C. Change Fast Transition to Adaptive Enabled and enable FT +PSK.
D. Enable PSK and FT + PSK.

Answer: A

Explanation
Cisco created a proprietary method known as “Adaptive FT” to workaround the issue of incompatible Apple devices not being able to associate to 802.11r enabled WLANs -> Answer C is not correct.

“Pure mode” sets a hard requirement on the wireless network in that clients that connect must support Fast Transition. Clients that do not support Fast Transition will not be able to connect at all. For WPA2-PSK networks, select “FT + PSK”.

Note: Answer D is the “mixed mode”. For this mode, in the beacon/probe response sent out by the AP towards the client devices, both the non-FT 802.11x and FT 802.11x authentication methods are announced and the client can choose which one it wants to use.

ip nat inside source static 10.10.10.10 10.0.3.10

Which address type is 10.10.10.10 configured for?
A. outside global
B. inside global
C. outside local
D. inside local

Answer: D

Explanation
The syntax of this command is: Router(config)# ip nat inside source static [inside_local_address [inside_global_address].

Therefore the inside local IP address 10.10.10.10 will be translated to 10.0.3.10 when it is sent out from the router.

Question 14
Which function does a virtual switch provide?
A. RAID storage for virtual machines
B. connectivity between virtual machines
C. CPU context switching for multitasking between virtual machines
D. emulation of power for virtual machines

Answer: B

Explanation
Hypervisors provide virtual switch (vSwitch) that Virtual Machines (VMs) use to communicate with other VMs on the same host. The vSwitch may also be connected to the host’s physical NIC to allow VMs to get layer 2 access to the outside world.

Question 15
Refer to the exhibit.

Router(config)#ntp master
Router(config)#ntp source loopback 0

What is the result of the NTP configuration?
A. The router will use the address of loopback 0 to communicate with the NTP server.
B. The router will advertise but not listen to NTP broadcast packets.
C. The router will be used as an NTP authoritative server only if it synchronized with an outside source.
D. The router will be used as an NTP authoritative server, even if it is not synchronized with an outside source.

Answer: D

Explanation
To configure a Cisco device as an Authoritative NTP Server, use the ntp master [stratum] command. An Authoritative NTP Server can distribute time even when it is not synchronized to an existing time server.

Question 19

R2(config-applet)#action 5 cli command "no sh"
R2(config-applet)#action 6 cli command "end"
R2(config-applet)#exit

An engineer must create a manually triggered EEM applet to enable the R2 router interface and assign an IP address to it. What is required to complete this configuration?
A. R2(config-applet)#action 4 cli command “ip add 172.16.1.1 0.0.0.255”
B. R2(config)# event manager session cli username
C. R2(config-applet)# event oir
D. R2(config-applet)# event none sync yes

Answer: D

Explanation
If you want to manually run the EEM applet, use the “event none” command. “sync yes” means “run the commands synchronously”. In other words, “run each command and wait until it is executed then run the next one”.

Question 20
What is stateful switchover?
A. cluster protocol used to facilitate switch failover
B. mechanism to take control from a failed RP while maintaining connectivity
C. mechanism used to prevent routing protocol loops during an RP switchover
D. First Hop Redundancy Protocol for host gateway connectivity

Answer: B

Explanation
Stateful switchover (SSO) establishes one of the supervisor engines as active while the other supervisor engine is designated as standby, and then SSO synchronizes information between them. A switchover from the active to the redundant supervisor engine occurs when the active supervisor engine fails, or is removed from the switch, or is manually shut down for maintenance.

Question 25
Which two features are available only in next-generation firewalls? (Choose two)
A. virtual private network
B. deep packet inspection
C. stateful inspection
D. application awareness
E. packet filtering

Answer: BD

Explanation
NGFWs combine many of the capabilities of traditional firewalls — including packet filtering, network address translation (NAT) and port address translation (PAT), URL blocking, and virtual private networks (VPNs) — with quality of service (QoS) functionality and other features not found in traditional firewalls. These include intrusion prevention, SSL and SSH inspection, deep-packet inspection, and reputation-based malware detection, as well as application awareness.

  30 deny tcp host 10.0.0.5 any eq telnet (18 matches) 
  40 permit tcp any any eq telnet (31 matches)

Which result is achieved by the CoPP configuration?
A. Traffic that matches entry 10 of ACL 100 is always dropped.
B. Class-default traffic is dropped.
C. Traffic that matches entry 10 of ACL 100 is always allowed with a limited CIR.
D. Traffic that matches entry 10 of ACL 100 is always allowed.

Answer: D

Explanation
Packets that match a deny rule are excluded from that class and cascade to the next class (if one exists) for classification. This is in contrast to packets matching a permit rule, which are then included in that class and no further comparisons are performed. Let’s see an example:

ip access-list extended CoPP_Telnet
 deny tcp host 192.168.1.1 any eq telnet      ! Allow this traffic unconstrained
 permit tcp any any eq telnet                 ! Rate-limit this traffic
!
class-map Telnet_class
 match access-group name CoPP_Telnet
!
policy-map CoPP_Telnet_policy
 class Telnet_class
  police cir 8000
   conform-action transmit
   exceed-action drop
!
control-plane
 service-policy input CoPP_Telnet_policy
!
This CoPP allows host with source address of 192.168.1.1 to forward Telnet packets to the control plane without constraint while all remaining Telnet packets are policed at the specified rate. A strange thing here is we have to “deny” source 192.168.1.1 in the ACL so that it is excluded from “class-map Telnet_class”. It will be matched by the “class-default” which is implemented implicitly at the end of the policy-map. This default class will match all the traffic and allows them by default.

Question 32
Which function is performed by vSmart in the Cisco SD-WAN architecture?
A. redistribution between OMP and other routing protocols
B. facilitation of NAT detection and traversal
C. aggregation and distribution of VPN routing information
D. execution of localized policies

Answer: C

Explanation
Answer A is not correct as it is the role of vEdges. But by default, vEdges do not automatically redistribute OMP routes into any legacy routing protocol. We must explicitly enable the redistribution for each particular local protocol on each vEdge router.

Answer B mentions about vBond while answer D mentions about vEdge.

Question 35
An engineer must use flexible NetFlow on a group of switches. To prevent overloading of the flow collector, if the flow is idle for 20 seconds, the flow sample should be exported. Which command set should be applied?

Option A
flow record recordflow 
 exporter flowexport
 record recordflow
 cache timeout active 120 
 cache timeout inactive 20 
 cache type immediate

Option B
flow monitor monitorflow
 exporter flowexport
 record recordflow
 cache timeout active 120 
 cache timeout inactive 20 
 cache type immediate

Option C
flow monitor monitorflow 
 exporter recordflow 
 cache timeout active 20 
 cache timeout inactive 120 
 cache type permanent

Option D
flow record recordflow
 match ipv6 destination ip-address 
 match ipv6 source ip-address 
 match ipv6 protocol-type view 
 match interface input 
 match interface output 
 match transport destination-port 
 collect counter bytes long

A. Option A
B. Option B
C. Option C
D. Option D

Answer: B

Explanation
“if the flow is idle for 20 seconds, the flow sample should be exported” -> We need to use the “cache timeout inactive 20” command.

+ “cache type permanent”: This command specifies the permanent cache type. This type of cache never ages out any flows.

+ “cache type immediate”: This command specifies the immediate cache type. This type of cache will age out every record as soon as it is created, with the result that every flow contains just one packet.

-> Therefore we need to use the “cache type permanent” with the “cache timeout inactive 20” to age out a flow if it has not seen any activity for 20 seconds. Maybe there is a typo in this question as none of the answers has both commands. But Option B is the best answer as these commands are used in “flow monitor”, not “flow record”.

Question 36
When a branch location loses connectivity, which Cisco FlexConnect state rejects new users but allows existing users to function normally?
A. Authentication-Down / Switch-Local
B. Authentication-Down / Switching-Down
C. Authentication-Central / Switch-Local
B. Authentication-Local / Switch-Local

Answer: A

Explanation
authentication down, local switching—In this state, the WLAN rejects any new clients trying to authenticate, but it continues sending beacon and probe responses to keep existing clients alive. This state is valid only in standalone mode.

In a Cisco SD-Access environment, which function is performed by the border node?
A. Connect devices to the fabric domain.
B. Group endpoints into IP pools.
C. Provide reachability information to fabric endpoints.
D. Provide connectivity to traditional layer 3 networks.

Answer: D

Explanation
+ Fabric border node: This fabric device (for example, core layer device) connects external Layer 3 networks to the SDA fabric.

Question 43

Question 57
Refer to the exhibit.

Elevation
Two ovals

Azimuth
Circle

Which antenna emits this radiation pattern?
A. omnidirectional
B. RP-TNC
C. dish
D. Yagi

Answer: A

Explanation
These Omnidirectional antennas have a doughnut shaped radiation pattern and are ideal for connecting devices that are on the same plane and to either side of each other. These are commonly misused in in-building and mobile applications. In mobile applications, Omnidirectional Dipole Antennas fail to have the proper patterning needed in order to connect to a tower that is on a much higher elevation. In in-building applications, Omnidirectional Dipole Antennas fail specifically in point to multipoint deployments where the user can be standing directly underneath a transmitting antenna, and be in a dead zone.

Question 74
Which action is the vSmart controller responsible for in an SD-WAN deployment?
A. onboard vEdge nodes into the SD-WAN fabric
B. distribute security information for tunnel establishment between vEdge routers
C. manage, maintain, and gather configuration and status for nodes within the SD-WAN fabric
D. gather telemetry data from vEdge routers

Answer: B

Explanation
+ Orchestration plane (vBond) assists in securely onboarding the SD-WAN WAN Edge routers into the SD-WAN overlay (-> Therefore answer A mentioned about vBond). The vBond controller, or orchestrator, authenticates and authorizes the SD-WAN components onto the network. The vBond orchestrator takes an added responsibility to distribute the list of vSmart and vManage controller information to the WAN Edge routers. vBond is the only device in SD-WAN that requires a public IP address as it is the first point of contact and authentication for all SD-WAN components to join the SD-WAN fabric. All other components need to know the vBond IP or DNS information.

+ Management plane (vManage) is responsible for central configuration and monitoring. The vManage controller is the centralized network management system that provides a single pane of glass GUI interface to easily deploy, configure, monitor and troubleshoot all Cisco SD-WAN components in the network. (-> Answer C and answer D are about vManage)

+ Control plane (vSmart) builds and maintains the network topology and make decisions on the traffic flows. The vSmart controller disseminates control plane information between WAN Edge devices, implements control plane policies and distributes data plane policies to network devices for enforcement (-> Answer B is about vSmart)

Question 78
Which version of NetFlow does Cisco Threat Defense utilize to obtain visibility into the network?
A. NBAR2
B. IPFIX
C. 8
D. flexible

Request URL: https://www.cisco.com/libs/granite/csrf/token.json
Request Method: GET
Status Code: 403
Remote Address: 23.207.65.173:443
Referrer Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin

Why was the response code generated?
A. The resource was unreachable
B. Access was denied based on the user permissions.
C. The resource 15 no longer available on the server.
D. There is a conflict in the current state of the resource.

Answer: B

Explanation
Status code 403 means “Forbidden”, which means “access was denied” -> Answer B is correct.

For your information, Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is an HTTP mechanism that allows resource sharing from one origin to another origin securely.

Two URLs would be considered to be having different origins when they have different protocols, ports (if specified), or hosts.

For example, making a request from https://domain-a.com to https://domain-b.com/api-1 is considered cross-origin as they have different hostnames.

Internet browsers follow the same-origin policy and restrict cross-origin HTTP requests initiated from scripts. This means that a website is only allowed to make requests to the same origin unless the response from other origins includes the right CORS headers.

Question 83
An engineer must configure interface and sensor monitoring on a router. The NMS server is located in a trusted zone with IP address 10.15.2.19. Communication between the router and the NMS server must be encrypted and password-protected using the most secure algorithms. Access must be allowed only for the NMS server and with the minimum permission levels needed. Which configuration must the engineer apply?

Option A

  permit 10.15.2.19 0.0.0.0

 snmp-server view rw iso included

 snmp server view rw ifEntry included

snmp-server group nms v3 auth write rw access nms
 snmp server user user1 nms v3 auth des Password1 pri des Password123

Option D
ip access list standard nms 
  permit 10.15.2.19 255.255.255.255

 snmp server view ro cisco included

 snmp server view ro ifEntry included 

 snmp-server group nms v3 priv read ro access nms
  snmp server user user1 nms v3 auth 3des Password1 pri aes 192 Password123

A. Option A
B. Option B
C. Option C
D. Option D

Answer: B

Explanation
“The NMS server must be encrypted and password-protected using the most secure algorithms” -> Option A and Option C are not correct as they are using MD5 and DES (Data Encryption Standard).

Option D is not correct as the access-list must use the wildcard mask, not subnet mask in “permit 10.15.2.19 255.255.255.255” statement.

-> Only Option B is correct. Option B is also using SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm) and AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) which are the most secure algorithms so far.

Question 84

An engineer attempts to configure standby group 512 on interface GigabitEthernet0/1, but the configuration is not accepted. Which command resolves this problem?
A. standby version 2
B. standby 512 preempt
C. standby redirects
D. standby 512 priority 100

Answer: A

Explanation
The group number range is from 0 to 255 for HSRP version 1 and from 0 to 4095 for HSRP version 2 so we must change to version 2 to use group 512.

Question 86
Which mechanism does OAuth use to strengthen REST API security when compared to BasicAuth?
A. Token
B. SSL
C. Authentication
D. TLS

Answer: A

Explanation
Auth0 generates access tokens for API authorization scenarios, in JSON web token (JWT) format. The permissions represented by the access token, in OAuth terms, are known as scopes. When an application authenticates with Auth0, it specifies the scopes it wants. If those scopes are authorized by the user, then the access token will represent these authorized scopes.

The CPE router acts as a DHCP server for the locally attached LAN. After DHCP snooping is enabled on the switch where the DHCP clients are connected, clients are unable to obtain their configuration from the DHCP server. What is the cause of this issue?
A. The IP address of the DHCP server is in the excluded DHCP range.
B. The configuration of Gi0/1 is missing the ip helper-address 192.168.255.1 command.
C. The DHCP server drops DHCP packets carrying Option 82 and an empty relay agent IP address.
D. The excluded DHCP range contains the subnet address of the entire LAN network.

Answer: C

Explanation
To solve this problem, we can add the global command ip dhcp relay information trust-all on the DHCP server CPE. This will instruct CPE to accept DHCP requests with a zero giaddr.

The web server is configured to listen only to TCP port 8080 for all HTTP requests. Which command is required to allow Internet users to access the web server on HTTP port 80?
A. ip nat outside source static tcp 10.1.1.100 8080 10.1.1.100 80
B. ip nat inside source static tcp 10.1.1.100 80 10.1.1.100 8080
C. ip nat inside source static tcp 10.1.1.100 8080 10.1.1.100 80
D. ip nat outside source static tcp 10.1.1.100 80 10.1.1.100 8080

Answer: C

Explanation
From the Internet side, users request HTTP with port 80: Outside port is 80
This question said the web server only listens on port 8080: Inside port is 8080

The syntax of this command is “ip nat inside source static tcp {inside-ip} [inside-port] {outside-ip} [outside-port]” so answer A is correct.

The purpose of this command  is to translate packets on the inside interface with a source IP address of 10.1.1.100 and port 8080 to the IP address 10.1.1.100 with port 80. This also implies that any packet received on the outside interface with a destination address of 10.1.1.100:8080 has the destination translated to 10.1.1.100:80.

We can find the same scenario at: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/network-address-translation-nat/13772-12.html#toc-hId–907557791 where the internal web server is configured to listen to TCP port 8080.

Standby 10 ip 192.168.1.254

Which configuration causes the traffic from PC-1 to the internet to use the link between CoreSW-1 and CoreSW-2 when both switches are up?

A.CoreSW-2(config)# interface vlan 10
CoreSW-2(config-if)# standby 10 priority 100

B.CoreSW-1(config)# interface vlan 10
CoreSW-1(config-if)# standby 10 priority 90

C.CoreSW-2(config)# interface vlan 10
CoreSW-2(config-if)# standby 10 priority 110

D.CoreSW-1(config)# interface vlan 10
CoreSW-1(config-if)# standby 10 priority 100

Answer: C

Explanation
From the “show spanning-tree vlan 10” command on both switches, we learn that CoreSw-1 is the root bridge for VLAN 10 so all traffic in this VLAN must flow to it. Therefore we must make the CoreSw-2 the primary HSRP router so that traffic will be forwarded to CoreSw-1 before sending to the Internet -> We need to set the HSRP priority to a value that is higher than 100 on CoreSW-2.

Question 9
Which technology provides an overlay fabric to connect remote locations utilizing commodity data paths and improves network performance, boosts security and reduces costs?
A. SD-WAN

Branch 1
10.0.1.0/24

Branch 2
10.0.2.0/24

Central
10.0.101.0/24

Which two commands are required on router R1 to block FTP and allow all other traffic from the Branch 2 network? (Choose two)

Option A
interface GigabitEthernet0/0
ip address 10.0.0.1 255.255.255.0
ip access-group 101 out

Option B
interface Gigabitethernet0/0
ip address 10.0.101.1 255.255.255.0
ip access-group 101 in

Option C
access-list 101 deny tcp 10.0.2.0 0.0.0.255 host 10.0.101.3 eq ftp-data
access-list 101 permit ip any any

Option D

access-list 101 deny tcp 10.0.2.0 0.0.0.255 host 10.0.101.3 eq ftp-data
access-list 101 permit ip any any

Option E
access-list 101 deny tcp 10.0.2.0 0.0.0.255 host 10.0.101.3 eq ftp
access-list 101 permit ip any any

A. Option A
B. Option B
C. Option C
D. Option D
E. Option E

Answer: AD

Explanation
MAYBE????
Maybe something is wrong in this question as the direction of the ACL applied to Gi0/0 interface is not correct. All the ACL statements have 10.0.2.0/24 as the source address so we must apply the ACL on the inbound direction of the WAN interface or outbound direction of the LAN interface -> Both Option A and Option B are not correct but we have to choose either of them because three other Options are just ACL statements. We should choose to block the WAN interface as it is closer to the source -> Option A is better.

In the three Options left, Option D is the best choice as it totally blocks FTP connection.

Question 19
Which characteristic applies to a traditional WAN solution but not to a Cisco SD-WAN solution?

R1(config)# interface GigabitEthernet 0/1
R1(config)# ip pat inside

Option C

R1(config)# interface GigabitEthernet 0/0
R1(config)# ip pat inside

R1(config)# interface GigabitEthernet 0/1
R1(config)# ip pat outside

Option D

R1(config)# interface GigabitEthernet 0/0
R1(config-if)# ip nat inside

R1(config)# interface GigabitEthernet 0/1
R1(config-if)# ip nat outside

A. Option A
B. Option B
C. Option C
D. Option D

Answer: A

Explanation

The purpose of the command “ip nat inside source static tcp 192.168.10.17 192.168.27.42” is to translate packets on the inside interface with a source IP address of 192.168.10.17 to the IP address 192.168.27.42 -> Gi0/1 interface should be “ip nat inside” (not “pat”) -> Option A is correct.

Question 28
Which type of roaming event occurs when a client roams across multiple mobility groups?
A. Layer 1
B. Layer 7
C. Layer 3
D. Layer 2

Answer: C

Explanation
A Mobility Group is a collection of Wireless LAN Controllers (WLCs) that work together to provide seamless wireless roaming for clients. Each Mobility Group consists of one or more WLCs, and when a client roams from one Mobility Group to another, it’s called Inter-Mobility Group Roaming.

The controller supports seamless roaming across multiple mobility groups. During seamless roaming, the client maintains its IP address across all mobility groups. When a client crosses a mobility group boundary during a roam, the client is fully authenticated, but the IP address is maintained, and mobility tunneling is initiated for Layer 3 roaming.

Question 29
A Cisco administrator deploys a new wireless network but CAPWAP APs cannot communicate with the wireless controller IP connectivity in the network functions properly. Which action resolves the issue?
A. Open CAPWAP UDP port 12222 in the network firewall
B. Open CAPWAP UDP ports 5246 and 5247 in the network firewall
C. Enable the UDP Lite feature on the WLC.
D. Ensure that the controller is connected to a AAA server

Answer: B

Explanation
CAPWAP uses UDP ports 5246 (control channel) and 5247 (data channel) so we must open these ports first.

Question 30
Which technique is used to protect end user devices and data from unknown file behavior?
A. crypto file ransomware protection using a file hash calculation
B. file retrospection using continuous scan and analyses
C. file sandboxing using a protected environment to analyze and simulate the behavior of unknown files
D. phishing file quarantine using an internal environment to store attached files

Answer: C

Explanation

Question 31
A client requests a wireless solution for remote branch offices to eliminate the need for a local controller at each branch. The branch users require local termination in a specific VLAN for local internet breakout. Which solution must be deployed?
A. central switched
B. FlexConnect local switching
C. auto-anchor mobility
D. asymmetric tunneling

Answer: B

Explanation
+ FlexConnect mode, formerly known as Hybrid Remote Edge AP (H-REAP), mode: allows data traffic to be switched locally and not go back to the controller if the CAPWAP to the WLC is down. The FlexConnect AP can perform standalone client authentication and switch VLAN traffic locally even when it’s disconnected to the WLC (Local Switched). FlexConnect AP can also tunnel (via CAPWAP) both user wireless data and control traffic to a centralized WLC (Central Switched). The AP can locally switch traffic between a VLAN and SSID when the CAPWAP tunnel to the WLC is down.

Question 44
How does a WLC achieve stateful switchover for APs and clients?
A. The active WLC establishes a CAPWAP tunnel to the AP, and the standby WLC establishes a LWAPP tunnel to the AP
B. The active WLC establishes a CAPWAP tunnel with the AP, and the standby WLC copies the AP database and the client database from the active WLC
C. The active WLC establishes a CAPWAP tunnel with the AP and standby WLC to share the AP database information
D. The active and standby WLCs establish separate CAPWAP tunnels to the AP

Answer: B

Explanation
This guide provides information on the theory of operation and configuration for the Cisco Unified Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) as it pertains to supporting stateful switchover of access points and clients (AP and Client SSO).

The new High Availability (HA) feature (that is, AP SSO) set within the Cisco Unified Wireless Network software release version 8.0 and above allows the access point (AP) to establish a CAPWAP tunnel with the Active WLC and share a mirror copy of the AP database with the Standby WLC. The APs do not go into the Discovery state when the Active WLC fails and the Standby WLC takes over the network as the Active WLC.

There is only one CAPWAP tunnel maintained at a time between the APs and the WLC that is in an Active state.

Reference: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/wireless/controller/technotes/8-7/High_Availability_DG.html

Note: The underlined sentence is a bit unclear. It should say “… the Active WLC shares a mirror copy of the AP database with the Standby WLC”.

What is the purpose of the configuration?
A. The router will function in NTP in client mode
B. The router will use 172.16.1.1 as the source for NTP packets
C. The router is allowed to receive NTP broadcast packets
D. The router will function as an authoritative NTP server

Answer: D

Explanation
The “ntp source …” command allows you to define the interface to be used as the source interface for generating NTP traffic. By default, the router normally uses the interface closest to the destination as the source interface.

With the ntp master [stratum] command, this device is configured as an Authoritative NTP Server.

A. aaa authorization exec default group radius none
B. aaa authentication login default group radius local none
C. aaa authorization exec default group radius
D. aaa authorization exec default group radius if-authenticated

Answer: D

Explanation
Let’s see the command “aaa authorization exec default group radius if-authenticated”. Notice the “if-authenticated” keyword at the end of this line. This is saying that if we are authenticated we will immediately be dropped into exec (enable) mode.

Question 60
Which mechanism can be used to enforce network access authentication against an AAA server if the endpoint does not support the 802.1X supplicant functionality?
A. private VLANs
B. port security
C. MAC Authentication Bypass
D. MACsec

Answer: C

Explanation
802.1x is a great way to protect your network by authenticating everything you connect to your switch ports, However, one disadvantage of 802.1X is that your end devices have to support it. If you can’t use 802.1X but still want to secure your switch ports somehow, you can use MAC Authentication Bypass (MAB).

When you enable MAB on a switchport, the switch drops all frames except for the first frame to learn the MAC address. Pretty much any frame can be used to learn the MAC address except for CDP, LLDP, STP, and DTP traffic. Once the switch has learned the MAC address, it contacts an authentication server (RADIUS) to check if it permits the MAC address.

Question 66
A wireless network engineer must configure a WPA2+WPA3 policy with the Personal security type. Which action meets this requirement?
A. Configure the GCMP256 encryption cipher.
B. Configure the CCMP256 encryption cipher.
C. Configure the CCMP128 encryption cipher.
D. Configure the GCMP128 encryption cipher.

Answer: C

Explanation
CCMP (Counter/CBC-MAC Protocol)

The Counter/CBC-MAC Protocol (CCMP) is considered more secure than TKIP. CCMP consists of two algorithms:

+ AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) counter mode encryption.
+ Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code (CBC-MAQ used as a message integrity check (MIC).

The WPA3 Personal stills support AES. WPA3 uses AES-128 for message encryption in Personal and 192 bits in Enterprise

Devices that support CCMP have the WPA2 designation.

Note:

GCMP (Galois/Counter Mode Protocol)

The Galois/Counter Mode Protocol (GCMP) is a cryptographic protocol that provides confidentiality and integrity for data in wireless networks. It is used in the IEEE 802.11 i standard for wireless security, and is also supported by some other wireless networking standards.

GCMP is an authenticated encryption suite that is more secure and more efficient than CCMP. GCMP consists of two algorithms:

+ AES counter mode encryption.
+ Galois Message Authentication Code (GMAQ used as a message integrity check (MIC).

GCMP is used in WPA3.

Question 69A
Drag and drop the characteristics from the left onto the corresponding switching architectures on the right.
Which of these are characteristics of the RIB? (Choose two)
A. It is known as CEF
B. It is used to make destination prefix-based switching decisions
C. Each routing protocol has its own information base
D. It is built form information obtained form dynamic routing protocols and connected and static routes

Answer: CD

Explanation
RIB:
+ Each routing protocol has its own information base
+ It is built from information obtained from dynamic routing protocols and connected and static routes

FIB:
+ It is known as CEF
+ It is used to make destination prefix-based switching decision

Each routing protocol like OSPF, EIGRP has its own Routing information base (RIB) and they select their best candidates to try to install to global RIB so that it can then be selected for forwarding. In order to view the RIB table, use the command “show ip ospf database” for OSPF, “show ip eigrp topology” for EIGRP or “show ip bgp” for BGP. To view the Forwarding Information Base (FIB), use the “show ip cef” command. RIB is in Control plane while FIB is in Data plane.

The Forwarding Information Base (FIB) contains destination reachability information as well as next hop information. This information is then used by the router to make forwarding decisions. The FIB allows for very efficient and easy lookups. Below is an example of the FIB table:

The FIB maintains next-hop address information based on the information in the IP routing table (RIB). In other words, FIB is a mirror copy of RIB.

RIB is in Control plane (and it is not used for forwarding) while FIB is in Data plane (and it is used for forwarding).

Question 81
Which encoding is used to protect a username and login with RESTful API basic authentication?
A. Type-7
B. SHA-1
C. MD5
D. Base64

Answer: D

Explanation
Basic authentication is a simple authentication scheme built into the HTTP protocol. The client sends HTTP requests with the “Authorization” header containing the word “Basic”, a space character, and a “username:password” string encoded in Base64.

For example, to authorize the user “demo” with password “p@55w0rd” the client sends:

Authorization: Basic ZGVtbzpwQDU1dzByZA==
In this example, the ZGVtbzpwQDU1dzByZA== string results from encoding the string demo:p@55w0rd in Base64.

json_file.write(encoded_json_indented)

A. dumps
B. loads
C. open
D. read
E. load
F. write

Answer: DBAF

Explanation
1. read
2. loads
3. dumps
4. write
Although we can use “load” method (for the first blank box) to read a file object and parse it at the same time but it requires a parameter so we cannot use it at the first blank box (at 3rd line). For example, we can use “load” with this:

with open("json_ios_xe.json", "r") as json_file:
    json_file_content = json_file.load(json_file)
Therefore in this question we must use “read” instead at the first blank box then parse it later at the second blank box with “loads”.

Good reference: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/loading-a-json-file-in-python-how-to-read-and-parse-json/

json.dumps() takes a JSON object and returns a string.

R4(config-router)# bgp default local-preference 300

R5(config)# router bgp 65020
R5(config-router)# bgp default local-preference 200

B. R2(config)# router bgp 65010
R2(config-router)# bgp default local-preference 300

R1(config)# router bgp 65010
R1(config-router)# bgp default local-preference 200

C. R2(config)# router bgp 65010
R2(config-router)# bgp default local-preference 200

R1(config)# router bgp 65010
R1(config-router)# bgp default local-preference 300

D. R4(config)# router bgp 65020
R4(config-router)# bgp default local-preference 200

R5(config)# router bgp 65020
R5(config-router)# bgp default local-preference 300

Answer: B

Explanation
We can use local preference attribute to influence the decision of iBGP neighbor to choose the path to external BGP neighbors:

In this question we need to configure higher local preference value on R2 than on R1.

Question 88
Drag and drop the code snippets from the bottom onto the blanks in the Python script to convert a Python object into a JSON string. Not all options are used.

import ____________

data = {
...
}

model = data["devices"][0]["model"]

json_string = ________________(data)

print(______________)

A. json.dumps
B. json
C. json_string
D. json.loads

Answer: BAC

Explanation
1. json
2. json.dumps
3. json_string

The json.dumps() function is used to convert Python objects (dictionary, list, string, integer, boolean… type) into JSON strings. Here’s a simple example:

import json
data = {'name': 'John', 'age': 25} #Define a Python dictionary
json_data = json.dumps(data) #Use json.dumps() to convert the dictionary into a JSON string
print(json_data) #Output: '{"name": "John", "age": 25}'

An engines configured TACACS+ to authenticate remote users but the configuration is not working as expected. Which configuration must be applied to enable access?
A. R1(config)#ip tacacs source-interface Gig0/0
B. R1(config)#tacacs-server prod
R1(config-server-tacacs)#key cisco123
C. R1(config)#aaa authorization exec default group tacacs+ local
D. R1(config)#tacacs-server prod
R1(config-server-tacacs)#port 1020

Answer: B

Explanation
From the output, we see the last line is “Invalid AUTHEN packet (check keys)” so surely the key was not matched.

Question 98
Which access control feature does MAB provide?
A. user access based on IP address
B. allows devices to bypass authenticate
C. network access based on the physical address of a device
D. simultaneous user and device authentication

Answer: C

Explanation
Standalone MAC Authentication Bypass (MAB) is an authentication method that grants network access to specific MAC addresses regardless of 802.1X capability or credentials. As a result, devices such as cash registers, fax machines, and printers can be readily authenticated, and network features that are based on authorization policies can be made available.

Question 2
What is a characteristic of traffic shaping?
A. drops out-of-profile packets
B. can be applied in both traffic directions
C. queues out-of-profile packets until the buffer is full
D. causes TCP retransmits when packets are dropped

Answer: C

Explanation
Traffic shaping can be applied to outgoing direction only. Traffic shaping queues excess traffic by holding packets inside a shaping queue (buffer) -> Answer C is correct.

Note: The portion of the traffic that causes the flow to exceed its QoS limit is referred to as out‑of‑profile packets.

Question 3
Why would an architect use an OSPF virtual link?
A. to merge two existing Area 0s through a nonbackbone
B. to allow a stub area to transit another stub area
C. to connect a nonbackbone area to Area 0 through another nonbackbone area
D. to connect two networks that have overlapping private IP address space

Answer: C

Explanation
In fact there are two correct answers here:

All areas in an Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) autonomous system must be physically connected to the backbone area (Area 0). In some cases, where this is not possible, you can use a virtual link to connect to the backbone through a non-backbone area (-> Answer C is correct). You can also use virtual links to connect two parts of a partitioned backbone through a non-backbone area (-> Answer A is correct).

Reference: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/open-shortest-path-first-ospf/47866-ospfdb7.html

But if we have to choose one then answer C is better as it is used more popularly than answer A.

Question 13
Drag and drop the code snippets from the bottom onto the blanks in the script to convert a Python object into a JSON string. Not all options are used.

Import json

Data = {
...
}

Obj = json._____________()._______________(_____________)

A. data
B. JSONEncoder
C. encode
D. decode
E. JSONDecoder

Answer: BCA

Explanation
1. JSONEncoder
2. encode
3. data
JSONEncoder class is used for serialization of any Python object while performing encoding. It contains three different methods of encoding which are:
+ default(obj) – Implemented in the subclass and return serialize object for o object.
+ encode(obj) – Same as JSON dumps Python method return JSON string of Python data structure.
+ iterencode(obj) – Represent string one by one and encode object.


Question 15
Refer to the exhibit.

SW1
monitor session 1 type rpsan-dest
source remote vlan 50
dest int gig0/1

SW2
monitor session 1 type rpsan-source
source vlan 60
dest remote vlan 50

An engineer must send the 172.16.2.0/24 user traffic to a packet capture tool to troubleshoot an issue. Which action completes the configuration?
A. Disable the spanning tree protocol on the monitoring server VLAN.
B. Enable the Cisco Discovery Protocol on the server interfaces.
C. Encrypt the traffic between the users and the monitoring servers.
D. Define the remote span VLAN on SW1 and SW2.

Answer: D

Explanation
We need to define the remote span VLAN on both switches as well:

SW1(config)#vlan 50
SW1(config-vlan)#remote-span

SW2(config)#vlan 50
SW2(config-vlan)#remote-span
Note: In this question, SW2 captures all VLAN 60 traffic and send them to SW1 via VLAN 50.

Question 16
What is one characteristic of Cisco DNA Center and vManage northbound APIs?
A. They push configuration changes down to devices.
B. They implement the RESTCONF protocol.
C. They exchange XML-formatted content.
D. They implement the NETCONF protocol.

Answer: C

Explanation
Answer A answer B and answer D are not correct as they are characteristics of southbound APIs, not northbound.

Answer C is the best choice as both DNA Center and vManage use REST APIs, which can use XML or JSON as data formats for exchanging information between the client and the server.

Question 17
High bandwidth utilization is occurring on interface Gig0/1 of a router. An engineer must identify the flows that are consuming the most bandwidth. Cisco DNA Center is used as a flow exporter and is configured with the IP address 192.168.23.1 and UDP port 23000. Which configuration must be applied to set NetFlow data export and capture on the router?

Option A
R1(config)# ip flow-export
R1(config)# ip flow-export destination 192.168.23.1 23000
R1(config)# interface Gig0/1
R1(config-if)# ip flow monitor

Option B
R1(config)# ip flow-export
R1(config)# ip flow-export destination 192.168.23.1
R1 (config)# interface Gig0/1
R1(config-if)# collect counter bytes
R1(config-if)# collect counter packets

Option C
R1(config)# ip flow-export version 9
R1(config)# ip flow-export destination 192.168.23.1 23000
R1(config)# interface Gig0/1
R1(config-if)# ip flow ingress
R1(config-if)# ip flow egress

Option D
R1(config)# ip flow-export version 9
R1(config)# ip flow-export destination 192.168.23.1 23000
R1(config)# interface Gig0/1
R1(config-if)# ip flow-top-talkers

A. Option A
B. Option B
C. Option C
D. Option D

Answer: C

Explanation
The default UDP port is 2055 but we need port 23000 in this question so we have to manually configure it with “ip flow-export destination 192.168.23.1 23000” command. Also the “collect counter bytes” & “collect counter packets” must be placed under flow record, not under interface mode -> Option B is not correct.

The syntax of “ip flow monitor …” command is ip flow monitor {monitor_name} -> Option A is not correct.

The “top talkers” feature must be configured under global configuration mode, not interface mode -> Option D is not correct.

-> Only Option C is left.

Question 18

A network engineer must use a Python script to convert data received from a network device. Which type of data is printed to the console when the script runs?
A. dictionary with a key-value pair
B. list of strings
C. tuple list
D. list of lists

Answer: A

Explanation
We created initial variables to test this script and print the type of the result:

The type of the result is “dictionary”.

Code explanation:

line.split("=>"): This part splits the input string line into a list of substrings using the “=>” delimiter. For example, if line is “vlan1 => 10”, line.split("=>") would produce ['vlan1 ', ' 10'].

[word.strip() for word in line.split("=>")]: This is a list comprehension that iterates over each element in the list obtained from the previous step (line.split("=>")). For each element word, the strip() method is applied to remove leading and trailing whitespace. This results in a new list of cleaned-up strings.

k, v = [word.strip() for word in line.split("=>")]: This unpacks the two elements of the list into the variables k and v. In the example of “vlan1 => 10”, after this line of code, k would be assigned the value “vlan1” (with leading and trailing spaces removed), and v would be assigned the value “10” (with leading and trailing spaces removed).

In summary, this line of code is used to extract key-value pairs from a string by splitting it based on the “=>” delimiter and removing any extra whitespace around the keys and values.

Question 23
An engineer creates the configuration below. Drag and drop the authentication methods from the left into the order of priority on the right. Not all options are used.

R1#sh run | i aaa
aaa new-model
aaa authentication login default group ACE group AAA_RADIUS local-case
aaa session-id common
R1#

Put each login method in the correct order. Use all four.
A. AAA_RADIUS group
B. Deny
C. ACE group
D. local

Answer: CADB

Explanation
The “aaa authentication login default group ACE group AAA_RADIUS local-case” command is broken down as follows:

+ The ‘aaa authentication’ part is simply saying we want to configure authentication settings.
+ The ‘login’ is stating that we want to prompt for a username/password when a connection is made to the device.
+ The ‘default’ means we want to apply for all login connections (such as tty, vty, console and aux). If we use this keyword, we don’t need to configure anything else under tty, vty and aux lines. If we don’t use this keyword then we have to specify which line(s) we want to apply the authentication feature.
+ The ‘group ACE group AAA_RADIUS” means all users are authenticated using group ACE (the first method). If the credentials are not found on this group, then the group AAA_RADIUS is used (the second method).
+ The ‘local-case‘ option uses case-sensitive local usernames.

Question 26
An engineer must save the configuration of router R2 using the NETCONF protocol. Which script must be used?

Option A
<?xml version=1 encoding= utf-8?>

Question 29
What is the result of this python program (3*5)%2?
A. 7
B. 7.5
C. 0
D. 1

Answer: D

Explanation
This question is missing a number after “%”. From the answers, we believe the number after “%” is 2 so the full question is (3*5)%2 so the result is 1.

Note: The % symbol in Python is called the Modulo Operator. It returns the remainder of dividing the left hand operand by right hand operand. It’s used to get the remainder of a division problem.

Question 30
How are control traffic, client authentication and data traffic handled in a mobility express environment?
A. Control traffic and client authentication is handled centrally by the controller. Data traffic is switched centrally by the controller.
B. Control traffic and client authentication is handled centrally by the controller. Data traffic is switched locally by the access points.
C. Control traffic and client authentication is handled locally by each access point. Data traffic is switched locally by the access points.
D. Control traffic and client authentication is handled locally by each access point. Data traffic is switched centrally by the controller.

Answer: B

Explanation

Question 31
Which Cisco DNA Center Assurance feature verifies host reachability?
A. detail information
B. application experience
C. path trace
D. network time travel

Answer: C

Explanation
When you initiate a path trace, the Cisco DNA Center controller reviews and collects network topology and routing data from the discovered devices. It then uses this data to calculate a path between the two hosts or Layer 3 interfaces, and displays the path in a path trace topology. The topology includes the path direction and the devices along the path, including their IP addresses.

After unsuccessfully configuring an EtherChannel link, an engineer enables debugging. Which action will resolve the issue?
A. Set the EtherChannel to mode active.
B. Set the EtherChannel to mode on.
C. Configure the EtherChannel members in desirable mode.
D. Configure the EtherChannel members in passive mode.

Answer: C

Explanation
From the line “PAgP not enabled on agport Po2”, we can deduce PAgP has not been configured correctly on this Po2. So we should configure it in desirable mode.

An engineer must prevent VLAN 20 routes from appearing in the routing table of Switch-1. Which command set must be applied?

Option A
On Switch-2:
router ospf 1
distribute-list 1 in
access-list 1 deny 192.168.2.0 0.0.0.255

Option B
On Switch-2:
router ospf 1
distribute-list 1 out
access-list 1 permit 192.168.2.0 0.0.0.255

Option C
On Switch-1:
router ospf 1
distribute-list 1 out
access-list 1 deny 192.168.2.0 0.0.0.255

Option D
On Switch-1:
router ospf 1
distribute-list 1 in
access-list 1 deny 192.168.2.0 0.0.0.255

A. Option A
B. Option B
C. Option C
D. Option D

Answer: D

Explanation
There are two ways to prevent VLAN 20 routes from appearing in the routing table of Switch-1 with distribute-list:
+ Deny this route on Switch-1 inbound direction so Switch-1 will not learn about this route
+ Deny this route on Switch-2 outbound direction so Switch-2 will not advertise this route

-> We must use an access-list with a “deny” statement for 192.168.2.0/24 -> Only Option D is correct.

But there is a mistake in this question as we must allow other prefixes (routes) to be learned with the “access-list 1 permit any” statement under above “deny” statement. Otherwise all other prefixes will be dropped as well.

Question 36
What is the purpose of data modeling languages?
A. to translate encoded data for interoperability between different CPU architectures
B. to describe a data schema convertible into any data encoding format
C. to specify algorithms necessary to decode binary-encoded protocol data units

Question 37
Refer to the exhibit.

Router(config)#clock timezone EST -5 0
Router(config)#clock summer-time EDT recurring
Router(config)#clock calendar-valid
Router(config)#ntp master
Router(config)#interface vlan 3
Router(config-if)#ntp broadcast

What are two results of the NTP configuration? (Choose two)
A. It distributes the time via NTP broadcast packets.
B. It distributes the time via NTP broadcast and multicast packets.
C. It uses other systems as an authoritative time source.
D. It uses the hardware clock as an authoritative time source.
E. It forms a peer association with another system.

Answer: AD

Explanation
The command “clock timezone EST -5 0” is used to set the time zone on a Cisco device. “EST” is the abbreviation for the “Eastern Standard Time” zone. “-5” value represents the time zone offset from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). In this example, it is set to -5 hours. If your time zone is ahead of UTC, you would use a positive value; if it’s behind, you use a negative value. The last parameter (0 in this case) represents whether or not daylight saving time (DST) is in effect. A value of 0 means that DST is not observed.

The command “clock summer-time EDT recurring” is used to configure daylight saving time (DST) on a Cisco device.

The command “clock calendar-valid” enables the router to act as a valid time source to which network peers can synchronize. By default, the time maintained on the software clock is not considered to be reliable and will not be synchronized with NTP or VINES time service -> Answer D is correct.

The command “ntp broadcast” enables the interface to send NTP broadcast packets to a peer. If we want to use multicast for NTP synchronization, we must use the “ntp multicast” command instead -> Answer C is correct while answer B is not correct.

With all of the above commands, the local router becomes an authoritative NTP server and broadcast NTP messages to NTP clients.

Question 38
Refer to the exhibit.

event manager applet Config
event cli pattern "config term" ___________
action 1.0 cli command "enable"

An engineer constructs an EEM applet to prevent anyone from entering configuration mode on a switch. Which snippet is required to complete the EEM applet?
A. sync yes skip yes
B. sync no skip yes
C. sync no skip no
D. sync yes skip no 

Answer: B

Explanation
When you use the “sync yes” option in the event cli command, the EEM applet runs before the CLI command is executed. The EEM applet should set the _exit_status variable to indicate whether the CLI command should be executed (_exit_status set to one) or not (_exit_status set to zero). But in this question we don’t use the _exit_status variable so we have to use the “syn no” option -> Only answer B and answer C are correct.

With the “sync no” option, the EEM applet is executed in background in parallel with the CLI command. As the CLI command starts at the same time as the EEM applet, you cannot use the _exit_status variable anymore; you have to specify whether you want the CLI command to execute with the skip yes|no option of the event cli command. In this question, we want to ignore the “configure terminal” command so we have to set the “skip yes” option -> Only answer B is correct.

Reference: https://blog.ipspace.net/2011/01/eem-event-cli-command-options-and.html

Question 39
What is a characteristic of vManage?
A. It leverages the overlay management protocol to interface with WAN Edge devices.
B. It uses NETCONF to configure vSmart devices to build the overlay network data plane.
C. It requires a public IP address to allow WAN Edge devices to discover fabric components.
D. It supports protocols such as OSPF to integrate with legacy network devices.

Answer: B

Explanation
Centralized policies are built using vManage, and then stored in its database. They are then sent via NETCONF to the vSmart controller to become a part of vSmart configurations.-> Answer B is correct.

The vSmart controller then uses Overlay Management Protocol (OMP) to send the policy parameters as updates in the routing protocol to all of the WAN edge devices -> Answer A is not correct.

network 172.27.206.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
network 172.24.206.0 0.0.0.255 area 0

Answer: D

Explanation
By using the correct and exact network and subnet masks, CR1 will not turn on OSPF on new interfaces and it cannot exchange OSPF with other network devices by other interfaces than Gi0/0 & Gi0/1.

In this question we should understand that these commands make sure CR1 cannot form OSPF neighbor relationship with other routers directly (on a new interface). If it is connected through a switch then surely it can form OSPF neighbor relationship. For example if we add a new router to SW3 in the 10.165.231.0/24 subnet then surely it will create OSPF neighbor relationshipo with CR1.

Answer “router ospf 1
network 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255 area 0
passive-interface GigabitEthernet0/2″

is not correct because if CR1 has a new interface then OSPF will also be turned on that interface.
Answer “interface Gi0/2
ip ospf 1 area 0
!
router ospf 1
passive-interface GigabitEthernet0/2″

is not correct as OSPF is not run on Gi0/1 and CR1 and CR3 cannot exchange OSPF information.

Question 44
Which configuration saves the running configuration to the startup configuration and logs a “saving configuration automatically” message when a syslog message that contains “SYS-5-CONFIG_I” is received’?

Option A
event manager applet saveconfig 
 event syslog pattern "SYS-5-CONFIG_I" period 1 
 event track 1 
 action 1.0 cli command "write mem" 
 action 2.0 syslog msg "saving configuration automatically"

Option B
event manager applet save_config
 action 1.0 string match "SYS-5-CONFIG_I" save_config
 action 2.0 cli command "write mem"
 action 3.0 syslog msg "saving configuration automatically"

Option C
event manager applet save_config
 event syslog pattern "SYS-5-CONFIG_I" period 1
 action 1.0 cli command "end"
 action 2.0 cli command "write mem
 action 3.0 syslog msg "saving configuration automatically"

Option D
event manager applet save_config
 event syslog pattern "SYS-5-CONFIG_I" period 1
 action 1.0 cli command "write mem"
 action 2.0 syslog msg "saving configuration automatically"

A. Option A
B. Option B
C. Option C
D. Option D 

Answer: D

Explanation
To use the “string match” keyword, we should use “?” and “*” to match the whole string or it will return false. For example we should use: action 1.0 string match “*SYS-5-CONFIG_I*” save_config

When we receive the pattern “SYS-5-CONFIG_I”, that means we have just configured something and exited configuration mode. In the example below, we will see the syslog “%SYS-5-CONFIG_I” message after exit the configuration mode:

-> Therefore we don’t need the “end” command -> Option D is correct.

Question 45
Which type of antenna is designed to provide a 360-degree radiation pattern?
A. Yagi
B. patch
C. directional
D. omnidirectional

Answer: D

An omnidirectional antenna is designed to provide a 360-degree radiation pattern. This type of antenna is used when coverage in all directions from the antenna is required.

Omnidirectional Antenna Radiation Pattern

Question 46
Refer to the exhibit.

Channel Assignment - Auto
Avoid Foreign AP interference - Enabled
Avoid Cisco AP load - Disabled
Avoid non-802.11a noise - Enabled
Avoid Persistent Non-Wifi Interference - Disabled
DCA Channel Sensitivity - Medium
Channel Width - 40 MHz
EDRRM - Disabled

An engineer is troubleshooting an issue with non-Wi-Fi interference on the 5-GHz band. The engineer has enabled Cisco CleanAir and set the appropriate traps, but the AP does not change the channel when it detects significant interference. Which action will resolve the issue?
A. Enable the Event Driven Radio Resource Management option
B. Change the DCA Sensitivity option to High
C. Enable the Avoid Persistent Non-WiFi interference option
D. Disable the Avoid Foreign AP Interference option

Answer: A

Explanation
DRRM is a feature that allows an access point that is in distress to bypass normal RRM intervals and immediately change channels. A CleanAir access point always monitors AQ and reports the AQ every 15 minutes. AQ only reports classified interference devices. The key benefit of EDRRM is fast action time.

A is correct

C works differently.
if the Persistent Device Avoidance function is enabled, the interference will be marked so that the access-points that have been affected by the interference do not use the channel again.

Reference: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/wireless/controller/9800/16-12/config-guide/b_wl_16_12_cg/cisco-cleanair.html

Note: Non-wifi interference are non 802.11 devices. These devices include microwave ovens, cordless phones, Bluetooth devices, wireless video cameras, outdoor microwave links, wireless game controllers, Zigbee devices, fluorescent lights, WiMAX, and so on.

2nd_item_that_m: jlugyydt##

D. 645298791871446
##jlugyydt

Answer: B

Explanation
The “{:#<15} : {:#<10}” is the string format which includes two placeholders. Both placeholders are left-aligned strings, padded with the # character if they are not long enough. The first placeholder is 15 characters long, and the second placeholder is 10 characters long.

The “format(key,str(value))” part inserts the values of the key and value variables into the string format.

Question 48
Refer to the exhibit.

hostname router 
ip domain-name cisco.com

line vty 0 15 
session-timeout 30 
exec-timeout 120 0 
login local

Which configuration must be added to enable remote access only using SSHv1 or SSHv2 to this router?

Option A
R1(config)# crypto key generate rsa modulus 2048
R1(config)# line vty 0 15
R1(config-line)# transport input ssh

Option B
R1(config)# ip ssh version 2
R1(config)# line vty 0 15
R1(config-line)# transport input ssh
R1(config-line)# transport output ssh

Option C
R1(config)# crypto key generate rsa modulus 2048
R1(config)# ip ssh version 2
R1(config)# line vty 0 15
R1(config-line)# transport input all

Option D
R1(config)# line vty 0 15
R1(config-line)# transport input ssh
R1(config-line)# transport output ssh

A. Option A
B. Option B
C. Option C
D. Option D

Answer: A

Explanation
To enable remote access via SSH, we only need the “transport input ssh” (not “transport output ssh”).

The command “crypto key generate rsa modulus 2048” is required to generate the RSA key with key-size of 2048 bits.

The “login local” command means that authentication uses locally configured credentials using the “username … password/secret …” command. Therefore in fact we need to configure an username and password on this device as well.

Steps to configure SSH:
1. Configure the router hostname using command “hostname”.
2. Configure the domain name using command “ip domain-name”.
3. Generate public and private keys using command “crypto key generate rsa”.
4. Create a user in the local database using command “username…secret”.
5. Allow only SSH access on VTY lines using command “transport input ssh”.

Question 51
Which two actions are recommended as security best practices to protect REST API? (Choose two)
A. Enable out-of-band authentication
B. Use a password hash
C. Use TACACS+ authentication
D. Use SSL for encryption
E. Enable dual authentication of the session

Answer: BD

Explanation
Passwords must always be hashed to protect the system (or minimize the damage) even if it is compromised in some hacking attempts. There are many such hashing algorithms that can prove really effective for password security e.g. PBKDF2, bcrypt, and scrypt algorithms. -> Answer B is correct.

By always using SSL, the authentication credentials can be simplified to a randomly generated access token. The token is delivered in the username field of HTTP Basic Auth. It’s relatively simple to use, and you get a lot of security features for free. -> Answer D is correct.

RESTful APIs should be stateless – so request authentication/authorization should not depend on sessions -> Answer E is not correct.

Question 52
How do the MAC address table and TCAM differ?
A. TCAM is populated from the ARP file, and the MAC address table is populated from the switch configuration file
B. TCAM stores Layer 2 forwarding information, and the MAC address table stores QoS information
C. TCAM is a type of memory and the MAC address table is a logical structure
D. TCAM lookups can match only 1s and 0s, and MAC address lookups can match 1s, 0s and a third “care/don’t care” state

Answer: C

Explanation
When using Ternary Content Addressable Memory (TCAM) inside routers it’s used for faster address lookup that enables fast routing.

MAC address table is contented in Content Addressable Memory (CAM), which is used for building and lookup of mac address table that enables L2 forwarding decisions.

Question 55
What does the Cisco WLC Layer 3 roaming feature allow clients to do?
A. maintain their IP address when roaming to an AP or controller with a different client VLAN assignment
B. maintain their connection between APs even when the AP management VLANs are different
C. maintain their connection even if the client IP address changes when roaming
D. roam seamlessly between controllers even when the controller management VLANs are different

Answer: A

Explanation
When a client starts an intercontroller roam, the two WLCs compare the VLAN IDs allocated to their WLAN interfaces. If the VLAN IDs are the same, then the client performs a Layer 2 intercontroller roam and keeps using its original IP address on the new AP and WLC. If the VLAN IDs are different, the WLCs will arrange a Layer 3 or local-to-foreign roam, allowing the client to continue using its current IP address.

Question 61
Which hypervisor requires a host OS to run and is not allowed to directly access the hosts hardware and resources?
A. native
B. bare metal
C. type 1
D. type 2

Answer: D

Explanation
In contrast to type 1 hypervisor, a type 2 hypervisor (or hosted hypervisor) runs on top of an operating system and not the physical hardware directly. A big advantage of Type 2 hypervisors is that management console software is not required. Examples of type 2 hypervisor are VMware Workstation (which can run on Windows, Mac and Linux) or Microsoft Virtual PC (only runs on Windows).

A network engineer must permit administrators to automatically authenticate if there is no response from either of the AAA servers. Which configuration achieves these results?
A. aaa authentication login default group tacacs+ line
B. aaa authentication login default group radius
C. aaa authentication enable default group radius local
D. aaa authentication login default group radius none

Answer: D

Explanation
If “automatically authenticate” means no authentication is required then answer D is correct with keyword “none” (requires no authentication if “radius” servers fails).

If “automatically authenticate” means authentication with local database of the router then answer C is correct with keyword “local” (requires authentication with local username & password).

But maybe this question implied “no authentication is required” so answer D is better.

Question 63
What is a characteristic of Cisco DNA southbound APIs?
A. implements monitoring by using the SOAP protocol
B. enables orchestration and automation of network devices based on intent
C. utilizes REST API
D. simplifies management of network devices

Answer: D

Explanation
Only Northbound APIs uses REST API -> Answer C is not correct. Also Northbound APIs are also called “Intent APIs” -> Answer B is not correct.

SOAP is a Northbound API -> Answer A is not correct.

Answer D is the best choice as Southbound API is used to communicated with network devices.

Question 64
How is OAuth framework used in REST API?
A. by providing the external application a token that authorizes access to the account
B. by providing the user credentials to the external application
C. as a framework to hide the security information in the REST URL
D. as a framework to hash the security information in the REST URL 

Answer: A

Explanation
Auth0 generates access tokens for API authorization scenarios, in JSON web token (JWT) format. The permissions represented by the access token, in OAuth terms, are known as scopes. When an application authenticates with Auth0, it specifies the scopes it wants. If those scopes are authorized by the user, then the access token will represent these authorized scopes.

How is CAPWAP data traffic encapsulated when running an Over the Top WLAN in a Cisco SD-Access wireless environment?
A. LISP
B. VXLAN
C. GRE
D. IPsec

Answer: B

Explanation
In SD-Access Wireless, the control plane is centralized. This means that, as with Cisco Unified Wireless Network, a Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP) tunnel is maintained between APs and WLC. The main difference is that in SD-Access Wireless, the data plane is distributed using a Virtual Extensible LAN (VXLAN) directly from the fabric-enabled APs.

Question 74
When does Cisco DNA Center make changes to a device?
A. when the device credentials are added
B. when the network device is assigned to the site and device controllability is turned on
C. when the network device is discovered and device controllability is turned on
D. when a NETCONF port has been configured

Answer: C

Explanation
Device controllability is a system-level process on Cisco DNA Center that enforces state synchronization for some device-layer features. Its purpose is to aid in the deployment of network settings that Cisco DNA Center needs to manage devices. Changes are made on network devices when running discovery, when adding a device to inventory, or when assigning a device to a site.

Therefore maybe both answer B and answer C are correct. But maybe answer C is a bit better.

Question 75
What are two characteristics of a directional antenna? (Choose two)
A. commonly used to cover large areas
B. low gain
C. provides the most focused and narrow beam-width
D. receive signals equally from all directions
E. high gain

Answer: CE

Explanation
A directional antenna transmits or receives signals in a specific direction only. Unlike omnidirectional antennas, directional antennas have a more focused beam designed to concentrate more energy in a single direction. This makes them more powerful than omnidirectional antennas and better suited for long-distance transmission.

Directional antennas have a higher signal gain than omnidirectional ones, allowing them to transmit signals over longer distances. This makes them the ideal choice for applications that require a more focused and specific transmission range. For instance, directional antennas are often used for satellite communication, radio astronomy, and long-distance wireless networking.

Question 76
Refer to the exhibit.

count = 8
while count > 4
   print(count)
   count -= 1
What is output by this code?

A. -1 -2 -3 -4
B. 8 7 6 5
C. 4 5 6 7
D. -4 -5 -6 -7

Answer: B

Explanation
This Python code uses a while loop to print the value of the variable count while it is greater than 4. The line count -= 1 is equivalent to count = count - 1 which decrements the value of count by 1 in each iteration of the loop.

Question 77A
Drag and drop the characteristics from the left onto the corresponding switching architectures on the right.
Which are related to the RIB? (Choose three)

A. It is built directly from the routing table
B. It is known as an IP routing table
C. It is build from information obtained from dynamic routing protocols, connected, and static routes
D. Each routing protocol has its own information base

Answer: BCD

Explanation
Each routing protocol like OSPF, EIGRP has its own Routing information base (RIB) and they select their best candidates to try to install to global RIB so that it can then be selected for forwarding. In order to view the RIB table, use the command “show ip ospf database” for OSPF, “show ip eigrp topology” for EIGRP or “show ip bgp” for BGP. To view the Forwarding Information Base (FIB), use the “show ip cef” command. RIB is in Control plane while FIB is in Data plane.

The Forwarding Information Base (FIB) contains destination reachability information as well as next hop information. This information is then used by the router to make forwarding decisions. The FIB allows for very efficient and easy lookups. Below is an example of the FIB table:

The FIB maintains next-hop address information based on the information in the IP routing table (RIB). In other words, FIB is a mirror copy of RIB.

RIB is in Control plane (and it is not used for forwarding) while FIB is in Data plane (and it is used for forwarding).

Question 79
An engineer is implementing a new SSID on a Cisco Catalyst 9800 Series WLC that must be broadcast on 6 GHz radios. Users will be required to use EAP-TLS to authenticate. Which wireless Layer 2 security method is required?
A. WPA2 Enterprise
B. WPA2 Personal
C. WPA3 Enterprise
D. WPA3 Personal

Answer: C

Explanation
EAP-TLS (Extensible Authentication Protocol with Transport Layer Security) is a more secure and scalable method, especially suitable for enterprise environments. It involves the use of digital certificates for both the client and the authentication server, providing a strong mutual authentication mechanism.

For enterprise deployments with the requirement of EAP-TLS, you should opt for WPA3-Enterprise or WPA2-Enterprise, depending on the compatibility of your devices.

WPA2-Enterprise uses EAP-TLS for authentication. It provides a high level of security but is based on older security standards.

WPA3-Enterprise is the latest Wi-Fi security standard and introduces improvements over WPA2. It supports EAP-TLS and includes additional security enhancements.

-> Therefore using WPA3 Enterprise is the better solution.

Question 86A
Drag and drop the QoS mechanisms from the left onto their descriptions on the right.
Which describes QoS shaping?
A. bandwidth management technique which delays datagrams
B. tool to enforce rate-limiting on ingress/egress
C. portion of the 802.1Q header used to classify packets

Answer: A

Explanation
Class of Service (CoS) is a 3 bit field within an Ethernet frame header when we use 802.1q which supports virtual LANs on an Ethernet network. This field specifies a priority value which is between 0 and 63 inclusive which can be used in the Quality of Service (QoS) to differentiate traffic.

Traffic policing is also known as rate limiting as it propagates bursts. When the traffic rate reaches the configured maximum rate (or committed information rate), excess traffic is dropped (or remarked). The result is an output rate that appears as a saw-tooth with crests and troughs.

Traffic shaping retains excess packets in a queue and then schedules the excess for later transmission over increments of time -> It causes delay.

Question 87
Drag and drop the code snippets from the bottom onto the blanks in the Python script to print the device model to the screen and write JSON data to a file. Not all options are used.

import json

data = {
....
}
____________ (data["devices"][0]["model"]
with ____________ ("data.json", "___________") as file:
json._____________ (data, file, incident=4)

A. dumps
B. print
C. dump
D. open
E. r
F. w

Answer: BDFC

Explanation
1. print
2. open
3. w
4. dump


This Python code defines a dictionary called data and then display the value associated with the key model in the first dictionary of the devices list. This will output the string “Cisco Nexus 3550”.

The code then opens a file called “data.json” in write mode using a with statement. The "w" in the second argument of the open() function indicates that the file should be opened in write mode.

The json.dump() method is then used to write the contents of the data dictionary to the “data.json” file in JSON format. The first argument to json.dump() is the dictionary to be written, the second argument is the file object to write to, and the indent parameter is set to 4 to make the output more readable.

We also tested this code and this is the result (file data.json is also created):

Question 92
When should the MAC authentication bypass feature be used on a switch port?
A. when the attached host supports 802.1X and must authenticate itself based on its MAC address instead of user credentials
B. when the attached host supports limited 802.1X
C. when authentication should be bypassed for select hosts based on their MAC address
D. when authentication is required, but the attached host does not support 802.1X

Answer: D

Explanation
802.1x is a great way to protect your network by authenticating everything you connect to your switch ports, However, one disadvantage of 802.1X is that your end devices have to support it. If you can’t use 802.1X but still want to secure your switch ports somehow, you can use MAC Authentication Bypass (MAB).

When you enable MAB on a switchport, the switch drops all frames except for the first frame to learn the MAC address. Pretty much any frame can be used to learn the MAC address except for CDP, LLDP, STP, and DTP traffic. Once the switch has learned the MAC address, it contacts an authentication server (RADIUS) to check if it permits the MAC address.

Question 93
To which category does a REST API that has been developed for IP address management integration belong?
A. southbound
B. eastbound
C. northbound
D. westbound

Answer: D

Explanation
+ Westbound (Integration) APIs: provide the capability to publish the network data, events and notifications to the external systems and consume information in Cisco DNA Center from the connected systems. Through integration APIs, Cisco DNA Center platform can power end-to-end IT processes across the value chain by integrating various domains such as IT Service Management (ITSM), IP address management (IPAM), and reporting.

Question 94
Which template is used when multiple templates are grouped together to run in succession in Cisco DNA Center?
A. regular
B. composite
C. project
D. configuration

Answer: B

Explanation
Composite templates allow for the reuse of multiple regular templates, which will enable us to modularize our code for reuse, thereby using smaller chunks of configuration. Composite templates also allow us one place to make changes that affect a broader set of devices. Thus, if we upgrade one regular template applied to multiple composite templates, we may effect change on a broader set of devices. This also allows us to reduce the duplication of efforts and minimize the administrator’s amount of effort.

Question 95
An engineer applies this configuration to router R1.

username cisco privilege 15 noescape secret 5 F7u$9cyE438490035m8TQ$nv&6502x
username cisco autocommand show startup-config
aaa authentication login default local-case enable
aaa authorization exec default local

How does R1 respond when the user ‘cisco’ logs in?
A. It places the user into EXEC mode and permits the user to execute any command
B. It displays the startup config and then permits the user to execute commands
C. It places the user into EXEC mode but permits the user to execute only the show startup-config command
D. It displays the startup config and then terminates the session

Answer: D

Explanation
The line “username cisco autocommand show startup-config” causes the specified command (“show startup-config” in this case) to be issued automatically after the user logs in. After the “autocommand” is executed, the user is logged out and the session is disconnected, unless you configure the “username user nohangup” option, which causes the session to remain active, giving the operator another login prompt.

The “noescape” keyword prevents a user from using an escape character on the host to which that user is connected.

Question 97
Which tag defines the roaming domain and properties of an AP deployment?
A. RF tag
B. policy tag
C. AP tag
D. site tag

Answer: D

Explanation
If custom/named site-tags are used, then all APs in the same named-site tags are assigned to the same WNCd. Consider site tag = roaming domain.

Reference: https://www.ciscolive.com/c/dam/r/ciscolive/global-event/docs/2023/pdf/BRKEWN-2338.pdf

Note:
Site Tag: Assigns the AP Join profile settings to the AP. The site tag defines the properties of a site, both central and remote (FlexConnect) site. The attributes of a site that are common across central and remote site are part of the AP Join profile.

 ip flow monitor NetFlow-Monitor input

The DevOps team noticed missing NetFlow data during peak utilization times for remote branches. Which configuration allows for this issue to be minimized or resolved?
A. Configure NetFlow on the in and outbound directions.
B. Configure long byte counters when specifying a flow record.
C. Change the transport type from UDP to TCP.
D. Change the flow monitor to IPv6 from IPv4.

Answer: B

Explanation
The “long” keyword enables collecting the total number of bytes or packets from the flow using a 64-bit counter rather than a 32-bit counter.

Reference: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios/fnetflow/command/reference/fnf_book/fnf_01.html#wp1305223

During peak utilization times, 32-bit counter may not be enough -> Answer B is the best choice.

Other answers are not correct as this issue is only observed in peak times.

Reference: https://blogs.cisco.com/developer/coding-essentials

Question 100
What is the function of an RP in a PIM-SM network?
A. to connect multicast sources with receivers
B. to track sources and receivers on the shared distribution tree
C. to automate the distribution of group-to rendezvous point mappings
D. to provide routing to the PIM leaf routers

Answer: A

Explanation
The concept of joining the rendezvous point (RP) is called the RPT (Root Path Tree) or shared distribution tree. The RP is the root of our tree which decides where to forward multicast traffic to. Each multicast group might have different sources and receivers so we might have different RPTs in our network.

An RP acts as the meeting place for sources and receivers of multicast data. In a PIM-SM network, sources must send their traffic to the RP. This traffic is then forwarded to receivers down a shared distribution tree

Reference: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/ipmulti_pim/configuration/xe-3s/imc-pim-xe-3s-book/imc_pim_allowrp.pdf

Answer B is not correct as a RP is the meeting point of sources and receivers only. It does not “track” sources and receivers.

Answer C is not correct as it is a function of Auto-RP: Auto-RP uses IP multicast to automate the distribution of group-to-RP mappings to all Cisco routers and multilayer switches in a PIM network.

Reference: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/metro/me3600x_3800x/software/release/12-2_52_ey/configuration/guide/swmcast.html

Answer D is surely not correct as RP does not “provide routing”.

Question 1
How do OSPF and EIGRP compare?
A. EIGRP shows all known routes, and OSPF shows successor and feasible successor routes.
B. Both OSPF and EIGRP use the concept of areas.
C. OSPF and EIGRP use the same administrative distance.
D. EIGRP shows successor and feasible successor routes, and OSPF shows all known routes.

Answer: D

Explanation
This question mentions about the EIGRP topology table (with command “show ip eigrp topology”), which keeps all the Successor and Feasible Successor routes. OSPF topology table (with command “show ip ospf database”) contains the entire road map of the network with all available OSPF routers.

Question 2
By default, which virtual MAC address does HSRP group 41 use?
A. 0c:5e:ac:07:0c:29
B. 00:05:0c:07:ac:41
C. 004:41:73:18:84:29
D. 00:00:0c:07:ac:29

Answer: D

Explanation
HSRP version 1 uses the MAC address range 0000.0C07.ACxx while HSRP version 2 uses the MAC address range 0000.0C9F.Fxxx.

The last two-digit hex value in the MAC address presents the HSRP group number. In this case 29 in decimal is 10 in hexadecimal. -> Answer D is correct.

Question 3
What is a characteristic of Layer 3 roaming?
A. Clients must obtain a new IP address when they roam between APs
B. It is only supported on controllers that run SSO.
C. It provides seamless client roaming between APs in different Layer 3 networks but within the same mobility group
D. It provides seamless roaming between APs that are connected to different Layer 3 networks and different mobility groups.

Answer: D

Explanation
Layer 3 roaming in wireless networks typically takes place between different mobility groups (but in the same mobility doamin). A mobility group refers to a set of WLCs that share information to facilitate client roaming.

When a client device roams between access points controlled by different WLCs within the same mobility group, it’s usually referred to as layer 2 roaming. In this scenario, the client maintains its IP address and session as it moves between access points, and the WLCs coordinate handoffs seamlessly.

However, when a client roams between access points controlled by WLCs in different mobility groups, it’s considered layer 3 roaming. In this case, the client may need to obtain a new IP address and establish a new session as it moves between different subnets or networks managed by different WLCs.

Question 4
Which element is unique to a Type 2 hypervisor?
A. memory
B. VM OS
C. host OS
D. host hardware

Answer: C

Explanation
“host OS” means “Underlying operating system”. In contrast to type 1 hypervisor, a type 2 hypervisor (or hosted hypervisor) runs on top of an operating system (and this is called host OS) and not the physical hardware directly.

Question 5
Refer to the exhibit.

Switch(config-ip-sla)# udp-jitter 172.29.139.134 5000
Switch(config-ip-sla-jitter)# frequency 300

Switch(config)# ip sla schedule 5 start-time now life forever
Switch(config)# end

What is the result of the IP SLA configuration?
A. The operation runs 300 times a day
B. The operation runs 5000 times a day
C. The rate is configured to repeat every 5 minutes
D. IP SLA is scheduled to run at 3 a.m

Answer: C

Explanation
“frequency 300” means it runs every 300 seconds (5 minutes).

Question 6
Which method requires a client to authenticate and has the capability to function without encryption?
A. open
B. WEP
C. WebAuth
D. PSK

Answer: C

Explanation
WebAuth is an authentication method without encryption.

Reference: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/wireless-mobility/wlan-security/115951-web-auth-wlc-guide-00.html

Note: WebAuth (Web Authentication) is an authentication method generally used as fallback authentication method. This authentication method needs a interactive user to enter the username and password to the web browser.

Question 7
Refer to the exhibit.

Layer 2 Security mode - None, WPA + WPA2, WPA2 + WPA3, Static WEP
Authorization list - Default

A client requests a new SSID that will use web-based authentication and external RADIUS servers. Which Layer 2 security mode must be selected?
A. WPA + WPA2
B. WPA2 + WPA3
C. Static WEP
D. None

Answer: D

Explanation
This document explains how to perform external web authentication using an external RADIUS Server.
…
Configure the WLAN on WLC for Web Authentication
The next step is to configure the WLAN for web authentication on WLC. Perform these steps in order to configure the WLAN on WLC:
1. Click the WLANs menu from the controller GUI, and choose New.
2. Choose WLAN for Type.
3. Enter a Profile Name and a WLAN SSID of your choice, and click Apply.
4. Under the General tab, make sure that the Enabled option is checked for both Status and Broadcast SSID.
5. Choose an interface for the WLAN. Typically, an interface configured in a unique VLAN is mapped to the WLAN so that the client receives an IP address in that VLAN. In this example, we use management for Interface.
6. Choose the Security tab.
7. Under the Layer 2 menu, choose None for Layer 2 Security.
8. Under the Layer 3 menu, choose None for Layer 3 Security. Check the Web Policy checkbox, and choose Authentication.

Question 8
Refer to the exhibit.

event manager applet CONFIG_BACKUP
action 1.0 cli command "enable"
action 3.0 cli command "end"
action 4.0 cli command "exit"

write_backup.tcl
set output [exec "copy run backup"]
set fd [open "flash:/backup.txt" "w"]
puts $fd $output
close $fd

ios_config "file prompt quiet" "end"
copy flash:/backup.txt tftp://10.1.1.23/backup.txt
ios_config "no file prompt quiet" "end"
file delete -force "flash:/backup.txt"

Which statement is needed to complete the EEM applet and use the Tcl script to store the backup file?
A. action 2.0 cli command “write_backup.tcl tcl”
B. action 2.0 cli command “flash:write_backup.tcl”
C. action 2.0 cli command “write_backup.tcl”
D. action 2.0 cli command “tclsh flash:write_backup.tcl”

Answer: D

Explanation
In order to run the “write_backup.tcl” file with Tcl script we need to use start the EEM applet with “tclsh …” command. Also notice that “action 2.0” will be put under “action 1.0” and above “action 3.0” so this Tcl script will be run after “enable” and before “end” command.

For your information, this Tcl script will do the following things:

+ ios_config “file prompt quiet” “end”: This command configures the device to suppress prompts for confirmation when performing file operations. It sets the device to not prompt the user when it is saving or copying files.

+ copy flash:/backup.txt tftp://10.1.1.23/backup.txt: This command copies a file named “backup.txt” from the device’s flash memory to a TFTP server located at the IP address 10.1.1.23. This is likely used for backing up configurations or other important files.

+ ios_config “no file prompt quiet” “end”: This command restores the default behavior of the device, enabling prompts for confirmation during file operations.

+ file delete -force “flash:/backup.txt”: This command deletes the “backup.txt” file from the device’s flash memory. The -force flag is used to bypass any confirmation prompts and delete the file immediately.

Question 9
What is a characteristics of Wi-Fi channels?
A. The 2.4-GHz band 2 non-overlapping channels
B. Devices that connect to the same Wi-Fi channel reside in the same collision domain.
C. Wi-Fi channels are spaced 30 MHz apart.
D. The 5-GHz band offers 11 different channels for Wi-Fi clients

Answer: B

Explanation
WiFi channels are smaller bands within WiFi frequency bands that are used by your wireless network to send and receive data. Depending on which frequency band your router is using, you have a certain number of WiFi channels to choose from:
+ 11 WiFi channels are in the 2.4 GHz frequency band (3 non-overlapping channels) -> Answer A is not correct.
+ 45 WiFi channels are in the 5 GHz frequency band (24 non-overlapping channels) -> Answer D is not correct.

Due to the WiFi standard, the channel spacing is 5 MHz. This causes that when the band is placed in a particular channel, for example, 6, there are 15MHz overlapping adjacent channels (part of 4, 5, 7, and 8) -> Answer C is not correct.

Question 10
Refer to the exhibit.

aaa new-model

An administrator must enable RESTCONF access to a router. Which two commands or command sets must be added to the existing configuration? (Choose two)

A. aaa authentication login default local
aaa authorization exec default local
B. restconf
C. username restconf privilege 0
D. netconf-yang

Answer: AB

Explanation
The CLI command to enable RESTCONF is displayed below:
restconf
Once enabled via CLI, all supported operations may be governed through model interfaces, including optional settings for RESTCONF configuration and operational data settings.

Reference: https://developer.cisco.com/docs/ios-xe/#!enabling-restconf-on-ios-xe/httphttps

Also we enable AAA so we need to configure suitable AAA commands for it.

Question 11
Which port is required to allow APs to join a WLC when directed broadcasts are used on a Cisco IOS switch?
A. UDP 5246
B. TCP 5246
C. TCP 5247
D. UDP 5247

Answer: A

Explanation
After the LAP gets an IP address from the DHCP server, the LAP broadcasts a Layer 3 CAPWAP discovery message on to its local subnet Normally these broadcast are limited to local subnet as it will not cross layer 3 boundaries.

Since CAPWAP broadcast uses UDP port 5246 it must be explicitly forwarded on the router. You have to use “ip forward-protocol udp <port-no>” CLI command for this.

Reference: https://mrncciew.com/2013/05/04/wlc-discovery-via-broadcast/

Question 12
Which security feature does stateless authentication and authorization use for REST API calls?
A. SSL/TLS certificate encryption
B. API keys
C. OAuth 2 token
D. Cookie-based session authentication

Answer: C

Explanation
Statelessness means that every HTTP request happens in complete isolation. When the client makes an HTTP request, it includes all information necessary for the server to fulfill the request.

The server never relies on information from previous requests from the client. If any such information is important then the client will send that as part of the current request.

Reference: https://restfulapi.net/statelessness/

TLS/SSL is stateful. The web server and the client (browser) cache the session including the cryptographic keys to improve performance and do not perform key exchange for every request. -> Answer A is not correct.

Cookie/Session Based Authentications are stateful. Here is how it works: The server creates a session ID upon a user’s login request, storing it in either a database or an in-memory cache on the server. This session ID is then stored on a cookie in the user’s browser. With each subsequent request, the server receives the cookie containing the session ID and validates the user’s identity by comparing it with the corresponding session information stored on the server. -> Answer D is not correct.

Token-based authentication enables users to obtain a token that allows them to access a service and/or fetch a specific resource without using their username and password to authenticate every request. Because the token can be a self-contained entity that conveys all the required information for authenticating the request, it is often referred to as stateless authentication.

The authentication token is created by the authenticating service and contains information to identify a particular user and the token validity. The token itself is cryptographically signed to prevent tampering.

After the token is validated by the service, it is used to establish security context for the client, so the service can make authorization decisions or audit activity for successive user requests -> Answer C is correct.

Reference: https://doubleoctopus.com/security-wiki/network-architecture/stateless-authentication/

When you use an API key to authenticate to an API, the API key does not identify a principal, nor does it provide any authorization information. -> Answer B is not correct.

Question 13

B. RESTCONF is not enabled on the device.
C. There is no BGP process running on the device

Answer: A

Explanation
After running this code, we received the message “HTTP Response: 404 Not Found” so answer A is the best choice.

Question 14
An engineer must configure HSRP for VLAN 1200 on SW1. The second switch is configured by using the last usable IP address in the network as the virtual IP. Which command set accomplishes this task?

Option A
SW1(config)#interface vlan 1200
SW1(config-if)#ip address 172.12.0.2 255.255.255.0
SW1(config-if)#standby 1200 ip 172.12.0.254
SW1(config-if)#standby 1200 timers 5 15
SW1(config-if)#standby 1200 preempt

Option B
SW1(config)#interface vlan 1200
SW1(config-if)#ip address 172.12.0.2 255.255.255.0
SW1(config-if)#standby version 2
SW1(config-if)#standby 1200 ip 172.12.0.254
SW1(config-if)#standby 1200 preempt

Option C
SW1(config)#interface vlan 1200
SW1(config-if)#ip address 172.12.0.1 255.255.255.0
SW1(config-if)#standby 1200 ip 172.12.0.254
SW1(config-if)#standby 1200 timers 5 15
SW1(config-if)#standby 1200 preempt

Option D
SW1(config)#interface vlan 1200
SW1(config-if)#ip address 172.12.0.254 255.255.255.0
SW1(config-if)#standby version 2
SW1(config-if)#standby 1200 ip 172.12.0.2
SW1(config-if)#standby 1200 preempt

A. Option A
B. Option B
C. Option C
D. Option D

Answer: B

Explanation
The group numbers of HSRP version 1 range from 0 to 255. HSRP does support group number of 0 (we do check it and in fact, it is the default group number if you don’t enter group number in the configuration) so HSRP version 1 supports up to 256 group numbers. HSRP version 2 supports 4096 group numbers so in this question we must configure HSRP version 2.

The virtual IP address must be the same on two HSRP switches so we must have command “standby 1200 ip 172.12.0.254” on both switches.

Question 15

Question 16
When the ”deny” statement is used within a route map that is used for policy-based routing, how is the traffic that matches the deny route-map line treated?
A. An additional sequential route-map line is needed to policy route this traffic.
B. Traffic is routed to the null 0 interface of the router and discarded.
C. An additional sequential route-map line is needed to divert the traffic to the router’s normal forwarding behavior.
D. Traffic is returned to the normal forwarding behavior of the router.

Answer: D

Explanation
Within a route map used for PBR, you can reference ACLs to match specific types of traffic. The deny statements in these ACLs are effectively ignored in the context of PBR. This means that when a packet matches a ‘deny’ statement in an ACL referenced by a route map for PBR, it is not actively denied; rather, it is not matched by the PBR policy and thus is processed using the regular routing table, not the PBR-defined path.

Question 19
What is the architectural difference between the MAC address table and TCAM?
A. TCAM entries are stored for 600 seconds, and MAC address table entries are kept for 200 seconds
B. TCAM entries are populated using the ARP table and the MAC address table is populated dynamically from outgoing frames
C. TCAM entries consist of VLAN port ID and source MAC Address, and MAC address table entries consist of source MAC address and port ID
D. TCAM entries are composed of value, mask, and result and MAC address table entries are composed of value and results

Answer: D

Explanation
Each TCAM entry consist of three components: Value, Mask and Result. -> Answer C is not correct.

Reference: https://learningnetwork.cisco.com/s/article/tcam-demystified

MAC address table entries are composted of value, which is an INDEX or key value (MAC) and looks up for a result value (port ID or VlanID) -> Answer D is correct.

The default aging time of MAC address entries is 5 minutes (300 seconds) -> Answer A is correct.

MAC address table is populated by incoming frames -> Answer B is not correct.

Question 20
What is a difference between OSPF and EIGRP?
A. OSPF is an advanced distance vector protocol, EIGRP is a link-state protocol.
B. OSPF is a hybrid routing protocol, EIGRP is a link-state routing protocol
C. OSPF uses the DUAL algorithm, EIGRP uses the SPF algorithm
D. OSPF uses an administrative distance of 110, EIGRP uses an administrative distance of 170.

Answer: D

Explanation
OSPF is a link-state routing protocol while EIGRP is an advanced distance vector protocol -> Answer A and answer B are not correct.

EIGRP uses DUAL algorithm while OSPF uses SPF algorithm -> Answer C is not correct.

OSPF administrative distance is 110 and EIGRP External route administrative distance is 170 -> Answer D is correct although it is tricky.

Question 21
Which Cisco WLC feature allows a wireless device to perform a Layer 3 roam between two separate controllers without changing the client IP address?
A. LWAPP tunnel
B. mobile IP
C. mobility tunnel
D. GRE tunnel

Answer: C

Explanation
The controller supports seamless roaming across multiple mobility groups. During seamless roaming, the client maintains its IP address across all mobility groups. When a client crosses a mobility group boundary during a roam, the client is fully authenticated, but the IP address is maintained, and mobility tunneling is initiated for Layer 3 roaming.

Question 22
An engineer adds a new switch to a Cisco StackWise stack. The switch that was active before the switch was added is elected as the active switch again. Which action does the active switch take?
A. It suspends traffic forwarding until the new switch is updated with the current running configuration of the stack.
B. It clears the MAC table of the stack and relearns the attached devices.
C. It removes any Layer 3 configuration on the new switch to maintain normal Layer 2 functionality on the stack.
D. It checks the IOS and running configuration of the new switch and updates them if necessary to match the other switches in the stack.

Answer: D

Explanation 

Question 23
An engineer must configure a router to allow users to run specific configuration commands by validating the user against the router database. Which configuration must be applied?
A. aaa authorization exec default local
B. aaa authorization network default local
C. aaa authentication exec default local
D. aaa authentication network default local

Answer: A

Explanation
“allow users to run specific configuration commands” which means authorization, not authentication so we need the “aaa authorization …” command.

“Enable AAA authorization with the network keyword to allow interface configuration from the RADIUS server.” -> Answer B is not correct.

Reference: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst4500/12-2/31sga/configuration/guide/config/dot1x.html

-> Only answer A is left. We need the keyword “exec” to allow user to run an EXEC shell.

Question 24
What is a common trait between Ansible and Chef?
A. Both are used for mutable infrastructure.
B. Both rely on a declarative approach.
C. Both require a client to be installed on hosts.
D. Both rely on NETCONF.

Answer: A

Explanation
Ansible is a procedural tool, meaning that each Ansible playbook defines the steps to transform your infrastructure or configuration into what it should look like.

Chef is procedural, meaning that rather than defining the end state, you write configuration code to determine how your infrastructure setup should eventually look.

-> Answer B is not correct.

Reference: https://redpanda.com/blog/ansible-terraform-chef-salt-puppet-cloud

Ansible is Agentless while Chef is Agent Based Architecture. Agentless means that the managed device does not need any code (agent) to be installed on it. Therefore Ansible uses SSH (NETCONF over SSH in particular) to “push” changes and extract information to managed devices.

Ansible_Puppet_Chef_compare.jpg

-> Answer C is not correct.

Ansible uses SSH/NETCONF while Chef use REST -> Answer D is not correct.

Note: The concept for mutable and immutable infrastructure is whether or not an environment can change after its creation. While a mutable environment allows changes to be made during its lifecycle, like fixing configuration errors and updating the resources that are already provisioned, in an immutable environment, that would not be possible. The resource is destroyed and created again with a new version.

Question 25
Which device, in a LISP routing architecture, receives and de-encapsulates LISP traffic for endpoints within a LISP-capable site?
A. MR
B. ETR
C. OMS
D. ITR

Answer: B

Explanation

Egress Tunnel Router (ETR) is the device (or function) that connects a site to the LISP-capable part of a core network (such as the Internet), publishes EID-to-RLOC mappings for the site, responds to Map-Request messages, and decapsulates and delivers LISP-encapsulated user data to end systems at the site. During operation, an ETR sends periodic Map-Register messages to all its configured map servers.

Question 26
What is used by vManage to interact with Cisco SD-WAN devices in the fabric?

Question 28
What are two benefits of using Cisco TrustSec? (Choose two)
A. advanced endpoint protection against malware
B. end-to-end traffic encryption
C. consistent network segmentation
D. simplified management of network access
E. unknown file analysis using sandboxing

Answer: CD

Explanation
Cisco TrustSec simplifies the provisioning and management of secure access to network services and applications. Unlike access control mechanisms that are based on network topology, Cisco TrustSec policies use logical groupings, so access is consistently maintained even as resources are moved in mobile and virtualized networks.

Reference: https://www.zones.com/images/pdf/cisco-trustsec.pdf

Question 29
Which action occurs during a Layer 3 roam?
A. The client receives a new ip address after authentication occurs
B. The client is marked as “Foreign” on the original controller
C. Client database entry is moved from the old controller to the new controller
D. Client traffic is tunneled back to the original controller after a Layer 3 roam occurs

Answer: D

Explanation
In instances where the client roams between APs that are connected to different WLCs and the WLC WLAN is connected to a different subnet, a Layer 3 roam is performed, and there is an update between the new WLC (foreign WLC) and the old WLC (anchor WLC) mobility databases.

If this is the case, return traffic to the client still goes through its originating anchor WLC. The anchor WLC uses Ethernet over IP (EoIP) to forward the client traffic to the foreign WLC, to where the client has roamed. Traffic from the roaming client is forwarded out the foreign WLC interface on which it resides; it is not tunneled back. (-> Answer D is not correct). But this is contradict to what is said in the Official Cert Guide book:

“A Layer 3 intercontroller roam consists of an extra tunnel that is built between the client’s original controller and the controller it has roamed to. The tunnel carries data to and from the client as if it is still associated with the original controller and IP subnet.” 

Layer3_roaming_wlc.jpgThe client begins with a connection to AP B on WLC 1. This creates an ANCHOR entry in the WLC client database. As the client moves away from AP B and makes an association with AP C, WLC 2 sends a mobility announcement to peers in the mobility group looking for the WLC with the client MAC address. WLC 1 responds to the announcement, handshakes, and ACKs. Next the client database entry for the roaming client is copied to WLC 2, and marked as FOREIGN. Included PMK data (master key data from the RADIUS server) is also copied to WLC 2. This provides fast roam times for WPA2/802.11i clients because there is no need to re-authenticate to the RADIUS server.

After a simple key exchange between the client and AP, the client is added to the WLC 2 database and is similar, except that it is marked as FOREIGN.

Reference: https://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/solutions/Enterprise/Mobility/emob30dg/TechArch.html

In Layer 3 roaming, no IP address refresh needed (although client must be re-authenticated and new security session established) -> Answer A is not correct.

In summary, the “Mobility State” of a client is described below:
+ Before roaming: Mobility State = Local
+ After roaming: Mobility State on Old Database = Anchor; Mobility State on New Database = Foreign

Therefore the client entry on the original controller is not passed to the database totally. The client entry is still on the old controller but it is marked “Anchor” (not “Foreign”) -> Answer B is not correct.

Answer C is not correct as the “Client database entry is not moved, but copied to the new controller.

-> Therefore the best choice should be answer D.

Question 30
The Radio Resource Management software that is embedded in the Cisco WLC acts as a manager to constantly monitor over-the-air metrics. Which other factor does the Radio Resource Management software detect?
A. end-node vulnerabilities
B. unauthorized wireless network access
C. presence of rogue APs or malicious SSIDs
D. repeated attempts to authenticate to a wireless network

Answer: C

Explanation
The Radio Resource Management (RRM) software embedded in the Cisco Wireless LAN Controller acts as a built-in RF engineer to consistently provide real-time RF management of your wireless network. RRM enables Cisco WLCs to continually monitor their associated lightweight access points.

Reference: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/wireless/controller/8-8/config-guide/b_cg88/radio_resource_management.html

One of the functions of RRM is Radio Resource Monitoring.

RRM automatically detects and configures new Cisco WLCs and lightweight access points as they are added to the network. It then automatically adjusts associated and nearby lightweight access points to optimize coverage and capacity.
Lightweight access points can simultaneously scan all valid 5-GHz and 2.4-GHz channels for the country of operation as well as for channels available in other locations. The access points go “off-channel” for a period not greater than 60 ms to monitor these channels for noise and interference. Packets collected during this time are analyzed to detect rogue access points, rogue clients, ad-hoc clients, and interfering access points.

A JSON string should always start with {} (an object) or [] (an array) -> Option C is not correct.

In a JSON string, the key/value pairs are always in double quotes "" -> Option A and Option B are not correct.

An engineer attempts to use RESTCONF to configure GigabitEthernet2 on a remote router with IP address 192.168.159.10, but the configuration fails. Which configuration is required to complete the action?

Option A
data = json.dumps({
 'Cisco-IOS-XE-native:GiagabitEthernet2': {

Option B
data = json.dumps({
 'Cisco-IOS-XE-native:GigabitEthernet': {
         'ip': {
                'address': {
                      'interface': {

Option C
url = 'https://192.168.159.10/restconf/data/Cisco-IOS-XE-native:native/interface/GigabitEthernet2',

Option D
response = requests.patch(

A. Option A
B. Option B
C. Option C
D. Option D

Answer: D

Explanation
In the exhibit, the response.get method is used to retrieve information from the given server using a given URL so it cannot be used to configure a remote device. We should use PATCH (requests.patch) method instead.

Question 37
A customer deployed an ISE solution that allows for web authentication and URL redirect enforced from the access layer. Due to control plane security concerns, only host IP 10.0.1.25 should have HTTP access to these switches. Which configuration must be applied to the switches?

Option A
ip access-list standard 10 
 deny 10.0.1.25 0.0.0.0 
 permit any 
 ip http server 
 ip http secure-server 
 class-map CoPP_Class 
 match access_group 10 
 policy-map CoPP_Policy 
 class CoPP_Class
 police 100000 conform-action permit exceed-action drop violate-action drop 
 control-plane
 service-policy input CoPP_Policy

Option B
ip access-list standard 10 
 permit 10.0.1.25 0.0.0.0 
 ip http server 
 ip http secure-server
 ip http secure-active-session-modules none 
 ip http access-class 10

Option C
ip access-list extended HOST-ACL 
 10 permit host 10.0.1.25 any 
 20 deny any any 
 no ip http server 
 ip http secure-server 
 class-map CoPP_Class 
 match access_group HOST-ACL 
 policy-map CoPP_Policy 
 class CoPP_Class
 police 100000 conform-action permit exceed-action drop violate-action drop 
 control-plane
 service-policy input CoPP_Policy

Option D
ip access-list extended HOST-ACL
 10 permit host 10.0.1.25 any 
 20 deny any any 
 ip http server 
 ip http secure-server
 ip http secure-active-session-modules none 
 ip http active-session-modules none 
 ip http access-class HOST-ACL

A. Option A
B. Option B
C. Option C
D. Option D

Answer: B

Explanation
Option A and Option C use CoPP but they do not solve the problem with “conform-action permit” (in fact it should be “conform-action transmit”). With Option A, host 10.0.1.25 is allowed unconstrained (deny 10.0.1.25 which means CoPP is not applied to this host) while other hosts are applied CoPP. But with “conform-action transmit”, these hosts can still access the devices.

The “ip http access-class” command can only be used with a standard ACL in the range 0 to 99 -> Only Option B is correct.

Question 38
An engineer must construct an access list for a Cisco Catalyst 9800 Series WLC that will redirect wireless guest users to a splash page that is hosted on a Cisco ISE server. The Cisco ISE servers are hosted at 10.9.11.144 and 10.1.11.141. Which access list meets the requirements?

Option A
ip access-list extended ACL_WEBAUTH_REDIRECT
 70 deny ip any host 10.9.11.141
 80 deny ip any host 10.1.11.141
 500 permit tcp any any eq www
 600 permit tcp any any eq 443
 700 permit tcp any any eq 8443
 800 deny udp any any eq domain

Option B
ip access-list extended ACL_WEBAUTH_REDIRECT
 50 deny ip host 10.9.11.141 any 
 60 deny ip any host 10.9.11.141
 70 deny ip host 10.1.11.141 any 
 80 deny ip any host 10.1.11.141 
 500 permit tcp any any eq www
 600 permit tcp any any eq 443
 700 permit tcp any any eq 80

Option C
ip access-list extended ACL_WEBAUTH_REDIRECT
 70 permit ip any host 10.9.11.141
 80 permit ip any host 10.1.11.141
 500 permit tcp any any eq www
 800 permit tcp any any eq 443
 700 permit tcp any any eq 8443
 800 deny udp any any eq domain

Option D
ip access-list extended ACL_WEBAUTH_REDIRECT
 70 permit ip any host 10.9.11.141
 80 permit ip any host 10.1.11.141
 500 deny tcp any any eq www
 600 deny tcp any any eq 443
 700 deny tcp any any eq 8443
 800 deny udp any any eq domain
 901 deny ip any any

A. Option A
B. Option B
C. Option C
D. Option D

Answer: B

Explanation
For the redirection ACL, think of the deny action as a deny redirection (not deny traffic) and the permit action as permit redirection. The WLC only looks into traffic that it can redirect (ports 80 and 443 by default).

CLI:

ip access-list extended REDIRECT
 deny ip any host <ISE-IP>
 deny ip host <ISE-IP> any
 deny udp any any eq domain
 deny udp any eq domain any
 permit tcp any any eq 80
Reference: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/wireless/catalyst-9800-series-wireless-controllers/213920-central-web-authentication-cwa-on-cata.html

-> Option B is the best choice.

Question 39
Drag and drop the snippets onto the blanks within the code to construct a script that blocks a MAC address.

event manager applet mac_block
event timer ___________ time 10
action 01 cli command "enable"
action 02 cli command "ter len 0"
action 03 cli command "show mac add"
action 04 regexp "_____________" match ports
action 05 if $_regexp_result eq _________________
action 06 cli command "conf t"
action 07 cli command "int $ports"
action 08 cli command "shut"
action 09 end

A. Gig
B. 1
C. Watchdog

Answer: CAB

Explanation
The “watchdog” keyword specifies that an event is triggered when the specified time counts down to zero. The timer automatically resets to the initial value and continues to count down.

The statement “action 04 regexp “(Gi…)” match Ports” means if any GigabitEthernet interface is found in the “show mac address-table 0050.7966.6800” then save the result in “Ports” variable.

The statement “action 05 if $_regexp_result eq 1” means if a match is found then perform below commands.

Question 40

  G0/0/0-7        G0/0/0-7
SWA=======================SWB

Operations - Vlan 30
Sales - Vlan 20

SWA# int range g0/0/0-7
Switchport mode dynamic auto
Switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q
Switchport trunk allowed vlan 1,10,20,30,50
Channel-group 5 mode auto

SWB# int range g0/0/0-7
Switchport mode dynamic auto
Switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q
Switchport trunk allowed vlan 1,10,20,30,40
Channel-group 5 mode desirable

Users in the Operations VLAN on Switch A are unable to communicate with users in the Operations VLAN on Switch B. Which action resolves the issue?
A. Set the switchport mode to dynamic desirable on Switch B.
B. Set the EtherChannel mode to LACP on Switch A.
C. Configure the same allowed VLAN list on Switch A and Switch B.
D. Set the EtherChannel mode to PAGP on Switch B.

Answer: A

Explanation
Answer B is not correct as we can use either PAgP or LACP.

Answer C is not correct as we only care about Operations VLAN, which is VLAN 30. This VLAN was allowed on both switches.

Answer D is not correct as PAGP has been configured already on both switches.

Therefore only answer A is left and this is the correct choice. We tested with above configuration, the Port-channel interface was still up but with “static access” operating mode:

SwitchB#show interface port-channel 5 switchport
Name: Po5
Switchport: Enabled
Administrative Mode: dynamic auto
Operational Mode: static access
Administrative Trunking Encapsulation: dot1q
Operational Trunking Encapsulation: native
Negotiation of Trunking: On
Access Mode VLAN: 1 (default)
Trunking Native Mode VLAN: 1 (default)
Administrative Native VLAN tagging: enabled
--output omitted--
Trunking VLANs Enabled: 1,10,20,30,40
Pruning VLANs Enabled: 2-1001
But after changing to “dynamic desirable” on Switch B (use the “switchport mode dynamic desirable” under physical interfaces), the operating mode changed to trunk:

SwitchB#show interface port-channel 5 switchport
Name: Po5
Switchport: Enabled
Administrative Mode: dynamic desirable
Operational Mode: trunk
Administrative Trunking Encapsulation: dot1q
Operational Trunking Encapsulation: dot1q
Negotiation of Trunking: On
Access Mode VLAN: 1 (default)
Trunking Native Mode VLAN: 1 (default)
Administrative Native VLAN tagging: enabled
--output omitted--
Trunking VLANs Enabled: 1,10,20,30,40
Pruning VLANs Enabled: 2-1001
The reason is shown in the table below. If both ends are “dynamic auto” then a trunk cannot be formed. But with one end configures as “dynamic desirable” then a trunk is formed:

Question 49
Drag and drop characteristics of PIM dense mode from the left to the right. (Choose three)
A. Requires a rendezvous point to deliver multicast traffic
B. Builds source-based distribution trees
C. Uses a pull model to distribute multicast traffic
D. Uses a push model to distribute multicast traffic
E. Uses prune mechanisms to stop unwanted multicast traffic
F. Builds shared distribution trees

Answer: BDE

Explanation
PIM Dense Mode:
+ builds source-based distribution trees
+ uses a push model to distribute multicast traffic
+ uses prune mechanisms to stop unwanted multicast traffic

PIM-DM supports only source trees – that is, (S,G) entries–and cannot be used to build a shared distribution tree.

Reference: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/ipmulti_pim/configuration/xe-16-5/imc-pim-xe-16-5-book/imc-tech-oview.html

PIM dense mode (PIM-DM) uses a push model to flood multicast traffic to every corner of the network. This push model is a brute-force method of delivering data to the receivers. This method would be efficient in certain deployments in which there are active receivers on every subnet in the network. PIM-DM initially floods multicast traffic throughout the network. Routers that have no downstream neighbors prune the unwanted traffic. This process repeats every 3 minutes.

A rendezvous point (RP) is required only in networks running Protocol Independent Multicast sparse mode (PIM-SM).

In PIM dense mode (PIM-DM), multicast traffic is initially flooded to all segments of the network. Routers that have no downstream neighbors or directly connected receivers prune back the unwanted traffic.
