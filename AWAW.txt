Question 361
A solutions architect wants to use the following JSON text as an identity-based policy to grant specific permissions:

“Statement”: [{
“Action”: [“ssm:ListDocuments”, “ssm:GetDocument”]
“Effect”: “Allow”,
“Resource”: “*”,
“Sid”: “”

Which IAM principals can the solutions architect attach this policy to? (Choose two.)
A.
Role
B.
Group
C.
Organization
D.
Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) resource
E.
Amazon EC2 resource

Answer: AB

Explanation:
AB is correct, but the question is misleading because, according to the AWS IAM documentation, groups are not considered principals: 
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/intro-structure.html#intro-structure-principal."

Question 362
A company is running a custom application on Amazon EC2 On-Demand Instances. The application has frontend nodes that need to run 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and backend nodes that need to run only for a short time based on workload. The number of backend nodes varies during the day.
The company needs to scale out and scale in more instances based on workload.
Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?
A.
Use Reserved Instances for the frontend nodes. Use AWS Fargate for the backend nodes.
B.
Use Reserved Instances for the frontend nodes. Use Spot Instances for the backend nodes.
C.
Use Spot Instances for the frontend nodes. Use Reserved Instances for the backend nodes.
D.
Use Spot Instances for the frontend nodes. Use AWS Fargate for the backend nodes.

Answer: B

Explanation:
Not A because Fargate runs containers, not EC2 instances. But we have no indication that the workload would be containerized; it runs "on EC2 instances".
Not C and D because frontend must run 24/7, can't use Spot.
Thus B, yes, Spot instances are risky, but as they need to run "only for a short time" it seems acceptable.
Technically ideal option would be Reserved Instances for frontend nodes and On-demand instances for backend nodes, but that is not an option here.


Question 363
A company uses high block storage capacity to runs its workloads on premises. The company's daily peak input and output transactions per second are not more than 15,000 IOPS. The company wants to migrate the workloads to Amazon EC2 and to provision disk performance independent of storage capacity.
Which Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume type will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?
A.
GP2 volume type
B.
io2 volume type
C.
GP3 volume type
D.
io1 volume type

Answer: C

Explanation:
The GP3 (General Purpose SSD) volume type in Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) is the most cost-effective option for the given requirements. GP3 volumes offer a balance of price and performance and are suitable for a wide range of workloads, including those with moderate I/O needs.
GP3 volumes allow you to provision performance independently from storage capacity, which means you can adjust the baseline performance (measured in IOPS) and throughput (measured in MiB/s) separately from the volume size. This flexibility allows you to optimize your costs while meeting the workload requirements.
In this case, since the company's daily peak input and output transactions per second are not more than 15,000 IOPS, GP3 volumes provide a suitable and cost-effective option for their workloads.

Question 364
A company needs to store data from its healthcare application. The application’s data frequently changes. A new regulation requires audit access at all levels of the stored data.
The company hosts the application on an on-premises infrastructure that is running out of storage capacity. A solutions architect must securely migrate the existing data to AWS while satisfying the new regulation.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Use AWS DataSync to move the existing data to Amazon S3. Use AWS CloudTrail to log data events.
B.
Use AWS Snowcone to move the existing data to Amazon S3. Use AWS CloudTrail to log management events.
C.
Use Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration to move the existing data to Amazon S3. Use AWS CloudTrail to log data events.
D.
Use AWS Storage Gateway to move the existing data to Amazon S3. Use AWS CloudTrail to log management events.

Answer: A

Explanation:
B and C don't solve the problem
A is extending the data and management events are for administrative actions only (tracking account creation, user security actions etc.).
C uses DataSync to move all the data and logs data events which include S3 file uploads and downloads.
Management events: User logs into an EC2 instance, creates an S3 IAM role
Data events: User uploads a file to S3

Question 365
A solutions architect is implementing a complex Java application with a MySQL database. The Java application must be deployed on Apache Tomcat and must be highly available.
What should the solutions architect do to meet these requirements?
A.
Deploy the application in AWS Lambda. Configure an Amazon API Gateway API to connect with the Lambda functions.
B.
Deploy the application by using AWS Elastic Beanstalk. Configure a load-balanced environment and a rolling deployment policy.
C.
Migrate the database to Amazon ElastiCache. Configure the ElastiCache security group to allow access from the application.
D.
Launch an Amazon EC2 instance. Install a MySQL server on the EC2 instance. Configure the application on the server. Create an AMI. Use the AMI to create a launch template with an Auto Scaling group.

Answer: B

Explanation:
AWS Elastic Beanstalk provides an easy and quick way to deploy, manage, and scale applications. It supports a variety of platforms, including Java and Apache Tomcat. By using Elastic Beanstalk, the solutions architect can upload the Java application and configure the environment to run Apache Tomcat.

Question 366
A serverless application uses Amazon API Gateway, AWS Lambda, and Amazon DynamoDB. The Lambda function needs permissions to read and write to the DynamoDB table.
Which solution will give the Lambda function access to the DynamoDB table MOST securely?
A.
Create an IAM user with programmatic access to the Lambda function. Attach a policy to the user that allows read and write access to the DynamoDB table. Store the access_key_id and secret_access_key parameters as part of the Lambda environment variables. Ensure that other AWS users do not have read and write access to the Lambda function configuration.
B.
Create an IAM role that includes Lambda as a trusted service. Attach a policy to the role that allows read and write access to the DynamoDB table. Update the configuration of the Lambda function to use the new role as the execution role.
C.
Create an IAM user with programmatic access to the Lambda function. Attach a policy to the user that allows read and write access to the DynamoDB table. Store the access_key_id and secret_access_key parameters in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store as secure string parameters. Update the Lambda function code to retrieve the secure string parameters before connecting to the DynamoDB table.
D.
Create an IAM role that includes DynamoDB as a trusted service. Attach a policy to the role that allows read and write access from the Lambda function. Update the code of the Lambda function to attach to the new role as an execution role.

Answer: B

Explanation:
DynamoDB needs to trust Lambda. NOT the other way around. So Lambda must be configured as a trusted service. Role for service which gives B and D options. D is setting up (somehow?) to allow Lambda to trust DynamoDB... or the wording makes no sense.

Question 367
The following IAM policy is attached to an IAM group. This is the only policy applied to the group.

{ “Version”: “2012-10-17”,
“Statement”: [{
“Sid”: “1”,
“Effect”: “Allow”,
“Action”: “ec2:*”,
“Resource”: “*”,
“Condition”: { “StringEquals”: {
“ec2:Region”: “us-east-1”
} } },
{ “Sid”: “2”,
“Effect”: “Deny”,
“Action”: [ “ec2:StopInstances”, “ec2:TerminateInstances” ]
“Resource”: “*”,
“Condition”: { “BoolIfExists”: {
“aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent”: “false”
} } } } }

What are the effective IAM permissions of this policy for group members?
A.
Group members are permitted any Amazon EC2 action within the us-east-1 Region. Statements after the Allow permission are not applied.
B.
Group members are denied any Amazon EC2 permissions in the us-east-1 Region unless they are logged in with multi-factor authentication (MFA).
C.
Group members are allowed the ec2:StopInstances and ec2:TerminateInstances permissions for all Regions when logged in with multi-factor authentication (MFA). Group members are permitted any other Amazon EC2 action.
D.
Group members are allowed the ec2:StopInstances and ec2:TerminateInstances permissions for the us-east-1 Region only when logged in with multi-factor authentication (MFA). Group members are permitted any other Amazon EC2 action within the us-east-1 Region.

Answer: D

Explanation:
D. Group members are allowed the ec2:StopInstances and ec2:TerminateInstances permissions for the us-east-1 Region only when logged in with multi-factor authentication (MFA). Group members are permitted any other Amazon EC2 action within the us-east-1 Region

Question 368
A company has an on-premises application that generates a large amount of time-sensitive data that is backed up to Amazon S3. The application has grown and there are user complaints about internet bandwidth limitations. A solutions architect needs to design a long-term solution that allows for both timely backups to Amazon S3 and with minimal impact on internet connectivity for internal users.
Which solution meets these requirements?
A.
Establish AWS VPN connections and proxy all traffic through a VPC gateway endpoint.
B.
Establish a new AWS Direct Connect connection and direct backup traffic through this new connection.
C.
Order daily AWS Snowball devices. Load the data onto the Snowball devices and return the devices to AWS each day.
D.
Submit a support ticket through the AWS Management Console. Request the removal of S3 service limits from the account.

Answer: B

Explanation:
Option B (correct). Establish a new AWS Direct Connect connection and direct backup traffic through this new connection.
AWS Direct Connect is a network service that allows you to establish a dedicated network connection from your on-premises data center to AWS. This connection bypasses the public Internet and can provide more reliable, lower-latency communication between your on-premises application and Amazon S3. By directing backup traffic through the AWS Direct Connect connection, you can minimize the impact on your internet bandwidth and ensure timely backups to S3.

Option A (wrong), establishing AWS VPN connections and proxying all traffic through a VPC gateway endpoint, would not necessarily minimize the impact on internet bandwidth as it would still utilize the public Internet to access S3. 
Option C (wrong), using AWS Snowball devices, would not address the issue of internet bandwidth limitations as the data would still need to be transferred over the Internet to and from the Snowball devices. 
Option D (wrong), submitting a support ticket to request the removal of S3 service limits, would not address the issue of internet bandwidth limitations and would not ensure timely backups to S3.

Question 369
A manufacturing company has machine sensors that upload .csv files to an Amazon S3 bucket. These .csv files must be converted into images and must be made available as soon as possible for the automatic generation of graphical reports.
The images become irrelevant after 1 month, but the .csv files must be kept to train machine learning (ML) models twice a year. The ML trainings and audits are planned weeks in advance.
Which combination of steps will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively? (Choose two.)
A.
Launch an Amazon EC2 Spot Instance that downloads the .csv files every hour, generates the image files, and uploads the images to the S3 bucket.
B.
Design an AWS Lambda function that converts the .csv files into images and stores the images in the S3 bucket. Invoke the Lambda function when a .csv file is uploaded.
C.
Create S3 Lifecycle rules for .csv files and image files in the S3 bucket. Transition the .csv files from S3 Standard to S3 Glacier 1 day after they are uploaded. Expire the image files after 30 days.
D.
Create S3 Lifecycle rules for .csv files and image files in the S3 bucket. Transition the .csv files from S3 Standard to S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA) 1 day after they are uploaded. Expire the image files after 30 days.
E.
Create S3 Lifecycle rules for .csv files and image files in the S3 bucket. Transition the .csv files from S3 Standard to S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) 1 day after they are uploaded. Keep the image files in Reduced Redundancy Storage (RRS).

Answer: BC

Explanation:
B for processing the images via Lambda as it's more cost efficient than EC2 spot instances
C for expiring images after 30 days and because the ML trainings are planned weeks in advance so S3 glacier is ideal for slow retrieval and cheap storage.
D and E uses S3 infrequent access which is more expensive than glacier

Question 370
A company has developed a new video game as a web application. The application is in a three-tier architecture in a VPC with Amazon RDS for MySQL in the database layer. Several players will compete concurrently online. The game’s developers want to display a top-10 scoreboard in near-real time and offer the ability to stop and restore the game while preserving the current scores.
What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements?
A.
Set up an Amazon ElastiCache for Memcached cluster to cache the scores for the web application to display.
B.
Set up an Amazon ElastiCache for Redis cluster to compute and cache the scores for the web application to display.
C.
Place an Amazon CloudFront distribution in front of the web application to cache the scoreboard in a section of the application.
D.
Create a read replica on Amazon RDS for MySQL to run queries to compute the scoreboard and serve the read traffic to the web application.

Answer: B

Explanation:
Redis provides fast in-memory data storage and processing. It can compute the top 10 scores and update the cache in milliseconds.
ElastiCache Redis supports sorting and ranking operations needed for the top 10 leaderboard.
The cached leaderboard can be retrieved from Redis vs hitting the MySQL database for every read. This reduces load on the database.
Redis supports persistence, so scores are preserved if the cache stops/restarts

B.
Create a custom trail in AWS CloudTrail to prevent tag modification.
C.
Create a service control policy (SCP) to prevent tag modification except by authorized principals.
D.
Create custom Amazon CloudWatch logs to prevent tag modification.

Answer: C

Explanation:
Tip: AWS Organziaton + service control policy (SCP) - This for any questions, you see both together. then you tell me
C. Create a service control policy (SCP) to prevent tag modification except by authorized principals.

Question 373
A company hosts its application in the AWS Cloud. The application runs on Amazon EC2 instances behind an Elastic Load Balancer in an Auto Scaling group and with an Amazon DynamoDB table. The company wants to ensure the application can be made available in anotherAWS Region with minimal downtime.
What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements with the LEAST amount of downtime?
A.
Create an Auto Scaling group and a load balancer in the disaster recovery Region. Configure the DynamoDB table as a global table. Configure DNS failover to point to the new disaster recovery Region's load balancer.
B.
Create an AWS CloudFormation template to create EC2 instances, load balancers, and DynamoDB tables to be launched when needed Configure DNS failover to point to the new disaster recovery Region's load balancer.
C.
Create an AWS CloudFormation template to create EC2 instances and a load balancer to be launched when needed. Configure the DynamoDB table as a global table. Configure DNS failover to point to the new disaster recovery Region's load balancer.
D.
Create an Auto Scaling group and load balancer in the disaster recovery Region. Configure the DynamoDB table as a global table. Create an Amazon CloudWatch alarm to trigger an AWS Lambda function that updates Amazon Route 53 pointing to the disaster recovery load balancer.

Answer: A?C?

Explanation:
A
A and D is correct.
But Route 53 haves a feature DNS failover when instances down so we dont need use Cloudwatch and lambda to trigger

C
There are 2 parts. DB and application. Dynamo DB recovery in another region is not possible without global table so option B is out.
A will make the infra available in 2 regions which is not required. The question is about DR, not scaling.
D Use Lambda to modify R53 to point to new region. This is going to cause delays but is possible and it will also be running a scaled EC2 instances in passive region.
C Make a CF template which can launch the infra when needed. DB is global table so it will be available.

Question 374
A company needs to migrate a MySQL database from its on-premises data center to AWS within 2 weeks. The database is 20 TB in size. The company wants to complete the migration with minimal downtime.
Which solution will migrate the database MOST cost-effectively?
A.
Order an AWS Snowball Edge Storage Optimized device. Use AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) with AWS Schema Conversion Tool (AWS SCT) to migrate the database with replication of ongoing changes. Send the Snowball Edge device to AWS to finish the migration and continue the ongoing replication.
B.
Order an AWS Snowmobile vehicle. Use AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) with AWS Schema Conversion Tool (AWS SCT) to migrate the database with ongoing changes. Send the Snowmobile vehicle back to AWS to finish the migration and continue the ongoing replication.
C.
Order an AWS Snowball Edge Compute Optimized with GPU device. Use AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) with AWS Schema Conversion Tool (AWS SCT) to migrate the database with ongoing changes. Send the Snowball device to AWS to finish the migration and continue the ongoing replication
D.
Order a 1 GB dedicated AWS Direct Connect connection to establish a connection with the data center. Use AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) with AWS Schema Conversion Tool (AWS SCT) to migrate the database with replication of ongoing changes.

Answer: A

Explanation:
Direct Connect takes at least 1 month to setup - D is invalid
AWS Snowmobile is used for transferring large amounts of data (petabytes) from remote locations where establishing a connection to the cloud is impossible - B is invalid
AWS Snowball Edge Compute Optimized provides higher vCPU performance and lower storage as compared to Snowball storage optimized. As our need is solely data transfer, high vCPU performance is not required but high storage is - C is invalid

Why not D.?
When you initiate the process by requesting an AWS Direct Connect connection, it typically starts with the AWS Direct Connect provider. This provider may need to coordinate with AWS to allocate the necessary resources. This initial setup phase can take anywhere from a few days to a couple of weeks.
Couple of weeks? No Good

Question 375
A company moved its on-premises PostgreSQL database to an Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance. The company successfully launched a new product. The workload on the database has increased. The company wants to accommodate the larger workload without adding infrastructure.
Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?
A.
Buy reserved DB instances for the total workload. Make the Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance larger.
B.
Make the Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance a Multi-AZ DB instance.
C.
Buy reserved DB instances for the total workload. Add another Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance.
D.
Make the Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance an on-demand DB instance.

Answer: A?B?

Explanation:
A
"without adding infrastructure" means scaling vertically and choosing larger instance.
"MOST cost-effectively" reserved instances

B
B is the best approach in this scenario overall:
Making the RDS PostgreSQL instance Multi-AZ adds a standby replica to handle larger workloads and provides high availability.
Even though it adds infrastructure, the cost is less than doubling the infrastructure with a separate DB instance.
It provides better performance, availability, and disaster recovery than a single larger instance.

Question 376
A company operates an ecommerce website on Amazon EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB) in an Auto Scaling group. The site is experiencing performance issues related to a high request rate from illegitimate external systems with changing IP addresses. The security team is worried about potential DDoS attacks against the website. The company must block the illegitimate incoming requests in a way that has a minimal impact on legitimate users.
What should a solutions architect recommend?
A.
Deploy Amazon Inspector and associate it with the ALB.
B.
Deploy AWS WAF, associate it with the ALB, and configure a rate-limiting rule.
C.
Deploy rules to the network ACLs associated with the ALB to block the incomingtraffic.
D.
Deploy Amazon GuardDuty and enable rate-limiting protection when configuring GuardDuty.

Answer: B

Explanation:
AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF) is a service that helps protect web applications from common web exploits and provides advanced security features. By deploying AWS WAF and associating it with the ALB, the company can set up rules to filter and block incoming requests based on specific criteria, such as IP addresses.
In this scenario, the company is facing performance issues due to a high request rate from illegitimate external systems with changing IP addresses. By configuring a rate-limiting rule in AWS WAF, the company can restrict the number of requests coming from each IP address, preventing excessive traffic from overwhelming the website. This will help mitigate the impact of potential DDoS attacks and ensure that legitimate users can access the site without interruption.

Question 377
A company wants to share accounting data with an external auditor. The data is stored in an Amazon RDS DB instance that resides in a private subnet. The auditor has its own AWS account and requires its own copy of the database.
What is the MOST secure way for the company to share the database with the auditor?
A.
Create a read replica of the database. Configure IAM standard database authentication to grant the auditor access.
B.
Export the database contents to text files. Store the files in an Amazon S3 bucket. Create a new IAM user for the auditor. Grant the user access to the S3 bucket.
C.
Copy a snapshot of the database to an Amazon S3 bucket. Create an IAM user. Share the user's keys with the auditor to grant access to the object in the S3 bucket.
D.
Create an encrypted snapshot of the database. Share the snapshot with the auditor. Allow access to the AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) encryption key.

Answer: D

Explanation:
Key word: "Secure way"
The snapshot contents are encrypted using KMS keys for data security.
Sharing the snapshot directly removes risks of extracting/transferring data.
The auditor can restore the snapshot into their own RDS instance.
Access is controlled through sharing the encrypted snapshot and KMS key.

Question 378
A solutions architect configured a VPC that has a small range of IP addresses. The number of Amazon EC2 instances that are in the VPC is increasing, and there is an insufficient number of IP addresses for future workloads.
Which solution resolves this issue with the LEAST operational overhead?
A.
Add an additional IPv4 CIDR block to increase the number of IP addresses and create additional subnets in the VPC. Create new resources in the new subnets by using the new CIDR.
B.
Create a second VPC with additional subnets. Use a peering connection to connect the second VPC with the first VPC Update the routes and create new resources in the subnets of the second VPC.
C.
Use AWS Transit Gateway to add a transit gateway and connect a second VPC with the first VPUpdate the routes of the transit gateway and VPCs. Create new resources in the subnets of the second VPC.
D.
Create a second VPC. Create a Site-to-Site VPN connection between the first VPC and the second VPC by using a VPN-hosted solution on Amazon EC2 and a virtual private gateway. Update the route between VPCs to the traffic through the VPN. Create new resources in the subnets of the second VPC.

Answer: A

Explanation:
You assign a single CIDR IP address range as the primary CIDR block when you create a VPC and can add up to four secondary CIDR blocks after creation of the VPC.

Question 379
A company has an Amazon S3 bucket that contains critical data. The company must protect the data from accidental deletion.
Which combination of steps should a solutions architect take to meet these requirements? (Choose two.)
A.
Enable versioning on the S3 bucket.
B.
Enable MFA Delete on the S3 bucket.
C.
Create a bucket policy on the S3 bucket.
D.
Enable default encryption on the S3 bucket.
E.
Create a lifecycle policy for the objects in the S3 bucket.

Answer: AB

Explanation:
Enabling versioning on S3 ensures multiple versions of object are stored in bucket. When object is updated or deleted, new version is created, preserving previous version.
Enabling MFA Delete adds additional layer of protection by requiring MFA device to be present when attempting to delete objects. This helps prevent accidental or unauthorized deletions by requiring extra level of authentication.
C. Creating a bucket policy on S3 is more focused on defining access control and permissions for bucket and its objects, rather than protecting against accidental deletion.
D. Enabling default encryption on S3 ensures that any new objects uploaded to bucket are automatically encrypted. While encryption is important for data security, it does not directly address accidental deletion.
E. Creating lifecycle policy for objects in S3 allows for automated management of objects based on predefined rules. While this can help with data retention and storage cost optimization, it does not directly protect against accidental deletion.

Question 380
A company used an Amazon RDS for MySQL DB instance during application testing. Before terminating the DB instance at the end of the test cycle, a solutions architect created two backups. The solutions architect created the first backup by using the mysqldump utility to create a database dump. The solutions architect created the second backup by enabling the final DB snapshot option on RDS termination.
The company is now planning for a new test cycle and wants to create a new DB instance from the most recent backup. The company has chosen a MySQL-compatible edition ofAmazon Aurora to host the DB instance.
Which solutions will create the new DB instance? (Choose two.)
A.
Import the RDS snapshot directly into Aurora.
B.
Upload the RDS snapshot to Amazon S3. Then import the RDS snapshot into Aurora.
C.
Upload the database dump to Amazon S3. Then import the database dump into Aurora.
D.
Use AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) to import the RDS snapshot into Aurora.
E.
Upload the database dump to Amazon S3. Then use AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) to import the database dump into Aurora.

Answer: AC?CE?

Explanation:
AC
A because the snapshot is already stored in AWS. 
C because you dont need a migration tool going from MySQL to MySQL. You would use the MySQL utility.

CE
C and E are the solutions that can restore the backups into Amazon Aurora.
The RDS DB snapshot contains backup data in a proprietary format that cannot be directly imported into Aurora.
The mysqldump database dump contains SQL statements that can be imported into Aurora after uploading to S3.
AWS DMS can migrate the dump file from S3 into Aurora.

Question 381
A company hosts a multi-tier web application on Amazon Linux Amazon EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer. The instances run in an Auto Scaling group across multiple Availability Zones. The company observes that the Auto Scaling group launches more On-Demand Instances when the application's end users access high volumes of static web content. The company wants to optimize cost.
What should a solutions architect do to redesign the application MOST cost-effectively?
A.
Update the Auto Scaling group to use Reserved Instances instead of On-Demand Instances.
B.
Update the Auto Scaling group to scale by launching Spot Instances instead of On-Demand Instances.
C.
Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution to host the static web contents from an Amazon S3 bucket.
D.
Create an AWS Lambda function behind an Amazon API Gateway API to host the static website contents.

Answer: C

Explanation:
By leveraging Amazon CloudFront, you can cache and serve the static web content from edge locations worldwide, reducing the load on your EC2 instances. This can help lower the number of On-Demand Instances required to handle high volumes of static web content requests. Storing the static content in an Amazon S3 bucket and using CloudFront as a content delivery network (CDN) improves performance and reduces costs by reducing the load on your EC2 instances.

Question 382
A company stores several petabytes of data across multiple AWS accounts. The company uses AWS Lake Formation to manage its data lake. The company's data science team wants to securely share selective data from its accounts with the company's engineering team for analytical purposes.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?
A.
Copy the required data to a common account. Create an IAM access role in that account. Grant access by specifying a permission policy that includes users from the engineering team accounts as trusted entities.
B.
Use the Lake Formation permissions Grant command in each account where the data is stored to allow the required engineering team users to access the data.
C.
Use AWS Data Exchange to privately publish the required data to the required engineering team accounts.
D.
Use Lake Formation tag-based access control to authorize and grant cross-account permissions for the required data to the engineering team accounts.

Answer: D

Explanation:
By utilizing Lake Formation's tag-based access control, you can define tags and tag-based policies to grant selective access to the required data for the engineering team accounts. This approach allows you to control access at a granular level without the need to copy or move the data to a common account or manage permissions individually in each account. It provides a centralized and scalable solution for securely sharing data across accounts with minimal operational overhead.

Question 383
A company wants to host a scalable web application on AWS. The application will be accessed by users from different geographic regions of the world. Application users will be able to download and upload unique data up to gigabytes in size. The development team wants a cost-effective solution to minimize upload and download latency and maximize performance.
What should a solutions architect do to accomplish this?
A.
Use Amazon S3 with Transfer Acceleration to host the application.
B.
Use Amazon S3 with CacheControl headers to host the application.
C.
Use Amazon EC2 with Auto Scaling and Amazon CloudFront to host the application.
D.
Use Amazon EC2 with Auto Scaling and Amazon ElastiCache to host the application.

Answer: A

Explanation:
The question asks for "a cost-effective solution [ONLY TO] to minimize upload and download latency and maximize performance", not for the actual application. And the 'cost-effective solution to minimize upload and download latency and maximize performance' is S3 Transfer Acceleration. Obviously there is more required to host the app, but that is not asked for.

Question 384

An employee recently deleted the DB instance, and the application was unavailable for 24 hours as a result. The company is concerned with the overall reliability of its environment.
What should the solutions architect do to maximize reliability of the application's infrastructure?
A.
Delete one EC2 instance and enable termination protection on the other EC2 instance. Update the DB instance to be Multi-AZ, and enable deletion protection.
B.
Update the DB instance to be Multi-AZ, and enable deletion protection. Place the EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer, and run them in an EC2 Auto Scaling group across multiple Availability Zones.
C.
Create an additional DB instance along with an Amazon API Gateway and an AWS Lambda function. Configure the application to invoke the Lambda function through API Gateway. Have the Lambda function write the data to the two DB instances.
D.
Place the EC2 instances in an EC2 Auto Scaling group that has multiple subnets located in multiple Availability Zones. Use Spot Instances instead of On-Demand Instances. Set up Amazon CloudWatch alarms to monitor the health of the instances Update the DB instance to be Multi-AZ, and enable deletion protection.

Answer: B

Explanation:
The key points:
° RDS Multi-AZ and deletion protection provide high availability for the database.
° The load balancer and Auto Scaling group across AZs give high availability for EC2.
° Options A, C, D have limitations that would reduce reliability vs option B.

Question 385
A company is storing 700 terabytes of data on a large network-attached storage (NAS) system in its corporate data center. The company has a hybrid environment with a 10 Gbps AWS Direct Connect connection.

Question 390
A company has a data ingestion workflow that consists of the following:
• An Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic for notifications about new data deliveries
• An AWS Lambda function to process the data and record metadata
The company observes that the ingestion workflow fails occasionally because of network connectivity issues. When such a failure occurs, the Lambda function does not ingest the corresponding data unless the company manually reruns the job.
Which combination of actions should a solutions architect take to ensure that the Lambda function ingests all data in the future? (Choose two.)
A.
Deploy the Lambda function in multiple Availability Zones.
B.
Create an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue, and subscribe it to the SNS topic.
C.
Increase the CPU and memory that are allocated to the Lambda function.
D.
Increase provisioned throughput for the Lambda function.
E.
Modify the Lambda function to read from an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue.

Answer: BE

Explanation:
A. Deploying the Lambda function in multiple Availability Zones improves availability and fault tolerance but does not guarantee ingestion of all data.
C. Increasing CPU and memory allocated to the Lambda function may improve its performance but does not address the issue of connectivity failures.
D. Increasing provisioned throughput for the Lambda function is not applicable as Lambda functions are automatically scaled by AWS and provisioned throughput is not configurable.
Therefore, the correct combination of actions to ensure that the Lambda function ingests all data in the future is to create an SQS queue and subscribe it to the SNS topic (option B) and modify the Lambda function to read from the SQS queue (option E).

Question 401
A company has an application that provides marketing services to stores. The services are based on previous purchases by store customers. The stores upload transaction data to the company through SFTP, and the data is processed and analyzed to generate new marketing offers. Some of the files can exceed 200 GB in size.
Recently, the company discovered that some of the stores have uploaded files that contain personally identifiable information (PII) that should not have been included. The company wants administrators to be alerted if PII is shared again. The company also wants to automate remediation.
What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements with the LEAST development effort?
A.
Use an Amazon S3 bucket as a secure transfer point. Use Amazon Inspector to scan the objects in the bucket. If objects contain PII, trigger an S3 Lifecycle policy to remove the objects that contain PII.
B.
Use an Amazon S3 bucket as a secure transfer point. Use Amazon Macie to scan the objects in the bucket. If objects contain PII, use Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) to trigger a notification to the administrators to remove the objects that contain PII.

If objects contain PII, use Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES) to trigger a notification to the administrators and trigger an S3 Lifecycle policy to remove the meats that contain PII.

Answer: B

Explanation:
Amazon Macie is a data security and data privacy service that uses machine learning (ML) and pattern matching to discover and protect your sensitive data

"Macie detects a potential issue with the security or privacy of your data, such as a bucket that becomes publicly accessible, Macie generates a finding for you to review and remediate as necessary" - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/macie/latest/user/what-is-macie.html

A. Using Amazon Inspector to scan the objects in S3 is not the optimal choice for scanning PII data. Amazon Inspector is designed for host-level vulnerability assessment rather than content scanning.
C. Implementing custom scanning algorithms in an AWS Lambda function would require significant development effort to handle scanning large files.
D. Using SES for notification and triggering S3 Lifecycle policy may add unnecessary complexity to the solution.
Therefore, the best option that meets the requirements with the least development effort is to use an S3 as a secure transfer point, utilize Amazon Macie for PII scanning, and trigger an SNS notification to the administrators (option B).

Question 404
A company has an application that processes customer orders. The company hosts the application on an Amazon EC2 instance that saves the orders to an Amazon Aurora database. Occasionally when traffic is high the workload does not process orders fast enough.
What should a solutions architect do to write the orders reliably to the database as quickly as possible?
A.
Increase the instance size of the EC2 instance when traffic is high. Write orders to Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS). Subscribe the database endpoint to the SNS topic.
B.
Write orders to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Use EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group behind an Application Load Balancer to read from the SQS queue and process orders into the database.
C.
Write orders to Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS). Subscribe the database endpoint to the SNS topic. Use EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group behind an Application Load Balancer to read from the SNS topic.
D.
Write orders to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue when the EC2 instance reaches CPU threshold limits. Use scheduled scaling of EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group behind an Application Load Balancer to read from the SQS queue and process orders into the database.

Answer: B

Explanation:
By decoupling the write operation from the processing operation using SQS, you ensure that the orders are reliably stored in the queue, regardless of the processing capacity of the EC2 instances. This allows the processing to be performed at a scalable rate based on the available EC2 instances, improving the overall reliability and speed of order processing.

D.
Place the RDS for PostgreSQL database in an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group with a minimum group size of two. Use Amazon Route 53 weighted record sets to distribute requests across instances.

Answer: A

Explanation:
https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/best-practices-for-converting-a-single-az-amazon-rds-instance-to-a-multi-az-instance/
The instance doesn't automatically convert to Multi-AZ immediately. By default it will convert at next maintenance window but you can convert it immediately. Compared to B this is much better. CD are too many changes overall so unsuitable.

Compared to other solutions that involve creating new instances, restoring snapshots, or setting up replication manually, converting to a Multi-AZ deployment is a simpler and more streamlined approach with lower overhead.
Overall, option A offers a cost-effective and efficient way to minimize database downtime without requiring significant changes or additional complexities.

Design a REST API by using Amazon API Gateway. Host the application in Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) in a private subnet. Create a private VPC link for API Gateway to access Amazon ECS.
C.
Design a WebSocket API by using Amazon API Gateway. Host the application in Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) in a private subnet. Create a security group for API Gateway to access Amazon ECS.
D.
Design a REST API by using Amazon API Gateway. Host the application in Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) in a private subnet. Create a security group for API Gateway to access Amazon ECS.

Answer: B

Explanation:
REST API with Amazon API Gateway: REST APIs are the appropriate choice for providing the frontend of the microservices application. Amazon API Gateway allows you to design, deploy, and manage REST APIs at scale.
Amazon ECS in a Private Subnet: Hosting the application in Amazon ECS in a private subnet ensures that the containers are securely deployed within the VPC and not directly exposed to the public internet.
Private VPC Link: To enable the REST API in API Gateway to access the backend services hosted in Amazon ECS, you can create a private VPC link. This establishes a private network connection between the API Gateway and ECS containers, allowing secure communication without traversing the public internet.

Question 412
A company needs guaranteed Amazon EC2 capacity in three specific Availability Zones in a specific AWS Region for an upcoming event that will last 1 week.
What should the company do to guarantee the EC2 capacity?
A.
Purchase Reserved Instances that specify the Region needed.
B.
Create an On-Demand Capacity Reservation that specifies the Region needed.
C.
Purchase Reserved Instances that specify the Region and three Availability Zones needed.
D.
Create an On-Demand Capacity Reservation that specifies the Region and three Availability Zones needed.

Answer: D

Explanation:
The most appropriate option to guarantee EC2 capacity in three specific Availability Zones in the desired AWS Region for the 1-week event is to create an On-Demand Capacity Reservation that specifies the Region and three Availability Zones (option D).
A. Purchasing Reserved Instances that specify the Region needed does not guarantee capacity in specific Availability Zones.
B. Creating an On-Demand Capacity Reservation without specifying the Availability Zones would not guarantee capacity in the desired zones.
C. Purchasing Reserved Instances that specify the Region and three Availability Zones is not necessary for a short-term event and involves longer-term commitments.

Question 413
A company has applications hosted on Amazon EC2 instances with IPv6 addresses. The applications must initiate communications with other external applications using the internet. However the company’s security policy states that any external service cannot initiate a connection to the EC2 instances.
What should a solutions architect recommend to resolve this issue?
A.
Create a NAT gateway and make it the destination of the subnet's route table
B.
Create an internet gateway and make it the destination of the subnet's route table
C.
Create a virtual private gateway and make it the destination of the subnet's route table
D.
Create an egress-only internet gateway and make it the destination of the subnet's route table

Answer: D

Explanation:
An egress-only internet gateway (EIGW) is specifically designed for IPv6-only VPCs and provides outbound IPv6 internet access while blocking inbound IPv6 traffic. It satisfies the requirement of preventing external services from initiating connections to the EC2 instances while allowing the instances to initiate outbound communications.

Since the company's security policy explicitly states that external services cannot initiate connections to the EC2 instances, using a NAT gateway (option A) would not be suitable. A NAT gateway allows outbound connections from private subnets to the internet, but it does not restrict inbound connections from external sources.

Question 414
A company is creating an application that runs on containers in a VPC. The application stores and accesses data in an Amazon S3 bucket. During the development phase, the application will store and access 1 TB of data in Amazon S3 each day. The company wants to minimize costs and wants to prevent traffic from traversing the internet whenever possible.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Enable S3 Intelligent-Tiering for the S3 bucket
B.
Enable S3 Transfer Acceleration for the S3 bucket
C.
Create a gateway VPC endpoint for Amazon S3. Associate this endpoint with all route tables in the VPC
D.
Create an interface endpoint for Amazon S3 in the VPC. Associate this endpoint with all route tables in the VPC

Answer: C

Explanation:
Gateway VPC Endpoint: A gateway VPC endpoint enables private connectivity between a VPC and Amazon S3. It allows direct access to Amazon S3 without the need for internet gateways, NAT devices, VPN connections, or AWS Direct Connect.
Minimize Internet Traffic: By creating a gateway VPC endpoint for Amazon S3 and associating it with all route tables in the VPC, the traffic between the VPC and Amazon S3 will be kept within the AWS network. This helps in minimizing data transfer costs and prevents the need for traffic to traverse the internet.
Cost-Effective: With a gateway VPC endpoint, the data transfer between the application running in the VPC and the S3 bucket stays within the AWS network, reducing the need for data transfer across the internet. This can result in cost savings, especially when dealing with large amounts of data.

Question 415
A company has a mobile chat application with a data store based in Amazon DynamoDB. Users would like new messages to be read with as little latency as possible. A solutions architect needs to design an optimal solution that requires minimal application changes.
Which method should the solutions architect select?
A.
Configure Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) for the new messages table. Update the code to use the DAX endpoint.
B.
Add DynamoDB read replicas to handle the increased read load. Update the application to point to the read endpoint for the read replicas.
C.
Double the number of read capacity units for the new messages table in DynamoDB. Continue to use the existing DynamoDB endpoint.
D.
Add an Amazon ElastiCache for Redis cache to the application stack. Update the application to point to the Redis cache endpoint instead of DynamoDB.

Answer: A

Explanation:
Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX): DAX is an in-memory cache for DynamoDB that provides low-latency access to frequently accessed data. By configuring DAX for the new messages table, read requests for the table will be served from the DAX cache, significantly reducing the latency.
Minimal Application Changes: With DAX, the application code can be updated to use the DAX endpoint instead of the standard DynamoDB endpoint. This change is relatively minimal and does not require extensive modifications to the application's data access logic.
Low Latency: DAX caches frequently accessed data in memory, allowing subsequent read requests for the same data to be served with minimal latency. This ensures that new messages can be read by users with minimal delay.

Question 416
A company hosts a website on Amazon EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB). The website serves static content. Website traffic is increasing, and the company is concerned about a potential increase in cost.
A.
Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution to cache state files at edge locations
B.
Create an Amazon ElastiCache cluster. Connect the ALB to the ElastiCache cluster to serve cached files
C.
Create an AWS WAF web ACL and associate it with the ALB. Add a rule to the web ACL to cache static files
D.
Create a second ALB in an alternative AWS Region. Route user traffic to the closest Region to minimize data transfer costs

Answer: A

Explanation:
Amazon CloudFront: CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) service that caches content at edge locations worldwide. By creating a CloudFront distribution, static content from the website can be cached at edge locations, reducing the load on the EC2 instances and improving the overall performance.
Caching Static Files: Since the website serves static content, caching these files at CloudFront edge locations can significantly reduce the number of requests forwarded to the EC2 instances. This helps to lower the overall cost by offloading traffic from the instances and reducing the data transfer costs.

Question 417
A company has multiple VPCs across AWS Regions to support and run workloads that are isolated from workloads in other Regions. Because of a recent application launch requirement, the company’s VPCs must communicate with all other VPCs across all Regions.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST amount of administrative effort?
A.
Use VPC peering to manage VPC communication in a single Region. Use VPC peering across Regions to manage VPC communications.
B.
Use AWS Direct Connect gateways across all Regions to connect VPCs across regions and manage VPC communications.
C.
Use AWS Transit Gateway to manage VPC communication in a single Region and Transit Gateway peering across Regions to manage VPC communications.
D.
Use AWS PrivateLink across all Regions to connect VPCs across Regions and manage VPC communications

Answer: C

Explanation:
AWS Transit Gateway is a network hub that you can use to connect your VPCs and on-premises networks. It provides a single point of control for managing your network traffic, and it can help you to reduce the number of connections that you need to manage.
Transit Gateway peering allows you to connect two Transit Gateways in different Regions. This can help you to create a global network that spans multiple Regions.
To use Transit Gateway to manage VPC communication in a single Region, you would create a Transit Gateway in each Region. You would then attach your VPCs to the Transit Gateway.
To use Transit Gateway peering to manage VPC communication across Regions, you would create a Transit Gateway peering connection between the Transit Gateways in each Region.

Question 418
A company is designing a containerized application that will use Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS). The application needs to access a shared file system that is highly durable and can recover data to another AWS Region with a recovery point objective (RPO) of 8 hours. The file system needs to provide a mount target m each Availability Zone within a Region.
A solutions architect wants to use AWS Backup to manage the replication to another Region.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Amazon FSx for Windows File Server with a Multi-AZ deployment
B.
Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP with a Multi-AZ deployment
C.
Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) with the Standard storage class
D.
Amazon FSx for OpenZFS

Answer: C

Explanation:
EFS Replication can replicate your file system data to another Region or within the same Region without requiring additional infrastructure or a custom process. Amazon EFS Replication automatically and transparently replicates your data to a second file system in a Region or AZ of your choice. You can use the Amazon EFS console, AWS CLI, and APIs to activate replication on an existing file system. EFS Replication is continual and provides a recovery point objective (RPO) and a recovery time objective (RTO) of minutes, helping you meet your compliance and business continuity goals.

Question 419
A company is expecting rapid growth in the near future. A solutions architect needs to configure existing users and grant permissions to new users on AWS. The solutions architect has decided to create IAM groups. The solutions architect will add the new users to IAM groups based on department.
Which additional action is the MOST secure way to grant permissions to the new users?
A.
Apply service control policies (SCPs) to manage access permissions
B.
Create IAM roles that have least privilege permission. Attach the roles to the IAM groups
C.
Create an IAM policy that grants least privilege permission. Attach the policy to the IAM groups
D.
Create IAM roles. Associate the roles with a permissions boundary that defines the maximum permissions

Answer: C

Explanation:
An IAM policy is an object in AWS that, when associated with an identity or resource, defines their permissions. Permissions in the policies determine whether a request is allowed or denied. You manage access in AWS by creating policies and attaching them to IAM identities (users, groups of users, or roles) or AWS resources.

Question 421
A law firm needs to share information with the public. The information includes hundreds of files that must be publicly readable. Modifications or deletions of the files by anyone before a designated future date are prohibited.
Which solution will meet these requirements in the MOST secure way?
A.
Upload all files to an Amazon S3 bucket that is configured for static website hosting. Grant read-only IAM permissions to any AWS principals that access the S3 bucket until the designated date.
B.
Create a new Amazon S3 bucket with S3 Versioning enabled. Use S3 Object Lock with a retention period in accordance with the designated date. Configure the S3 bucket for static website hosting. Set an S3 bucket policy to allow read-only access to the objects.
C.
Create a new Amazon S3 bucket with S3 Versioning enabled. Configure an event trigger to run an AWS Lambda function in case of object modification or deletion. Configure the Lambda function to replace the objects with the original versions from a private S3 bucket.
D.
Upload all files to an Amazon S3 bucket that is configured for static website hosting. Select the folder that contains the files. Use S3 Object Lock with a retention period in accordance with the designated date. Grant read-only IAM permissions to any AWS principals that access the S3 bucket.

Answer: B

Explanation:
Create a new Amazon S3 bucket with S3 Versioning enabled. Use S3 Object Lock with a retention period in accordance with the designated date. Configure the S3 bucket for static website hosting. Set an S3 bucket policy to allow read-only access to the objects.

Question 422
A company is making a prototype of the infrastructure for its new website by manually provisioning the necessary infrastructure. This infrastructure includes an Auto Scaling group, an Application Load Balancer and an Amazon RDS database. After the configuration has been thoroughly validated, the company wants the capability to immediately deploy the infrastructure for development and production use in two Availability Zones in an automated fashion.
What should a solutions architect recommend to meet these requirements?
A.
Use AWS Systems Manager to replicate and provision the prototype infrastructure in two Availability Zones
B.
Define the infrastructure as a template by using the prototype infrastructure as a guide. Deploy the infrastructure with AWS CloudFormation.
C.
Use AWS Config to record the inventory of resources that are used in the prototype infrastructure. Use AWS Config to deploy the prototype infrastructure into two Availability Zones.
D.
Use AWS Elastic Beanstalk and configure it to use an automated reference to the prototype infrastructure to automatically deploy new environments in two Availability Zones.

Answer: B

Explanation:
AWS CloudFormation is a service that allows you to define and provision infrastructure as code. This means that you can create a template that describes the resources you want to create, and then use CloudFormation to deploy those resources in an automated fashion.
In this case, the solutions architect should define the infrastructure as a template by using the prototype infrastructure as a guide. The template should include resources for an Auto Scaling group, an Application Load Balancer, and an Amazon RDS database. Once the template is created, the solutions architect can use CloudFormation to deploy the infrastructure in two Availability Zones.

Question 423
A company's website uses an Amazon EC2 instance store for its catalog of items. The company wants to make sure that the catalog is highly available and that the catalog is stored in a durable location.
What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements?
A.
Move the catalog to Amazon ElastiCache for Redis.
B.
Deploy a larger EC2 instance with a larger instance store.
C.
Move the catalog from the instance store to Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive.
D.
Move the catalog to an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file system.

Answer: D

Explanation:
The instance store on an EC2 instance is ephemeral storage that does not provide the durability or availability needed for the catalog.
Amazon EFS provides a scalable, high-performance file system that can be shared between EC2 instances. Data on EFS is stored redundantly across multiple Availability Zones, providing high durability and availability.
EFS is a better solution for the catalog storage than ElastiCache, S3 Glacier, or a larger EC2 instance store. Moving the catalog to EFS would meet the requirements for high availability and durable storage.

Question 424
A business application is hosted on Amazon EC2 and uses Amazon S3 for encrypted object storage. The chief information security officer has directed that no application traffic between the two services should traverse the public internet.
Which capability should the solutions architect use to meet the compliance requirements?
A.
AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS)
B.
VPC endpoint
C.
Private subnet
D.
Virtual private gateway

Answer: B

Explanation:
A VPC endpoint enables you to privately access AWS services without requiring internet gateways, NAT gateways, VPN connections, or AWS Direct Connect connections. It allows you to connect your VPC directly to supported AWS services, such as Amazon S3, over a private connection within the AWS network.
By creating a VPC endpoint for Amazon S3, the traffic between your EC2 instances and S3 will stay within the AWS network and won't traverse the public internet. This provides a more secure and compliant solution, as the data transfer remains within the private network boundaries.

Question 425
A company hosts a three-tier web application in the AWS Cloud. A Multi-AZAmazon RDS for MySQL server forms the database layer Amazon ElastiCache forms the cache layer. The company wants a caching strategy that adds or updates data in the cache when a customer adds an item to the database. The data in the cache must always match the data in the database.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Implement the lazy loading caching strategy
B.
Implement the write-through caching strategy
C.
Implement the adding TTL caching strategy
D.
Implement the AWS AppConfig caching strategy

Answer: B

Explanation:
In the write-through caching strategy, when a customer adds or updates an item in the database, the application first writes the data to the database and then updates the cache with the same data. This ensures that the cache is always synchronized with the database, as every write operation triggers an update to the cache.

Lazy loading caching strategy (option A) typically involves populating the cache only when data is requested, and it does not guarantee that the data in the cache always matches the data in the database.
Adding TTL (Time-to-Live) caching strategy (option C) involves setting an expiration time for cached data. It is useful for scenarios where the data can be considered valid for a specific period, but it does not guarantee that the data in the cache is always in sync with the database.
AWS AppConfig caching strategy (option D) is a service that helps you deploy and manage application configurations. It is not specifically designed for caching data synchronization between a database and cache layer.

Question 426
A company wants to migrate 100 GB of historical data from an on-premises location to an Amazon S3 bucket. The company has a 100 megabits per second (Mbps) internet connection on premises. The company needs to encrypt the data in transit to the S3 bucket. The company will store new data directly in Amazon S3.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?
A.
Use the s3 sync command in the AWS CLI to move the data directly to an S3 bucket
B.
Use AWS DataSync to migrate the data from the on-premises location to an S3 bucket
C.
Use AWS Snowball to move the data to an S3 bucket
D.
Set up an IPsec VPN from the on-premises location to AWS. Use the s3 cp command in the AWS CLI to move the data directly to an S3 bucket

Answer: A?B?

Explanation:
A
Option A meets all the requirements with the LEAST operational overhead (while option B will introduce unnecessary complexity for a one-time transfer). The data will be encrypted in transit (via HTTPS), and a 100 Mbps connection is sufficient to transfer data of 100 GB.
If the task involves periodic transfers or error recovery, DataSync (option B) could be considered as an alternative.

B
AWS DataSync is a fully managed data transfer service that simplifies and automates the process of moving data between on-premises storage and Amazon S3. It provides secure and efficient data transfer with built-in encryption, ensuring that the data is encrypted in transit.
By using AWS DataSync, the company can easily migrate the 100 GB of historical data from their on-premises location to an S3 bucket. DataSync will handle the encryption of data in transit and ensure secure transfer.

Question 427
A company containerized a Windows job that runs on .NET 6 Framework under a Windows container. The company wants to run this job in the AWS Cloud. The job runs every 10 minutes. The job’s runtime varies between 1 minute and 3 minutes.
Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?
A.
Create an AWS Lambda function based on the container image of the job. Configure Amazon EventBridge to invoke the function every 10 minutes.
B.
Use AWS Batch to create a job that uses AWS Fargate resources. Configure the job scheduling to run every 10 minutes.
C.
Use Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) on AWS Fargate to run the job. Create a scheduled task based on the container image of the job to run every 10 minutes.
D.
Use Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) on AWS Fargate to run the job. Create a standalone task based on the container image of the job. Use Windows task scheduler to run the job every 10 minutes.

Answer: C

Explanation:
I guess this is an old question from before August 2023, when AWS Batch did not support Windows containers, while ECS already did since September 2021. Thus it would be C, though now B does also work. Since both Batch and ECS are free, we'd pay only for the Fargate resources (which are identical in both cases), now B and C would be correct.
A doesn't work because Lambda still does not support Windows containeres.
D doesn't make sense because the container would have to run 24/7

Question 428
A company wants to move from many standalone AWS accounts to a consolidated, multi-account architecture. The company plans to create many new AWS accounts for different business units. The company needs to authenticate access to these AWS accounts by using a centralized corporate directory service.
Which combination of actions should a solutions architect recommend to meet these requirements? (Choose two.)
A.
Create a new organization in AWS Organizations with all features turned on. Create the new AWS accounts in the organization.
B.
Set up an Amazon Cognito identity pool. Configure AWS IAM Identity Center (AWS Single Sign-On) to accept Amazon Cognito authentication.
C.
Configure a service control policy (SCP) to manage the AWS accounts. Add AWS IAM Identity Center (AWS Single Sign-On) to AWS Directory Service.
D.
Create a new organization in AWS Organizations. Configure the organization's authentication mechanism to use AWS Directory Service directly.
E.
Set up AWS IAM Identity Center (AWS Single Sign-On) in the organization. Configure IAM Identity Center, and integrate it with the company's corporate directory service.

Answer: AE

Explanation:
A. By creating a new organization in AWS Organizations, you can establish a consolidated multi-account architecture. This allows you to create and manage multiple AWS accounts for different business units under a single organization.
E. Setting up AWS IAM Identity Center (AWS Single Sign-On) within the organization enables you to integrate it with the company's corporate directory service. This integration allows for centralized authentication, where users can sign in using their corporate credentials and access the AWS accounts within the organization.
Together, these actions create a centralized, multi-account architecture that leverages AWS Organizations for account management and AWS IAM Identity Center (AWS Single Sign-On) for authentication and access control.

Question 429
A company is looking for a solution that can store video archives in AWS from old news footage. The company needs to minimize costs and will rarely need to restore these files. When the files are needed, they must be available in a maximum of five minutes.
What is the MOST cost-effective solution?
A.
Store the video archives in Amazon S3 Glacier and use Expedited retrievals.
B.
Store the video archives in Amazon S3 Glacier and use Standard retrievals.
C.
Store the video archives in Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA).
D.
Store the video archives in Amazon S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA).

Answer: A

Explanation:
By choosing Expedited retrievals in Amazon S3 Glacier, you can reduce the retrieval time to minutes, making it suitable for scenarios where quick access is required. Expedited retrievals come with a higher cost per retrieval compared to standard retrievals but provide faster access to your archived data.

B.
Use Amazon CloudFront to host static content. Use Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) with Amazon EC2 for compute power. Use a managed Amazon RDS cluster for the database.
C.
Use Amazon S3 to host static content. Use Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) with AWS Fargate for compute power. Use a managed Amazon RDS cluster for the database.
D.
Use Amazon EC2 Reserved Instances to host static content. Use Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) with Amazon EC2 for compute power. Use a managed Amazon RDS cluster for the database.

Answer: A

Explanation:
B: CloudFront = Extra cost for something they don't want (CDN)
C: Kubernetes is more operationally complex than ECS containers on Fargate.
D: EC2 expensive
A: S3 is cheap for static content. ECS with Fargate is easiest implantation. Managed RDS is very low op overhead

Question 431
A company seeks a storage solution for its application. The solution must be highly available and scalable. The solution also must function as a file system be mountable by multiple Linux instances in AWS and on premises through native protocols, and have no minimum size requirements. The company has set up a Site-to-Site VPN for access from its on-premises network to its VPC.
Which storage solution meets these requirements?
A.
Amazon FSx Multi-AZ deployments
B.
Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) Multi-Attach volumes
C.
Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) with multiple mount targets
D.
Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) with a single mount target and multiple access points

Answer: C

Explanation:
Amazon EFS is a fully managed file system service that provides scalable, shared storage for Amazon EC2 instances. It supports the Network File System version 4 (NFSv4) protocol, which is a native protocol for Linux-based systems. EFS is designed to be highly available, durable, and scalable.

A. Amazon FSx Multi-AZ deployments Amazon FSx is a managed file system service that provides access to file systems that are hosted on Amazon EC2 instances. Amazon FSx does not support native protocols, such as NFS.
B. Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) Multi-Attach volumes Amazon EBS is a block storage service that provides durable, block-level storage volumes for use with Amazon EC2 instances. Amazon EBS Multi-Attach volumes can be attached to multiple EC2 instances at the same time, but they cannot be mounted by multiple Linux instances through native protocols, such as NFS.
D. Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) with a single mount target and multiple access points A single mount target can only be used to mount the file system on a single EC2 instance. Multiple access points are used to provide access to the file system from different VPCs.

Question 432
A 4-year-old media company is using the AWS Organizations all features feature set to organize its AWS accounts. According to the company's finance team, the billing information on the member accounts must not be accessible to anyone, including the root user of the member accounts.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Add all finance team users to an IAM group. Attach an AWS managed policy named Billing to the group.
B.
Attach an identity-based policy to deny access to the billing information to all users, including the root user.
C.
Create a service control policy (SCP) to deny access to the billing information. Attach the SCP to the root organizational unit (OU).
D.
Convert from the Organizations all features feature set to the Organizations consolidated billing feature set.

Answer: C

Explanation:
Service Control Policies (SCP): SCPs are an integral part of AWS Organizations and allow you to set fine-grained permissions on the organizational units (OUs) within your AWS Organization. SCPs provide central control over the maximum permissions that can be granted to member accounts, including the root user.
Denying Access to Billing Information: By creating an SCP and attaching it to the root OU, you can explicitly deny access to billing information for all accounts within the organization. SCPs can be used to restrict access to various AWS services and actions, including billing-related services.
Granular Control: SCPs enable you to define specific permissions and restrictions at the organizational unit level. By denying access to billing information at the root OU, you can ensure that no member accounts, including root users, have access to the billing information.

Question 433
An ecommerce company runs an application in the AWS Cloud that is integrated with an on-premises warehouse solution. The company uses Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) to send order messages to an on-premises HTTPS endpoint so the warehouse application can process the orders. The local data center team has detected that some of the order messages were not received.
A solutions architect needs to retain messages that are not delivered and analyze the messages for up to 14 days.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST development effort?
A.
Configure an Amazon SNS dead letter queue that has an Amazon Kinesis Data Stream target with a retention period of 14 days.
B.
Add an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue with a retention period of 14 days between the application and Amazon SNS.
C.
Configure an Amazon SNS dead letter queue that has an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) target with a retention period of 14 days.
D.
Configure an Amazon SNS dead letter queue that has an Amazon DynamoDB target with a TTL attribute set for a retention period of 14 days.

Answer: C

Explanation:
"Configuring an Amazon SNS dead-letter queue for a subscription ... 
A dead-letter queue is an Amazon SQS queue that an Amazon SNS subscription can target for messages that can't be delivered to subscribers successfully", this is exactly what C says. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-configure-dead-letter-queue.html
B, an SQS queue "between the application and Amazon SNS" would change the application logic. SQS cannot push messages to the "on-premises https endpoint", rather the destination would have to retrieve messages from the queue. Besides, option B would eventually deliver the messages that failed on the first attempt, which is NOT what is asked for. The goal is to retain undeliverable messages for analysis (NOT to deliver them), and this is typically achieved with a dead letter queue.

Question 434
A company stores call transcript files on a monthly basis. Users access the files randomly within 1 year of the call, but users access the files infrequently after 1 year. The company wants to optimize its solution by giving users the ability to query and retrieve files that are less than 1-year-old as quickly as possible. A delay in retrieving older files is acceptable.
Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?
A.
Store individual files with tags in Amazon S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval. Query the tags to retrieve the files from S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval.
B.
Store individual files in Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering. Use S3 Lifecycle policies to move the files to S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval after 1 year. Query and retrieve the files that are in Amazon S3 by using Amazon Athena. Query and retrieve the files that are in S3 Glacier by using S3 Glacier Select.
C.
Store individual files with tags in Amazon S3 Standard storage. Store search metadata for each archive in Amazon S3 Standard storage. Use S3 Lifecycle policies to move the files to S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval after 1 year. Query and retrieve the files by searching for metadata from Amazon S3.
D.
Store individual files in Amazon S3 Standard storage. Use S3 Lifecycle policies to move the files to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 1 year. Store search metadata in Amazon RDS. Query the files from Amazon RDS. Retrieve the files from S3 Glacier Deep Archive.

Answer: B

Explanation:
Users access the files randomly
S3 Intelligent-Tiering is the ideal storage class for data with unknown, changing, or unpredictable access patterns, independent of object size or retention period. You can use S3 Intelligent-Tiering as the default storage class for virtually any workload, especially data lakes, data analytics, new applications, and user-generated content.

Question 435
A gaming company uses Amazon DynamoDB to store user information such as geographic location, player data, and leaderboards. The company needs to configure continuous backups to an Amazon S3 bucket with a minimal amount of coding. The backups must not affect availability of the application and must not affect the read capacity units (RCUs) that are defined for the table.
Which solution meets these requirements?
A.
Use an Amazon EMR cluster. Create an Apache Hive job to back up the data to Amazon S3.
B.
Export the data directly from DynamoDB to Amazon S3 with continuous backups. Turn on point-in-time recovery for the table.
C.
Configure Amazon DynamoDB Streams. Create an AWS Lambda function to consume the stream and export the data to an Amazon S3 bucket.
D.
Create an AWS Lambda function to export the data from the database tables to Amazon S3 on a regular basis. Turn on point-in-time recovery for the table.

Answer: B

Explanation:
Continuous Backups: DynamoDB provides a feature called continuous backups, which automatically backs up your table data. Enabling continuous backups ensures that your table data is continuously backed up without the need for additional coding or manual interventions.
Export to Amazon S3: With continuous backups enabled, DynamoDB can directly export the backups to an Amazon S3 bucket. This eliminates the need for custom coding to export the data.
Minimal Coding: Option B requires the least amount of coding effort as continuous backups and the export to Amazon S3 functionality are built-in features of DynamoDB.
No Impact on Availability and RCUs: Enabling continuous backups and exporting data to Amazon S3 does not affect the availability of your application or the read capacity units (RCUs) defined for the table. These operations happen in the background and do not impact the table's performance or consume additional RCUs.

Question 436
A solutions architect is designing an asynchronous application to process credit card data validation requests for a bank. The application must be secure and be able to process each request at least once.
Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?
A.
Use AWS Lambda event source mapping. Set Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) standard queues as the event source. Use AWS Key Management Service (SSE-KMS) for encryption. Add the kms:Decrypt permission for the Lambda execution role.
B.
Use AWS Lambda event source mapping. Use Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) FIFO queues as the event source. Use SQS managed encryption keys (SSE-SQS) for encryption. Add the encryption key invocation permission for the Lambda function.
C.
Use the AWS Lambda event source mapping. Set Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) FIFO queues as the event source. Use AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS). Add the kms:Decrypt permission for the Lambda execution role.
D.
Use the AWS Lambda event source mapping. Set Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) standard queues as the event source. Use AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS) for encryption. Add the encryption key invocation permission for the Lambda function.

Answer: A?B?

Explanation:
A
SQS FIFO is slightly more expensive than standard queue
https://calculator.aws/#/addService/SQS
I would still go with the standard because of the keyword "at least once" because FIFO process "exactly once". That leaves us with A and D, I believe that lambda function only needs to decrypt so I would choose A

B
Using SQS FIFO queues ensures each message is processed at least once in order. SSE-SQS provides encryption that is handled entirely by SQS without needing decrypt permissions.
Standard SQS queues (Options A and D) do not guarantee order.
Using KMS keys (Options C and D) requires providing the Lambda role with decrypt permissions, adding complexity.
SQS FIFO queues with SSE-SQS encryption provide orderly, secure, server-side message processing that Lambda can consume without needing to manage decryption. This is the most efficient and cost-effective approach.

Question 437
A company has multiple AWS accounts for development work. Some staff consistently use oversized Amazon EC2 instances, which causes the company to exceed the yearly budget for the development accounts. The company wants to centrally restrict the creation of AWS resources in these accounts.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST development effort?
A.
Develop AWS Systems Manager templates that use an approved EC2 creation process. Use the approved Systems Manager templates to provision EC2 instances.
B.
Use AWS Organizations to organize the accounts into organizational units (OUs). Define and attach a service control policy (SCP) to control the usage of EC2 instance types.
C.
Configure an Amazon EventBridge rule that invokes an AWS Lambda function when an EC2 instance is created. Stop disallowed EC2 instance types.
D.
Set up AWS Service Catalog products for the staff to create the allowed EC2 instance types. Ensure that staff can deploy EC2 instances only by using the Service Catalog products.

Answer: B

Explanation:
AWS Organizations: AWS Organizations is a service that helps you centrally manage multiple AWS accounts. It enables you to group accounts into organizational units (OUs) and apply policies across those accounts.
Service Control Policies (SCPs): SCPs in AWS Organizations allow you to define fine-grained permissions and restrictions at the account or OU level. By attaching an SCP to the development accounts, you can control the creation and usage of EC2 instance types.
Least Development Effort: Option B requires minimal development effort as it leverages the built-in features of AWS Organizations and SCPs. You can define the SCP to restrict the use of oversized EC2 instance types and apply it to the appropriate OUs or accounts.

A company is conducting an internal audit. The company wants to ensure that the data in an Amazon S3 bucket that is associated with the company’s AWS Lake Formation data lake does not contain sensitive customer or employee data. The company wants to discover personally identifiable information (PII) or financial information, including passport numbers and credit card numbers.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Configure AWS Audit Manager on the account. Select the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS) for auditing.
B.
Configure Amazon S3 Inventory on the S3 bucket Configure Amazon Athena to query the inventory.
C.
Configure Amazon Macie to run a data discovery job that uses managed identifiers for the required data types.
D.
Use Amazon S3 Select to run a report across the S3 bucket.

Answer: C

Explanation:
Amazon Macie is a service that helps discover, classify, and protect sensitive data stored in AWS. It uses machine learning algorithms and managed identifiers to detect various types of sensitive information, including personally identifiable information (PII) and financial information. By configuring Amazon Macie to run a data discovery job with the appropriate managed identifiers for the required data types (such as passport numbers and credit card numbers), the company can identify and classify any sensitive data present in the S3 bucket.

Question 441

Question 442
A company has a service that reads and writes large amounts of data from an Amazon S3 bucket in the same AWS Region. The service is deployed on Amazon EC2 instances within the private subnet of a VPC. The service communicates with Amazon S3 over a NAT gateway in the public subnet. However, the company wants a solution that will reduce the data output costs.
Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?
A.
Provision a dedicated EC2 NAT instance in the public subnet. Configure the route table for the private subnet to use the elastic network interface of this instance as the destination for all S3 traffic.
B.
Provision a dedicated EC2 NAT instance in the private subnet. Configure the route table for the public subnet to use the elastic network interface of this instance as the destination for all S3 traffic.
C.
Provision a VPC gateway endpoint. Configure the route table for the private subnet to use the gateway endpoint as the route for all S3 traffic.
D.
Provision a second NAT gateway. Configure the route table for the private subnet to use this NAT gateway as the destination for all S3 traffic.

Answer: C

Explanation:
A VPC gateway endpoint allows you to privately access Amazon S3 from within your VPC without using a NAT gateway or NAT instance. By provisioning a VPC gateway endpoint for S3, the service in the private subnet can directly communicate with S3 without incurring data transfer costs for traffic going through a NAT gateway.

Question 443
A company uses Amazon S3 to store high-resolution pictures in an S3 bucket. To minimize application changes, the company stores the pictures as the latest version of an S3 object. The company needs to retain only the two most recent versions of the pictures.
The company wants to reduce costs. The company has identified the S3 bucket as a large expense.
Which solution will reduce the S3 costs with the LEAST operational overhead?
A.
Use S3 Lifecycle to delete expired object versions and retain the two most recent versions.
B.
Use an AWS Lambda function to check for older versions and delete all but the two most recent versions.
C.
Use S3 Batch Operations to delete noncurrent object versions and retain only the two most recent versions.
D.
Deactivate versioning on the S3 bucket and retain the two most recent versions.

Answer: A

Explanation:
S3 Lifecycle policies allow you to define rules that automatically transition or expire objects based on their age or other criteria. By configuring an S3 Lifecycle policy to delete expired object versions and retain only the two most recent versions, you can effectively manage the storage costs while maintaining the desired retention policy. This solution is highly automated and requires minimal operational overhead as the lifecycle management is handled by S3 itself.

Question 444
A company needs to minimize the cost of its 1 Gbps AWS Direct Connect connection. The company's average connection utilization is less than 10%. A solutions architect must recommend a solution that will reduce the cost without compromising security.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Set up a new 1 Gbps Direct Connect connection. Share the connection with another AWS account.
B.
Set up a new 200 Mbps Direct Connect connection in the AWS Management Console.
C.
Contact an AWS Direct Connect Partner to order a 1 Gbps connection. Share the connection with another AWS account.
D.
Contact an AWS Direct Connect Partner to order a 200 Mbps hosted connection for an existing AWS account.

Answer: B?D?

Explanation:
B
If you already have an existing AWS Direct Connect connection configured at 1 Gbps, and you wish to reduce the connection bandwidth to 200 Mbps to minimize costs, you should indeed contact your AWS Direct Connect Partner and request to lower the connection speed to 200 Mbps.

D
No, you cannot directly adjust the speed of an existing Direct Connect connection through the AWS Management Console.
To adjust the speed of an existing Direct Connect connection, you typically need to contact your Direct Connect service provider. They can assist you in modifying the speed of your connection based on your requirements. Depending on the provider, this process may involve submitting a request or contacting their support team to initiate the necessary changes. Keep in mind that adjusting the speed of your Direct Connect connection may also involve contractual and billing considerations.

Question 445
A company is hosting a web application on AWS using a single Amazon EC2 instance that stores user-uploaded documents in an Amazon EBS volume. For better scalability and availability, the company duplicated the architecture and created a second EC2 instance and EBS volume in another Availability Zone, placing both behind an Application Load Balancer. After completing this change, users reported that, each time they refreshed the website, they could see one subset of their documents or the other, but never all of the documents at the same time.
What should a solutions architect propose to ensure users see all of their documents at once?
A.
Copy the data so both EBS volumes contain all the documents
B.
Configure the Application Load Balancer to direct a user to the server with the documents
C.
Copy the data from both EBS volumes to Amazon EFS. Modify the application to save new documents to Amazon EFS
D.
Configure the Application Load Balancer to send the request to both servers. Return each document from the correct server

Answer: C

Explanation:
The current architecture is using two separate EBS volumes, one for each EC2 instance. This means that each instance only has a subset of the documents. When a user refreshes the website, the Application Load Balancer will randomly direct them to one of the two instances. If the user's documents are not on the instance that they are directed to, they will not be able to see them.

Question 446
A company has a production workload that runs on 1,000 Amazon EC2 Linux instances. The workload is powered by third-party software. The company needs to patch the third-party software on all EC2 instances as quickly as possible to remediate a critical security vulnerability.
What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements?
A.
Create an AWS Lambda function to apply the patch to all EC2 instances.
B.
Configure AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to apply the patch to all EC2 instances.
C.
Schedule an AWS Systems Manager maintenance window to apply the patch to all EC2 instances.
D.
Use AWS Systems Manager Run Command to run a custom command that applies the patch to all EC2 instances.

Answer: B?D?

Explanation:
B
SSM Patch Manager offers a centralized and automated approach to patch management, allowing administrators to efficiently manage patching operations across a large number of instances. It provides features such as patch compliance reporting and ability to specify maintenance windows to control timing of patch installations.
A suggests using an Lambda to apply the patch. It requires additional development effort to create and manage it, handle error handling and retries, and scale solution appropriately to handle a large number of instances.
C suggests scheduling an SSM maintenance window. While it can be used to orchestrate patching activities, they may not provide fastest patching time for all instances, as execution is scheduled within defined maintenance window timeframe.
D suggests using Run Command to run a custom command for patching. While it can be used for executing commands on multiple instances, it requires manual execution and may not provide the scalability and automation capabilities that Patch Manager offers.

D
AWS Systems Manager Run Command allows the company to run commands or scripts on multiple EC2 instances. By using Run Command, the company can quickly and easily apply the patch to all 1,000 EC2 instances to remediate the security vulnerability.
Creating an AWS Lambda function to apply the patch to all EC2 instances would not be a suitable solution, as Lambda functions are not designed to run on EC2 instances. Configuring AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to apply the patch to all EC2 instances would not be a suitable solution, as Patch Manager is not designed to apply third-party software patches. Scheduling an AWS Systems Manager maintenance window to apply the patch to all EC2 instances would not be a suitable solution, as maintenance windows are not designed to apply patches to third-party software

Question 447
A company has multiple Windows file servers on premises. The company wants to migrate and consolidate its files into an Amazon FSx for Windows File Server file system. File permissions must be preserved to ensure that access rights do not change.

E.
Order an AWS Snowball Edge Storage Optimized device. Connect the device to the on-premises network. Copy data to the device by using the AWS CLI. Ship the device back to AWS for import into Amazon S3. Schedule AWS DataSync tasks to transfer the data to the FSx for Windows File Server file system.

Answer: AD

Explanation:
A This option involves deploying DataSync agents on your on-premises file servers and using DataSync to transfer the data directly to the FSx for Windows File Server. DataSync ensures that file permissions are preserved during the migration process.
D
This option involves using an AWS Snowcone device, a portable data transfer device. You would connect the Snowcone device to your on-premises network, launch DataSync agents on the device, and schedule DataSync tasks to transfer the data to FSx for Windows File Server. DataSync handles the migration process while preserving file permissions.

Question 448

A.
Use Amazon Kinesis Data Streams to ingest data. Use AWS Lambda to analyze the data in real time.
B.
Use AWS Glue to ingest data. Use Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics to analyze the data in real time.
C.
Use Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose to ingest data. Use Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics to analyze the data in real time.
D.
Use Amazon API Gateway to ingest data. Use AWS Lambda to analyze the data in real time.

Answer: C

Explanation:
By leveraging the combination of Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose and Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics, you can efficiently ingest and analyze the payment data in real time without the need for manual processing or additional infrastructure management. This solution provides a streamlined and scalable approach to handle continuous data ingestion and analysis requirements.

Kinesis Firehouse = ingesting
Kinesis Datastreams = storing
Kinesis analytics = doing analysis

Question 449
A company runs a website that uses a content management system (CMS) on Amazon EC2. The CMS runs on a single EC2 instance and uses an Amazon Aurora MySQL Multi-AZ DB instance for the data tier. Website images are stored on an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume that is mounted inside the EC2 instance.
Which combination of actions should a solutions architect take to improve the performance and resilience of the website? (Choose two.)
A.
Move the website images into an Amazon S3 bucket that is mounted on every EC2 instance
B.
Share the website images by using an NFS share from the primary EC2 instance. Mount this share on the other EC2 instances.
C.
Move the website images onto an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file system that is mounted on every EC2 instance.
D.
Create an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) from the existing EC2 instance. Use the AMI to provision new instances behind an Application Load Balancer as part of an Auto Scaling group. Configure the Auto Scaling group to maintain a minimum of two instances. Configure an accelerator in AWS Global Accelerator for the website
E.
Create an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) from the existing EC2 instance. Use the AMI to provision new instances behind an Application Load Balancer as part of an Auto Scaling group. Configure the Auto Scaling group to maintain a minimum of two instances. Configure an Amazon CloudFront distribution for the website.

Answer: AE?CE?

Explanation:
AE
You have summarized the reasons why options A and E are the best choices very well.
Migrating static website assets like images to Amazon S3 enables high scalability, durability and shared access across instances. This improves performance.
Using Auto Scaling with load balancing provides elasticity and resilience. Adding a CloudFront distribution further boosts performance through caching and content delivery.

CE
First of all you should understand, a website using CMS is a dynamic one not static, so A is out, B is more complicated than C, so C, and between global accelerator and cloudfront, Cloudfront suits better as there is no legacy protocols data(UDP, etc) that needs to be accessed, hence E

Question 450
A company runs an infrastructure monitoring service. The company is building a new feature that will enable the service to monitor data in customer AWS accounts. The new feature will call AWS APIs in customer accounts to describe Amazon EC2 instances and read Amazon CloudWatch metrics.
What should the company do to obtain access to customer accounts in the MOST secure way?
A.
Ensure that the customers create an IAM role in their account with read-only EC2 and CloudWatch permissions and a trust policy to the company’s account.
B.
Create a serverless API that implements a token vending machine to provide temporary AWS credentials for a role with read-only EC2 and CloudWatch permissions.
C.
Ensure that the customers create an IAM user in their account with read-only EC2 and CloudWatch permissions. Encrypt and store customer access and secret keys in a secrets management system.
D.
Ensure that the customers create an Amazon Cognito user in their account to use an IAM role with read-only EC2 and CloudWatch permissions. Encrypt and store the Amazon Cognito user and password in a secrets management system.

Answer: A

Explanation:
By having customers create an IAM role with the necessary permissions in their own accounts, the company can use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to establish cross-account access. The trust policy allows the company's AWS account to assume the customer's IAM role temporarily, granting access to the specified resources (EC2 instances and CloudWatch metrics) within the customer's account. This approach follows the principle of least privilege, as the company only requests the necessary permissions and does not require long-term access keys or user credentials from the customers.

Question 451
A company needs to connect several VPCs in the us-east-1 Region that span hundreds of AWS accounts. The company's networking team has its own AWS account to manage the cloud network.
What is the MOST operationally efficient solution to connect the VPCs?
A.
Set up VPC peering connections between each VPC. Update each associated subnet’s route table
B.
Configure a NAT gateway and an internet gateway in each VPC to connect each VPC through the internet
C.
Create an AWS Transit Gateway in the networking team’s AWS account. Configure static routes from each VPC.
D.
Deploy VPN gateways in each VPC. Create a transit VPC in the networking team’s AWS account to connect to each VPC.

Answer: C

Explanation:
The main difference between AWS Transit Gateway and VPC peering is that AWS Transit Gateway is designed to connect multiple VPCs together in a hub-and-spoke model, while VPC peering is designed to connect two VPCs together in a peer-to-peer model.
As we have several VPCs here, the answer should be C.

Question 452
A company has Amazon EC2 instances that run nightly batch jobs to process data. The EC2 instances run in an Auto Scaling group that uses On-Demand billing. If a job fails on one instance, another instance will reprocess the job. The batch jobs run between 12:00 AM and 06:00 AM local time every day.
Which solution will provide EC2 instances to meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?
A.
Purchase a 1-year Savings Plan for Amazon EC2 that covers the instance family of the Auto Scaling group that the batch job uses.
B.
Purchase a 1-year Reserved Instance for the specific instance type and operating system of the instances in the Auto Scaling group that the batch job uses.
C.
Create a new launch template for the Auto Scaling group. Set the instances to Spot Instances. Set a policy to scale out based on CPU usage.
D.
Create a new launch template for the Auto Scaling group. Increase the instance size. Set a policy to scale out based on CPU usage.

Answer: C

Explanation:
Purchasing a 1-year Savings Plan (option A) or a 1-year Reserved Instance (option B) may provide cost savings, but they are more suitable for long-running, steady-state workloads. Since your batch jobs run for a specific period each day, using Spot Instances with the ability to scale out based on CPU usage is a more cost-effective choice.

Question 453
A social media company is building a feature for its website. The feature will give users the ability to upload photos. The company expects significant increases in demand during large events and must ensure that the website can handle the upload traffic from users.
Which solution meets these requirements with the MOST scalability?
A.
Upload files from the user's browser to the application servers. Transfer the files to an Amazon S3 bucket.
B.
Provision an AWS Storage Gateway file gateway. Upload files directly from the user's browser to the file gateway.
C.
Generate Amazon S3 presigned URLs in the application. Upload files directly from the user's browser into an S3 bucket.
D.
Provision an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file system. Upload files directly from the user's browser to the file system.

Answer: C

Explanation:
This approach allows users to upload files directly to S3 without passing through the application servers, reducing the load on the application and improving scalability. It leverages the client-side capabilities to handle the file uploads and offloads the processing to S3.

Question 454
A company has a web application for travel ticketing. The application is based on a database that runs in a single data center in North America. The company wants to expand the application to serve a global user base. The company needs to deploy the application to multiple AWS Regions. Average latency must be less than 1 second on updates to the reservation database.
The company wants to have separate deployments of its web platform across multiple Regions. However, the company must maintain a single primary reservation database that is globally consistent.
Which solution should a solutions architect recommend to meet these requirements?
A.
Convert the application to use Amazon DynamoDB. Use a global table for the center reservation table. Use the correct Regional endpoint in each Regional deployment.
B.
Migrate the database to an Amazon Aurora MySQL database. Deploy Aurora Read Replicas in each Region. Use the correct Regional endpoint in each Regional deployment for access to the database.
C.
Migrate the database to an Amazon RDS for MySQL database. Deploy MySQL read replicas in each Region. Use the correct Regional endpoint in each Regional deployment for access to the database.
D.
Migrate the application to an Amazon Aurora Serverless database. Deploy instances of the database to each Region. Use the correct Regional endpoint in each Regional deployment to access the database. Use AWS Lambda functions to process event streams in each Region to synchronize the databases.

Answer: A?B?

Explanation:
A
Using DynamoDB's global tables feature, you can achieve a globally consistent reservation database with low latency on updates, making it suitable for serving a global user base. The automatic replication provided by DynamoDB eliminates the need for manual synchronization between Regions.

B
Aurora Global DB provides native multi-master replication and automatic failover for high availability across regions.
Read replicas in each region ensure low read latency by promoting a local replica to handle reads.
A single Aurora primary region handles all writes to maintain data consistency.
Data replication and sync is managed automatically by Aurora Global DB.
Regional endpoints minimize cross-region latency.
Automatic failover promotes a replica to be the new primary if the current primary region goes down.


Question 455
A company has migrated multiple Microsoft Windows Server workloads to Amazon EC2 instances that run in the us-west-1 Region. The company manually backs up the workloads to create an image as needed.
In the event of a natural disaster in the us-west-1 Region, the company wants to recover workloads quickly in the us-west-2 Region. The company wants no more than 24 hours of data loss on the EC2 instances. The company also wants to automate any backups of the EC2 instances.
Which solutions will meet these requirements with the LEAST administrative effort? (Choose two.)
A.
Create an Amazon EC2-backed Amazon Machine Image (AMI) lifecycle policy to create a backup based on tags. Schedule the backup to run twice daily. Copy the image on demand.
B.
Create an Amazon EC2-backed Amazon Machine Image (AMI) lifecycle policy to create a backup based on tags. Schedule the backup to run twice daily. Configure the copy to the us-west-2 Region.
C.
Create backup vaults in us-west-1 and in us-west-2 by using AWS Backup. Create a backup plan for the EC2 instances based on tag values. Create an AWS Lambda function to run as a scheduled job to copy the backup data to us-west-2.
D.
Create a backup vault by using AWS Backup. Use AWS Backup to create a backup plan for the EC2 instances based on tag values. Define the destination for the copy as us-west-2. Specify the backup schedule to run twice daily.
E.
Create a backup vault by using AWS Backup. Use AWS Backup to create a backup plan for the EC2 instances based on tag values. Specify the backup schedule to run twice daily. Copy on demand to us-west-2.

Answer: BD

Explanation:
Option B suggests using an EC2-backed Amazon Machine Image (AMI) lifecycle policy to automate the backup process. By configuring the policy to run twice daily and specifying the copy to the us-west-2 Region, the company can ensure regular backups are created and copied to the alternate region.
Option D proposes using AWS Backup, which provides a centralized backup management solution. By creating a backup vault and backup plan based on tag values, the company can automate the backup process for the EC2 instances. The backup schedule can be set to run twice daily, and the destination for the copy can be defined as the us-west-2 Region.

Question 456
A company operates a two-tier application for image processing. The application uses two Availability Zones, each with one public subnet and one private subnet. An Application Load Balancer (ALB) for the web tier uses the public subnets. Amazon EC2 instances for the application tier use the private subnets.
Users report that the application is running more slowly than expected. A security audit of the web server log files shows that the application is receiving millions of illegitimate requests from a small number of IP addresses. A solutions architect needs to resolve the immediate performance problem while the company investigates a more permanent solution.
What should the solutions architect recommend to meet this requirement?
A.
Modify the inbound security group for the web tier. Add a deny rule for the IP addresses that are consuming resources.
B.
Modify the network ACL for the web tier subnets. Add an inbound deny rule for the IP addresses that are consuming resources.
C.
Modify the inbound security group for the application tier. Add a deny rule for the IP addresses that are consuming resources.
D.
Modify the network ACL for the application tier subnets. Add an inbound deny rule for the IP addresses that are consuming resources.

Answer: B

Explanation:
In this scenario, the security audit reveals that the application is receiving millions of illegitimate requests from a small number of IP addresses. To address this issue, it is recommended to modify the network ACL (Access Control List) for the web tier subnets.
By adding an inbound deny rule specifically targeting the IP addresses that are consuming resources, the network ACL can block the illegitimate traffic at the subnet level before it reaches the web servers. This will help alleviate the excessive load on the web tier and improve the application's performance.

Question 457
A company is developing an application that provides order shipping statistics for retrieval by a REST API. The company wants to extract the shipping statistics, organize the data into an easy-to-read HTML format, and send the report to several email addresses at the same time every morning.
Which combination of steps should a solutions architect take to meet these requirements? (Choose two.)
A.
Configure the application to send the data to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose.
B.
Use Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES) to format the data and to send the report by email.
C.
Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) scheduled event that invokes an AWS Glue job to query the application's API for the data.
D.
Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) scheduled event that invokes an AWS Lambda function to query the application's API for the data.
E.
Store the application data in Amazon S3. Create an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic as an S3 event destination to send the report by email.

Answer: BD

Explanation:
B&D are the only 2 correct options. If you are choosing option E then you missed the daily morning schedule requirement mentioned in the question which cant be achieved with S3 events for SNS. Event Bridge can used to configure scheduled events (every morning in this case). Option B fulfills the email in HTML format requirement (by SES) and D fulfills every morning schedule event requirement (by EventBridge)

Question 458
A global marketing company has applications that run in the ap-southeast-2 Region and the eu-west-1 Region. Applications that run in a VPC in eu-west-1 need to communicate securely with databases that run in a VPC in ap-southeast-2.
Which network design will meet these requirements?
A.
Create a VPC peering connection between the eu-west-1 VPC and the ap-southeast-2 VPC. Create an inbound rule in the eu-west-1 application security group that allows traffic from the database server IP addresses in the ap-southeast-2 security group.
B.
Configure a VPC peering connection between the ap-southeast-2 VPC and the eu-west-1 VPC. Update the subnet route tables. Create an inbound rule in the ap-southeast-2 database security group that references the security group ID of the application servers in eu-west-1.
C.
Configure a VPC peering connection between the ap-southeast-2 VPC and the eu-west-1 VPUpdate the subnet route tables. Create an inbound rule in the ap-southeast-2 database security group that allows traffic from the eu-west-1 application server IP addresses.
D.
Create a transit gateway with a peering attachment between the eu-west-1 VPC and the ap-southeast-2 VPC. After the transit gateways are properly peered and routing is configured, create an inbound rule in the database security group that references the security group ID of the application servers in eu-west-1.

Answer: B?C?

Explanation:
B
B) Configure VPC peering between ap-southeast-2 and eu-west-1 VPCs. Update routes. Allow traffic in ap-southeast-2 database SG from eu-west-1 application server SG.
This option establishes the correct network connectivity for the applications in eu-west-1 to reach the databases in ap-southeast-2:
VPC peering connects the two VPCs across regions - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/peering/what-is-vpc-peering.html#:~:text=You%20can%20create%20a%20VPC,%2DRegion%20VPC%20peering%20connection).
Updating route tables enables routing between the VPCs
Security group rule allowing traffic from eu-west-1 application server SG to ap-southeast-2 database SG secures connectivity

C
VPC Peering Connection: This allows communication between instances in different VPCs as if they are on the same network. It's a straightforward approach to connect the two VPCs.
Subnet Route Tables: After establishing the VPC peering connection, the subnet route tables need to be updated in both VPCs to route traffic to the other VPC's CIDR blocks through the peering connection.
Inbound Rule in Database Security Group: By creating an inbound rule in the ap-southeast-2 database security group that allows traffic from the eu-west-1 application server IP addresses, you ensure that only the specified application servers from the eu-west-1 VPC can access the database servers in the ap-southeast-2 VPC.

Question 459
A company is developing software that uses a PostgreSQL database schema. The company needs to configure multiple development environments and databases for the company's developers. On average, each development environment is used for half of the 8-hour workday.
Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?
A.
Configure each development environment with its own Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL database
B.
Configure each development environment with its own Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL Single-AZ DB instances
C.
Configure each development environment with its own Amazon Aurora On-Demand PostgreSQL-Compatible database
D.
Configure each development environment with its own Amazon S3 bucket by using Amazon S3 Object Select

Answer: B?C?

Explanation:
B
RDS Single-AZ instances only run the DB instance when in use, minimizing costs for dev environments not used full-time
RDS charges by the hour for DB instance hours used, versus Aurora clusters that have hourly uptime charges
PostgreSQL is natively supported by RDS so no compatibility issues
S3 Object Select (Option D) does not provide full database functionality
Aurora (Options A and C) has higher minimum costs than RDS even when not fully utilized

C
Option C suggests using Amazon Aurora On-Demand PostgreSQL-Compatible databases for each development environment. This option provides the benefits of Amazon Aurora, which is a high-performance and scalable database engine, while allowing you to pay for usage on an on-demand basis. Amazon Aurora On-Demand instances are typically more cost-effective for individual development environments compared to the provisioned capacity options.

Option B suggests using Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL Single-AZ DB instances for each development environment. While Amazon RDS is a reliable and cost-effective option, it may have slightly higher costs compared to Amazon Aurora On-Demand instances.

Question 460
A company uses AWS Organizations with resources tagged by account. The company also uses AWS Backup to back up its AWS infrastructure resources. The company needs to back up all AWS resources.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?
A.
Use AWS Config to identify all untagged resources. Tag the identified resources programmatically. Use tags in the backup plan.
B.
Use AWS Config to identify all resources that are not running. Add those resources to the backup vault.
C.
Require all AWS account owners to review their resources to identify the resources that need to be backed up.
D.
Use Amazon Inspector to identify all noncompliant resources.

Answer: A

Explanation:
This solution allows you to leverage AWS Config to identify any untagged resources within your AWS Organizations accounts. Once identified, you can programmatically apply the necessary tags to indicate the backup requirements for each resource. By using tags in the backup plan configuration, you can ensure that only the tagged resources are included in the backup process, reducing operational overhead and ensuring all necessary resources are backed up.

Question 461
A social media company wants to allow its users to upload images in an application that is hosted in the AWS Cloud. The company needs a solution that automatically resizes the images so that the images can be displayed on multiple device types. The application experiences unpredictable traffic patterns throughout the day. The company is seeking a highly available solution that maximizes scalability.
What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements?
A.
Create a static website hosted in Amazon S3 that invokes AWS Lambda functions to resize the images and store the images in an Amazon S3 bucket.
B.
Create a static website hosted in Amazon CloudFront that invokes AWS Step Functions to resize the images and store the images in an Amazon RDS database.
C.
Create a dynamic website hosted on a web server that runs on an Amazon EC2 instance. Configure a process that runs on the EC2 instance to resize the images and store the images in an Amazon S3 bucket.
D.
Create a dynamic website hosted on an automatically scaling Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) cluster that creates a resize job in Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS). Set up an image-resizing program that runs on an Amazon EC2 instance to process the resize jobs.

Answer: A

Explanation:
By using Amazon S3 and AWS Lambda together, you can create a serverless architecture that provides highly scalable and available image resizing capabilities. Here's how the solution would work:
Set up an Amazon S3 bucket to store the original images uploaded by users.
Configure an event trigger on the S3 bucket to invoke an AWS Lambda function whenever a new image is uploaded.
The Lambda function can be designed to retrieve the uploaded image, perform the necessary resizing operations based on device requirements, and store the resized images back in the S3 bucket or a different bucket designated for resized images.
Configure the Amazon S3 bucket to make the resized images publicly accessible for serving to users.

Question 462
A company is running a microservices application on Amazon EC2 instances. The company wants to migrate the application to an Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) cluster for scalability. The company must configure the Amazon EKS control plane with endpoint private access set to true and endpoint public access set to false to maintain security compliance. The company must also put the data plane in private subnets. However, the company has received error notifications because the node cannot join the cluster.
Which solution will allow the node to join the cluster?
A.
Grant the required permission in AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to the AmazonEKSNodeRole IAM role.
B.
Create interface VPC endpoints to allow nodes to access the control plane.
C.
Recreate nodes in the public subnet. Restrict security groups for EC2 nodes.
D.
Allow outbound traffic in the security group of the nodes.

Answer: A?B?

Explanation:
A
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/cluster-endpoint.html
"When you enable endpoint private access for your cluster, Amazon EKS creates a Route 53 private hosted zone on your behalf and associates it with your cluster's VPC. This private hosted zone is managed by Amazon EKS, and it doesn't appear in your account's Route 53 resources. "

B
By creating interface VPC endpoints, you can enable the necessary communication between the Amazon EKS control plane and the nodes in private subnets. This solution ensures that the control plane maintains endpoint private access (set to true) and endpoint public access (set to false) for security compliance.

Question 463
A company is migrating an on-premises application to AWS. The company wants to use Amazon Redshift as a solution.
Which use cases are suitable for Amazon Redshift in this scenario? (Choose three.)
A.
Supporting data APIs to access data with traditional, containerized, and event-driven applications
B.
Supporting client-side and server-side encryption
C.
Building analytics workloads during specified hours and when the application is not active
D.
Caching data to reduce the pressure on the backend database
E.
Scaling globally to support petabytes of data and tens of millions of requests per minute
F.
Creating a secondary replica of the cluster by using the AWS Management Console

Answer: BCE?ACE?

Explanation:
ACE
Quote: "The Data API enables you to seamlessly access data from Redshift Serverless with all types of traditional, cloud-native, and containerized serverless web service-based applications and event-driven applications." at https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/use-the-amazon-redshift-data-api-to-interact-with-amazon-redshift-serverless/ (28/4/2023). Choose A. C and E are next chosen correct answers.

B is too generic of a choice
D caching is not the main purpose of Redshift
F replication is not main use of Redshift

BCE
Amazon Redshift is a data warehouse solution, so it is suitable for:
-Supporting encryption (client-side and server-side)
-Handling analytics workloads, especially during off-peak hours when the application is less active
-Scaling to large amounts of data and high query volumes for analytics purposes
The following options are incorrect because:
A) Data APIs are not typically used with Redshift. It is more for running SQL queries and analytics.
D) Redshift is not typically used for caching data. It is for analytics and data warehouse purposes.
F) Redshift clusters do not create replicas in the management console. They are standalone clusters. you could create DR cluster from snapshot and restore to another region (automated or manual) but I do not think this what is meant in this option.

Question 464
A company provides an API interface to customers so the customers can retrieve their financial information. Еhe company expects a larger number of requests during peak usage times of the year.
The company requires the API to respond consistently with low latency to ensure customer satisfaction. The company needs to provide a compute host for the API.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?
A.
Use an Application Load Balancer and Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS).
B.
Use Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda functions with provisioned concurrency.
C.
Use an Application Load Balancer and an Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) cluster.
D.
Use Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda functions with reserved concurrency.

Answer: B

Explanation:
In the context of the given scenario, where the company wants low latency and consistent performance for their API during peak usage times, it would be more suitable to use provisioned concurrency. By allocating a specific number of concurrent executions, the company can ensure that there are enough function instances available to handle the expected load and minimize the impact of cold starts. This will result in lower latency and improved performance for the API.

Question 465
A company wants to send all AWS Systems Manager Session Manager logs to an Amazon S3 bucket for archival purposes.
Which solution will meet this requirement with the MOST operational efficiency?
A.
Enable S3 logging in the Systems Manager console. Choose an S3 bucket to send the session data to.
B.
Install the Amazon CloudWatch agent. Push all logs to a CloudWatch log group. Export the logs to an S3 bucket from the group for archival purposes.
C.
Create a Systems Manager document to upload all server logs to a central S3 bucket. Use Amazon EventBridge to run the Systems Manager document against all servers that are in the account daily.
D.
Install an Amazon CloudWatch agent. Push all logs to a CloudWatch log group. Create a CloudWatch logs subscription that pushes any incoming log events to an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream. Set Amazon S3 as the destination.

Answer: A

Explanation:
Most efficient is A because it is a direct option in SM logging. 
B can work but is more operational overhead as you end up using CloudWatch (not sure how but making assumption based on language of option)
C is definitely too much work
D Way too many moving parts

Question 466
An application uses an Amazon RDS MySQL DB instance. The RDS database is becoming low on disk space. A solutions architect wants to increase the disk space without downtime.
Which solution meets these requirements with the LEAST amount of effort?
A.
Enable storage autoscaling in RDS
B.
Increase the RDS database instance size
C.
Change the RDS database instance storage type to Provisioned IOPS
D.
Back up the RDS database, increase the storage capacity, restore the database, and stop the previous instance

Answer: A

Explanation:
Enabling storage autoscaling allows RDS to automatically adjust the storage capacity based on the application's needs. When the storage usage exceeds a predefined threshold, RDS will automatically increase the allocated storage without requiring manual intervention or causing downtime. This ensures that the RDS database has sufficient disk space to handle the increasing storage requirements.

Question 467
A consulting company provides professional services to customers worldwide. The company provides solutions and tools for customers to expedite gathering and analyzing data on AWS. The company needs to centrally manage and deploy a common set of solutions and tools for customers to use for self-service purposes.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Create AWS CloudFormation templates for the customers.
B.
Create AWS Service Catalog products for the customers.
C.
Create AWS Systems Manager templates for the customers.
D.
Create AWS Config items for the customers.

Answer: B

Explanation:
Centralized management - Products can be maintained in a single catalog for easy discovery and governance.
Self-service access - Customers can deploy the solutions on their own without manual intervention.
Standardization - Products provide pre-defined templates for consistent deployment.
Access control - Granular permissions can be applied to restrict product visibility and access.
Reporting - Service Catalog provides detailed analytics on product usage and deployments.

Question 468
A company wants to migrate its on-premises application to AWS. The application produces output files that vary in size from tens of gigabytes to hundreds of terabytes. The application data must be stored in a standard file system structure. The company wants a solution that scales automatically. is highly available, and requires minimum operational overhead.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Migrate the application to run as containers on Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS). Use Amazon S3 for storage.
B.
Migrate the application to run as containers on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS). Use Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) for storage.
C.
Migrate the application to Amazon EC2 instances in a Multi-AZ Auto Scaling group. Use Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) for storage.
D.
Migrate the application to Amazon EC2 instances in a Multi-AZ Auto Scaling group. Use Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) for storage.

Answer: C

Explanation:
EFS provides a scalable and fully managed file system that can be easily mounted to multiple EC2. It allows you to store and access files using the standard file system structure, which aligns with the company's requirement for a standard file system. EFS automatically scales with the size of your data.
A suggests using ECS for container orchestration and S3 for storage. ECS doesn't offer a native file system storage solution. S3 is an object storage service and may not be the most suitable option for a standard file system structure.
B suggests using EKS for container orchestration and EBS for storage. Similar to A, EBS is block storage and not optimized for file system access. While EKS can manage containers, it doesn't specifically address the file storage requirements.
D suggests using EC2 with EBS for storage. While EBS can provide block storage for EC2, it doesn't inherently offer a scalable file system solution like EFS. You would need to manage and provision EBS volumes manually, which may introduce operational overhead.

Question 469
A company is designing a new web application that will run on Amazon EC2 Instances. The application will use Amazon DynamoDB for backend data storage. The application traffic will be unpredictable. The company expects that the application read and write throughput to the database will be moderate to high. The company needs to scale in response to application traffic.
Which DynamoDB table configuration will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?
A.
Configure DynamoDB with provisioned read and write by using the DynamoDB Standard table class. Set DynamoDB auto scaling to a maximum defined capacity.
B.
Configure DynamoDB in on-demand mode by using the DynamoDB Standard table class.
C.
Configure DynamoDB with provisioned read and write by using the DynamoDB Standard Infrequent Access (DynamoDB Standard-IA) table class. Set DynamoDB auto scaling to a maximum defined capacity.
D.
Configure DynamoDB in on-demand mode by using the DynamoDB Standard Infrequent Access (DynamoDB Standard-IA) table class.

Answer: B

Explanation:
With On-Demand mode, you only pay for what you use instead of over-provisioning capacity. This avoids idle capacity costs.
DynamoDB Standard provides the fastest performance needed for moderate-high traffic apps vs Standard-IA which is for less frequent access.
Auto scaling with provisioned capacity can also work but requires more administrative effort to tune the scaling thresholds.

Question 470
A retail company has several businesses. The IT team for each business manages its own AWS account. Each team account is part of an organization in AWS Organizations. Each team monitors its product inventory levels in an Amazon DynamoDB table in the team's own AWS account.
The company is deploying a central inventory reporting application into a shared AWS account. The application must be able to read items from all the teams' DynamoDB tables.
Which authentication option will meet these requirements MOST securely?
A.
Integrate DynamoDB with AWS Secrets Manager in the inventory application account. Configure the application to use the correct secret from Secrets Manager to authenticate and read the DynamoDB table. Schedule secret rotation for every 30 days.
B.
In every business account, create an IAM user that has programmatic access. Configure the application to use the correct IAM user access key ID and secret access key to authenticate and read the DynamoDB table. Manually rotate IAM access keys every 30 days.
C.
In every business account, create an IAM role named BU_ROLE with a policy that gives the role access to the DynamoDB table and a trust policy to trust a specific role in the inventory application account. In the inventory account, create a role named APP_ROLE that allows access to the STS AssumeRole API operation. Configure the application to use APP_ROLE and assume the crossaccount role BU_ROLE to read the DynamoDB table.
D.
Integrate DynamoDB with AWS Certificate Manager (ACM). Generate identity certificates to authenticate DynamoDB. Configure the application to use the correct certificate to authenticate and read the DynamoDB table.

Answer: C

Explanation:
IAM Roles: IAM roles provide a secure way to grant permissions to entities within AWS. By creating an IAM role in each business account named BU_ROLE with the necessary permissions to access the DynamoDB table, the access can be controlled at the IAM role level.
Cross-Account Access: By configuring a trust policy in the BU_ROLE that trusts a specific role in the inventory application account (APP_ROLE), you establish a trusted relationship between the two accounts.
Least Privilege: By creating a specific IAM role (BU_ROLE) in each business account and granting it access only to the required DynamoDB table, you can ensure that each team's table is accessed with the least privilege principle.
Security Token Service (STS): The use of STS AssumeRole API operation in the inventory application account allows the application to assume the cross-account role (BU_ROLE) in each business account.

Question 471
A company runs container applications by using Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS). The company's workload is not consistent throughout the day. The company wants Amazon EKS to scale in and out according to the workload.
Which combination of steps will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead? (Choose two.)
A.
Use an AWS Lambda function to resize the EKS cluster.
B.
Use the Kubernetes Metrics Server to activate horizontal pod autoscaling.
C.
Use the Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler to manage the number of nodes in the cluster.
D.
Use Amazon API Gateway and connect it to Amazon EKS.
E.
Use AWS App Mesh to observe network activity.

Answer: BC

Explanation:
Using the Kubernetes Metrics Server (B) enables horizontal pod autoscaling to dynamically scale pods based on CPU/memory usage. This allows scaling at the application tier level.
The Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler (C) automatically adjusts the number of nodes in the EKS cluster in response to pod resource requirements and events. This allows scaling at the infrastructure level.

Question 472
A company runs a microservice-based serverless web application. The application must be able to retrieve data from multiple Amazon DynamoDB tables A solutions architect needs to give the application the ability to retrieve the data with no impact on the baseline performance of the application.
Which solution will meet these requirements in the MOST operationally efficient way?
A.
AWS AppSync pipeline resolvers
B.
Amazon CloudFront with Lambda@Edge functions
C.
Edge-optimized Amazon API Gateway with AWS Lambda functions
D.
Amazon Athena Federated Query with a DynamoDB connector

Answer: A?D?

Explanation:
A
A. AppSync reduces operational effort, you only need to know GraphQL, AppSync provides caching ability to reduce loads on source
B. Also provide caches through CloudFront, but require writing more 'low-level' codes on Lambda
D. Requires a Lambda to create connection to DynamoDB source, also no caching

D
Not A - Pipe Resolvers require coding, would not consider that 'operationally efficient'
Not B - CloudFront caches web content at the edge, not DynamoDB query results for apps
Not C - Neither API Gateway or Lambda have anything to do with DynamoDB performance
D - Can do exactly that

Question 473
A company wants to analyze and troubleshoot Access Denied errors and Unauthorized errors that are related to IAM permissions. The company has AWS CloudTrail turned on.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST effort?
A.
Use AWS Glue and write custom scripts to query CloudTrail logs for the errors.
B.
Use AWS Batch and write custom scripts to query CloudTrail logs for the errors.
C.
Search CloudTrail logs with Amazon Athena queries to identify the errors.
D.
Search CloudTrail logs with Amazon QuickSight. Create a dashboard to identify the errors.

Answer: C

Explanation:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/cloudtrail-logs.html
When troubleshooting you will want to query specific things in the log and Athena provides query language for that.
Quick Sight is data analytics and visualisation tool. You can use it to aggregate data and maybe make a dashboard for number of errors by type etc but that doesn't help you troubleshoot anything.

Question 474
A company wants to add its existing AWS usage cost to its operation cost dashboard. A solutions architect needs to recommend a solution that will give the company access to its usage cost programmatically. The company must be able to access cost data for the current year and forecast costs for the next 12 months.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?
A.
Access usage cost-related data by using the AWS Cost Explorer API with pagination.
B.
Access usage cost-related data by using downloadable AWS Cost Explorer report .csv files.
C.
Configure AWS Budgets actions to send usage cost data to the company through FTP.
D.
Create AWS Budgets reports for usage cost data. Send the data to the company through SMTP.

Answer: A

Explanation:
From AWS Documentation*: 
"You can view your costs and usage using the Cost Explorer user interface free of charge. You can also access your data programmatically using the Cost Explorer API. Each paginated API request incurs a charge of $0.01. You can't disable Cost Explorer after you enable it."

Question 475
A solutions architect is reviewing the resilience of an application. The solutions architect notices that a database administrator recently failed over the application's Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL database writer instance as part of a scaling exercise. The failover resulted in 3 minutes of downtime for the application.
Which solution will reduce the downtime for scaling exercises with the LEAST operational overhead?
A.
Create more Aurora PostgreSQL read replicas in the cluster to handle the load during failover.
B.
Set up a secondary Aurora PostgreSQL cluster in the same AWS Region. During failover, update the application to use the secondary cluster's writer endpoint.
C.
Create an Amazon ElastiCache for Memcached cluster to handle the load during failover.
D.
Set up an Amazon RDS proxy for the database. Update the application to use the proxy endpoint.

Answer: D

Explanation:
It is talking about the write database. Not reader.
Amazon RDS proxy allows you to automatically route write request to the healthy writer, minimizing downtime.

One of the benefits of Amazon RDS Proxy is that it can improve application recovery time after database failovers. While RDS Proxy supports both MySQL as well as PostgreSQL engines, in this post, we will use a MySQL test workload to demonstrate how RDS Proxy reduces client recovery time after failover by up to 79% for Amazon Aurora MySQL and by up to 32% for Amazon RDS for MySQL.

Question 476
A company has a regional subscription-based streaming service that runs in a single AWS Region. The architecture consists of web servers and application servers on Amazon EC2 instances. The EC2 instances are in Auto Scaling groups behind Elastic Load Balancers. The architecture includes an Amazon Aurora global database cluster that extends across multiple Availability Zones.
The company wants to expand globally and to ensure that its application has minimal downtime.
Which solution will provide the MOST fault tolerance?
A.
Extend the Auto Scaling groups for the web tier and the application tier to deploy instances in Availability Zones in a second Region. Use an Aurora global database to deploy the database in the primary Region and the second Region. Use Amazon Route 53 health checks with a failover routing policy to the second Region.
B.
Deploy the web tier and the application tier to a second Region. Add an Aurora PostgreSQL cross-Region Aurora Replica in the second Region. Use Amazon Route 53 health checks with a failover routing policy to the second Region. Promote the secondary to primary as needed.
C.
Deploy the web tier and the application tier to a second Region. Create an Aurora PostgreSQL database in the second Region. Use AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) to replicate the primary database to the second Region. Use Amazon Route 53 health checks with a failover routing policy to the second Region.
D.
Deploy the web tier and the application tier to a second Region. Use an Amazon Aurora global database to deploy the database in the primary Region and the second Region. Use Amazon Route 53 health checks with a failover routing policy to the second Region. Promote the secondary to primary as needed.

Answer: D

Explanation:
Using an Aurora global database that spans both the primary and secondary regions provides automatic replication and failover capabilities for the database tier.
Deploying the web and application tiers to a second region provides fault tolerance for those components.
Using Route53 health checks and failover routing will route traffic to the secondary region if the primary region becomes unavailable.
This provides fault tolerance across all tiers of the architecture while minimizing downtime. Promoting the secondary database to primary ensures the second region can continue operating if needed.
A is close, but doesn't provide an automatic database failover capability.
B and C provide database replication, but not automatic failover.
So D is the most comprehensive and fault tolerant architecture.

Auto Scaling groups can span Availability Zones, but not AWS regions.

Question 477
A data analytics company wants to migrate its batch processing system to AWS. The company receives thousands of small data files periodically during the day through FTP. An on-premises batch job processes the data files overnight. However, the batch job takes hours to finish running.
The company wants the AWS solution to process incoming data files as soon as possible with minimal changes to the FTP clients that send the files. The solution must delete the incoming data files after the files have been processed successfully. Processing for each file needs to take 3-8 minutes.
Which solution will meet these requirements in the MOST operationally efficient way?
A.
Use an Amazon EC2 instance that runs an FTP server to store incoming files as objects in Amazon S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval. Configure a job queue in AWS Batch. Use Amazon EventBridge rules to invoke the job to process the objects nightly from S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval. Delete the objects after the job has processed the objects.
B.
Use an Amazon EC2 instance that runs an FTP server to store incoming files on an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume. Configure a job queue in AWS Batch. Use Amazon EventBridge rules to invoke the job to process the files nightly from the EBS volume. Delete the files after the job has processed the files.
C.
Use AWS Transfer Family to create an FTP server to store incoming files on an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume. Configure a job queue in AWS Batch. Use an Amazon S3 event notification when each file arrives to invoke the job in AWS Batch. Delete the files after the job has processed the files.
D.
Use AWS Transfer Family to create an FTP server to store incoming files in Amazon S3 Standard. Create an AWS Lambda function to process the files and to delete the files after they are processed. Use an S3 event notification to invoke the Lambda function when the files arrive.

Answer: D

Explanation:
Use AWS Transfer Family for the FTP server to receive files directly into S3. This avoids managing FTP servers.
Process each file as soon as it arrives using Lambda triggered by S3 events. Lambda provides fast processing time per file.
Lambda can also delete files after processing succeeds.
Options A, B, C involve more operational overhead of managing FTP servers and batch jobs. Processing latency would be higher waiting for batch windows.
Storing files in Glacier (Option A) adds latency for retrieving files.

Question 478
A company is migrating its workloads to AWS. The company has transactional and sensitive data in its databases. The company wants to use AWS Cloud solutions to increase security and reduce operational overhead for the databases.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Migrate the databases to Amazon EC2. Use an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) AWS managed key for encryption.
B.
Migrate the databases to Amazon RDS Configure encryption at rest.
C.
Migrate the data to Amazon S3 Use Amazon Macie for data security and protection
D.
Migrate the database to Amazon RDS. Use Amazon CloudWatch Logs for data security and protection.

Answer: B

Explanation:
Why not C - Option C suggests migrating the data to Amazon S3 and using Amazon Macie for data security and protection. While Amazon Macie provides advanced security features for data in S3, it may not be directly applicable or optimized for databases, especially for transactional and sensitive data. Amazon RDS provides a more suitable environment for managing databases.

Question 479
A company needs to store its accounting records in Amazon S3. The records must be immediately accessible for 1 year and then must be archived for an additional 9 years. No one at the company, including administrative users and root users, can be able to delete the records during the entire 10-year period. The records must be stored with maximum resiliency.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Store the records in S3 Glacier for the entire 10-year period. Use an access control policy to deny deletion of the records for a period of 10 years.
B.
Store the records by using S3 Intelligent-Tiering. Use an IAM policy to deny deletion of the records. After 10 years, change the IAM policy to allow deletion.
C.
Use an S3 Lifecycle policy to transition the records from S3 Standard to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 1 year. Use S3 Object Lock in compliance mode for a period of 10 years.
D.
Use an S3 Lifecycle policy to transition the records from S3 Standard to S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA) after 1 year. Use S3 Object Lock in governance mode for a period of 10 years.

Answer: C

Explanation:
The S3 Lifecycle policy transitions the data to Glacier Deep Archive after 1 year for long-term archival.
S3 Object Lock in compliance mode prevents any user from deleting or overwriting objects for the specified retention period.
Glacier Deep Archive provides very high durability and the lowest storage cost for long-term archival.
Compliance mode ensures no one can override or change the retention settings even if policies change.
This meets all the requirements - immediate access for 1 year, archived for 9 years, unable to delete for 10 years, maximum resiliency

Question 480
A company has an online gaming application that has TCP and UDP multiplayer gaming capabilities. The company uses Amazon Route 53 to point the application traffic to multiple Network Load Balancers (NLBs) in different AWS Regions. The company needs to improve application performance and decrease latency for the online game in preparation for user growth.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Add an Amazon CloudFront distribution in front of the NLBs. Increase the Cache-Control max-age parameter.
B.
Replace the NLBs with Application Load Balancers (ALBs). Configure Route 53 to use latency-based routing.
C.
Add AWS Global Accelerator in front of the NLBs. Configure a Global Accelerator endpoint to use the correct listener ports.
D.
Add an Amazon API Gateway endpoint behind the NLBs. Enable API caching. Override method caching for the different stages.

Answer: C

Explanation:
The application uses TCP and UDP for multiplayer gaming, so Network Load Balancers (NLBs) are appropriate.
AWS Global Accelerator can be added in front of the NLBs to improve performance and reduce latency by intelligently routing traffic across AWS Regions and Availability Zones.
Global Accelerator provides static anycast IP addresses that act as a fixed entry point to application endpoints in the optimal AWS location. This improves availability and reduces latency.
The Global Accelerator endpoint can be configured with the correct NLB listener ports for TCP and UDP.

Question 481
A company needs to integrate with a third-party data feed. The data feed sends a webhook to notify an external service when new data is ready for consumption. A developer wrote an AWS Lambda function to retrieve data when the company receives a webhook callback. The developer must make the Lambda function available for the third party to call.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the MOST operational efficiency?
A.
Create a function URL for the Lambda function. Provide the Lambda function URL to the third party for the webhook.
B.
Deploy an Application Load Balancer (ALB) in front of the Lambda function. Provide the ALB URL to the third party for the webhook.
C.
Create an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic. Attach the topic to the Lambda function. Provide the public hostname of the SNS topic to the third party for the webhook.
D.
Create an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Attach the queue to the Lambda function. Provide the public hostname of the SQS queue to the third party for the webhook.

Answer: A

Explanation:
A Lambda function needs to be invoked by a third party via a webhook.
Using a function URL provides a direct invoke endpoint for the Lambda function. This is simple and efficient.
Options B, C, and D insert unnecessary components like ALB, SNS, SQS between the webhook and the Lambda function. These add complexity without benefit.
A function URL can be generated and provided to the third party quickly without additional infrastructure.

Question 482
A company has a workload in an AWS Region. Customers connect to and access the workload by using an Amazon API Gateway REST API. The company uses Amazon Route 53 as its DNS provider. The company wants to provide individual and secure URLs for all customers.
Which combination of steps will meet these requirements with the MOST operational efficiency? (Choose three.)
A.
Register the required domain in a registrar. Create a wildcard custom domain name in a Route 53 hosted zone and record in the zone that points to the API Gateway endpoint.
B.
Request a wildcard certificate that matches the domains in AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) in a different Region.
C.
Create hosted zones for each customer as required in Route 53. Create zone records that point to the API Gateway endpoint.
D.
Request a wildcard certificate that matches the custom domain name in AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) in the same Region.
E.
Create multiple API endpoints for each customer in API Gateway.
F.
Create a custom domain name in API Gateway for the REST API. Import the certificate from AWS Certificate Manager (ACM).

Answer: ADF

Explanation:
Using a wildcard domain and certificate avoids managing individual domains/certs per customer. This is more efficient.
The domain, hosted zone, and certificate should all be in the same region as the API Gateway REST API for simplicity.
Creating multiple API endpoints per customer (Option E) adds complexity and is not required.
Option B and C add unnecessary complexity by separating domains, certificates, and hosted zones.

Question 483
A company stores data in Amazon S3. According to regulations, the data must not contain personally identifiable information (PII). The company recently discovered that S3 buckets have some objects that contain PII. The company needs to automatically detect PII in S3 buckets and to notify the company’s security team.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Use Amazon Macie. Create an Amazon EventBridge rule to filter the SensitiveData event type from Macie findings and to send an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) notification to the security team.
B.
Use Amazon GuardDuty. Create an Amazon EventBridge rule to filter the CRITICAL event type from GuardDuty findings and to send an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) notification to the security team.
C.
Use Amazon Macie. Create an Amazon EventBridge rule to filter the SensitiveData:S3Object/Personal event type from Macie findings and to send an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) notification to the security team.
D.
Use Amazon GuardDuty. Create an Amazon EventBridge rule to filter the CRITICAL event type from GuardDuty findings and to send an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) notification to the security team.

Answer: A?C?

Explanation:
A
B and D are discarted as Macie is to identify PII. 
Now that we have between A and C.
SNS is more suitable for this option as a pub/sub service, we subscribe the security team and then they will receive the notifications.

C
There are different types of Sensitive Data. Here we are only referring to PII. Hence SensitiveData:S3Object/Personal. to use SNS, the security team must subscribe. SQS sends the information as designed

Question 484
A company wants to build a logging solution for its multiple AWS accounts. The company currently stores the logs from all accounts in a centralized account. The company has created an Amazon S3 bucket in the centralized account to store the VPC flow logs and AWS CloudTrail logs. All logs must be highly available for 30 days for frequent analysis, retained for an additional 60 days for backup purposes, and deleted 90 days after creation.
Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?
A.
Transition objects to the S3 Standard storage class 30 days after creation. Write an expiration action that directs Amazon S3 to delete objects after 90 days.
B.
Transition objects to the S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) storage class 30 days after creation. Move all objects to the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval storage class after 90 days. Write an expiration action that directs Amazon S3 to delete objects after 90 days.
C.
Transition objects to the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval storage class 30 days after creation. Write an expiration action that directs Amazon S3 to delete objects after 90 days.
D.
Transition objects to the S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA) storage class 30 days after creation. Move all objects to the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval storage class after 90 days. Write an expiration action that directs Amazon S3 to delete objects after 90 days.

Answer: A?B?C?

Explanation:
A
The Glacier min storage duration is 90 days. All the options using Glacier are wrong. 

B
The first 30 days, the logs need to be highly available for frequent analysis. The S3 Standard storage class is the most expensive storage class, but it also provides the highest availability.
After 30 days, the logs still need to be retained for backup purposes, but they do not need to be accessed frequently. The S3 Standard-IA storage class is a good option for this, as it is less expensive than the S3 Standard storage class.
After 90 days, the logs can be moved to the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval storage class. This is the most cost-effective storage class for long-term archiving.
The expiration action will ensure that the objects are deleted after 90 days, even if they are not accessed

C
Is the lowest cost. 
After 30 days is backup only, doesn't specify frequent access. 
Therefor we must transition the items after 30 days to Glacier Flexible Retrieval.
Also it says deletion after 90 days, so all answers specifying a transition after 90 days makes no sense.

Question 485
A company is building an Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) cluster for its workloads. All secrets that are stored in Amazon EKS must be encrypted in the Kubernetes etcd key-value store.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Create a new AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key. Use AWS Secrets Manager to manage, rotate, and store all secrets in Amazon EKS.
B.
Create a new AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key. Enable Amazon EKS KMS secrets encryption on the Amazon EKS cluster.
C.
Create the Amazon EKS cluster with default options. Use the Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver as an add-on.
D.
Create a new AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key with the alias/aws/ebs alias. Enable default Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume encryption for the account.

Answer: B

Explanation:
B is the correct solution to meet the requirement of encrypting secrets in the etcd store for an Amazon EKS cluster.
The key points:
Create a new KMS key to use for encryption.
Enable EKS secrets encryption using that KMS key on the EKS cluster. This will encrypt secrets in the Kubernetes etcd store.
Option A uses Secrets Manager which does not encrypt the etcd store.
Option C uses EBS CSI which is unrelated to etcd encryption.
Option D enables EBS encryption but does not address etcd encryption.

Question 486
A company wants to provide data scientists with near real-time read-only access to the company's production Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL database. The database is currently configured as a Single-AZ database. The data scientists use complex queries that will not affect the production database.

Explanation:
Option D is the most cost-effective solution that meets the requirements for this scenario.
The key considerations are:
Data scientists need read-only access to near real-time production data without affecting performance.
High availability is required.
Cost should be minimized.

Question 487
A company runs a three-tier web application in the AWS Cloud that operates across three Availability Zones. The application architecture has an Application Load Balancer, an Amazon EC2 web server that hosts user session states, and a MySQL database that runs on an EC2 instance. The company expects sudden increases in application traffic. The company wants to be able to scale to meet future application capacity demands and to ensure high availability across all three Availability Zones.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Migrate the MySQL database to Amazon RDS for MySQL with a Multi-AZ DB cluster deployment. Use Amazon ElastiCache for Redis with high availability to store session data and to cache reads. Migrate the web server to an Auto Scaling group that is in three Availability Zones.
B.

D.
Migrate the MySQL database to Amazon RDS for MySQL in a single Availability Zone. Use Amazon ElastiCache for Redis with high availability to store session data and to cache reads. Migrate the web server to an Auto Scaling group that is in three Availability Zones.

Answer: A

Explanation:
The key reasons why option A is preferable:
RDS Multi-AZ provides high availability for MySQL by synchronously replicating data across AZs. Automatic failover handles AZ outages.
ElastiCache for Redis is better suited for session data caching than Memcached. Redis offers more advanced data structures and flexibility.
Auto scaling across 3 AZs provides high availability for the web tier

Answer: A

Explanation:
This question asks us to guess Netflix subscription model in 2 mins! lol!
BCD are impractical for geo restrictions as you cannot restrict URL by region and you cannot encrypt by geo region (country etc)

Question 489
A company wants to use the AWS Cloud to improve its on-premises disaster recovery (DR) configuration. The company's core production business application uses Microsoft SQL Server Standard, which runs on a virtual machine (VM). The application has a recovery point objective (RPO) of 30 seconds or fewer and a recovery time objective (RTO) of 60 minutes. The DR solution needs to minimize costs wherever possible.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Configure a multi-site active/active setup between the on-premises server and AWS by using Microsoft SQL Server Enterprise with Always On availability groups.
B.
Configure a warm standby Amazon RDS for SQL Server database on AWS. Configure AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) to use change data capture (CDC).
C.
Use AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery configured to replicate disk changes to AWS as a pilot light.
D.
Use third-party backup software to capture backups every night. Store a secondary set of backups in Amazon S3.

Answer: B?C?

Explanation:
B
Pilot light (RPO in minutes, RTO in tens of minutes)
Warm standby (RPO in seconds, RTO in minutes)
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/reliability-pillar/rel_planning_for_recovery_disaster_recovery.html

C
If you are considering the pilot light or warm standby strategy for disaster recovery, AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery could provide an alternative approach with improved benefits. Elastic Disaster Recovery can offer an RPO and RTO target similar to warm standby, but maintain the low-cost approach of pilot light

Question 490
A company runs multiple Windows workloads on AWS. The company's employees use Windows file shares that are hosted on two Amazon EC2 instances. The file shares synchronize data between themselves and maintain duplicate copies. The company wants a highly available and durable storage solution that preserves how users currently access the files.
What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements?
A.
Migrate all the data to Amazon S3. Set up IAM authentication for users to access files.
B.
Set up an Amazon S3 File Gateway. Mount the S3 File Gateway on the existing EC2 instances.
C.
Extend the file share environment to Amazon FSx for Windows File Server with a Multi-AZ configuration. Migrate all the data to FSx for Windows File Server.
D.
Extend the file share environment to Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) with a Multi-AZ configuration. Migrate all the data to Amazon EFS.

Answer: C

Explanation:
Migrating all the data to FSx for Windows File Server allows you to preserve existing user access method and maintain compatibility with Windows file shares. Users can continue accessing files using the same method as before, without any disruptions.
A: S3 is a highly durable object storage service, it is not designed to directly host Windows file shares. Implementing IAM authentication for file access would require significant changes to existing user access method.
B: S3 File Gateway can provide access to Amazon S3 objects through standard file protocols, it may not be ideal solution for preserving existing user access method and maintaining Windows file shares.
D: Although Amazon EFS provides highly available and durable file storage, it may not directly support the existing Windows file shares and their access method.

Question 491
A company has an on-premises server that uses an Oracle database to process and store customer information. The company wants to use an AWS database service to achieve higher availability and to improve application performance. The company also wants to offload reporting from its primary database system.
Which solution will meet these requirements in the MOST operationally efficient way?
A.
Use AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) to create an Amazon RDS DB instance in multiple AWS Regions. Point the reporting functions toward a separate DB instance from the primary DB instance.
B.
Use Amazon RDS in a Single-AZ deployment to create an Oracle database. Create a read replica in the same zone as the primary DB instance. Direct the reporting functions to the read replica.
C.
Use Amazon RDS deployed in a Multi-AZ cluster deployment to create an Oracle database. Direct the reporting functions to use the reader instance in the cluster deployment.
D.
Use Amazon RDS deployed in a Multi-AZ instance deployment to create an Amazon Aurora database. Direct the reporting functions to the reader instances.

Answer: C?D?

Explanation:
C
Using RDS Multi-AZ provides high availability and failover capabilities for the primary Oracle database.
The reader instance in the Multi-AZ cluster can be used for offloading reporting workloads from the primary instance. This improves performance.
RDS Multi-AZ has automatic failover between AZs. DMS and Aurora migrations (A, D) would incur more effort and downtime.
Single-AZ with a read replica (B) does not provide the AZ failover capability that Multi-AZ does.

D
Not A - Creating multiple instances and keeping them in sync in DMS is surely not "operationally efficient"
Not B - "replica in the same zone" -> does not provide "higher availability"
Not C - "Multi-AZ cluster" does not support Oracle engine
Thus D. Question does not mention that the app would use Oracle-specific features; we're also not asked to minimize application changes. Ideal solution from AWS point of view is to move from Oracle to Aurora.

Question 492

Answer: ACE

Explanation:
A: App may be idle for long time so Lambda is perfect (charge per invocation)
C: Cognito user pool for user auth
E: Amplify is low code web dev tool
B: Wrong, too much cost when idle
D: Identity pool is session management/identification. Does not help with auth.
F: S3 + PHP doesn't work also no security

Question 493
A media company uses an Amazon CloudFront distribution to deliver content over the internet. The company wants only premium customers to have access to the media streams and file content. The company stores all content in an Amazon S3 bucket. The company also delivers content on demand to customers for a specific purpose, such as movie rentals or music downloads.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Generate and provide S3 signed cookies to premium customers.
B.
Generate and provide CloudFront signed URLs to premium customers.
C.
Use origin access control (OAC) to limit the access of non-premium customers.
D.
Generate and activate field-level encryption to block non-premium customers.

Answer: B

Explanation:
CloudFront Signed URL with Custom Policy are exactly for this.
A: Nope, cookies don't help as they don't restrict URL
C: Wrong. OAC for non-premium customers, how is that even possible without any details here?
D: Field encryption, while good idea, does not help restricting the content by customer

Question 494
A company runs Amazon EC2 instances in multiple AWS accounts that are individually bled. The company recently purchased a Savings Pian. Because of changes in the company’s business requirements, the company has decommissioned a large number of EC2 instances. The company wants to use its Savings Plan discounts on its other AWS accounts.
Which combination of steps will meet these requirements? (Choose two.)
A.
From the AWS Account Management Console of the management account, turn on discount sharing from the billing preferences section.
B.
From the AWS Account Management Console of the account that purchased the existing Savings Plan, turn on discount sharing from the billing preferences section. Include all accounts.
C.
From the AWS Organizations management account, use AWS Resource Access Manager (AWS RAM) to share the Savings Plan with other accounts.
D.
Create an organization in AWS Organizations in a new payer account. Invite the other AWS accounts to join the organization from the management account.
E.
Create an organization in AWS Organizations in the existing AWS account with the existing EC2 instances and Savings Plan. Invite the other AWS accounts to join the organization from the management account.

Answer: AD?AE?

Explanation:
AD
Organization should be created by a new account that is reserved for management. Thus D, followed by A (discount sharing must be enabled in the management account).

AE
- B is not accepted, because "include all accounts", remove B.
- D has "Create an organization in AWS Organization in a new payer acocunt", it is wrong, remove D.
- at C: AWS Resource Access Manager (AWS RAM) https://aws.amazon.com/ram/ it is for security, not for billing. Remove C.
Has A, E remain, and choosed.
A. "turn on discount sharing" is ok. This case: Has discount for many EC2 instances in one account, then want to share with other user. At E, create Organization, then share.

Question 495
A retail company uses a regional Amazon API Gateway API for its public REST APIs. The API Gateway endpoint is a custom domain name that points to an Amazon Route 53 alias record. A solutions architect needs to create a solution that has minimal effects on customers and minimal data loss to release the new version of APIs.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Create a canary release deployment stage for API Gateway. Deploy the latest API version. Point an appropriate percentage of traffic to the canary stage. After API verification, promote the canary stage to the production stage.
B.
Create a new API Gateway endpoint with a new version of the API in OpenAPI YAML file format. Use the import-to-update operation in merge mode into the API in API Gateway. Deploy the new version of the API to the production stage.
C.
Create a new API Gateway endpoint with a new version of the API in OpenAPI JSON file format. Use the import-to-update operation in overwrite mode into the API in API Gateway. Deploy the new version of the API to the production stage.
D.
Create a new API Gateway endpoint with new versions of the API definitions. Create a custom domain name for the new API Gateway API. Point the Route 53 alias record to the new API Gateway API custom domain name.

Answer: A

Explanation:
In a canary release deployment, total API traffic is separated at random into a production release and a canary release with a pre-configured ratio. Typically, the canary release receives a small percentage of API traffic and the production release takes up the rest. The updated API features are only visible to API traffic through the canary. You can adjust the canary traffic percentage to optimize test coverage or performance.

Question 496
A company wants to direct its users to a backup static error page if the company's primary website is unavailable. The primary website's DNS records are hosted in Amazon Route 53. The domain is pointing to an Application Load Balancer (ALB). The company needs a solution that minimizes changes and infrastructure overhead.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Update the Route 53 records to use a latency routing policy. Add a static error page that is hosted in an Amazon S3 bucket to the records so that the traffic is sent to the most responsive endpoints.
B.
Set up a Route 53 active-passive failover configuration. Direct traffic to a static error page that is hosted in an Amazon S3 bucket when Route 53 health checks determine that the ALB endpoint is unhealthy.
C.
Set up a Route 53 active-active configuration with the ALB and an Amazon EC2 instance that hosts a static error page as endpoints. Configure Route 53 to send requests to the instance only if the health checks fail for the ALB.
D.
Update the Route 53 records to use a multivalue answer routing policy. Create a health check. Direct traffic to the website if the health check passes. Direct traffic to a static error page that is hosted in Amazon S3 if the health check does not pass.

Answer: B?D?

Explanation:
B
Set up a Route 53 active-passive failover configuration. Direct traffic to a static error page that is hosted in an Amazon S3 bucket when Route 53 health checks determine that the ALB endpoint is unhealthy.

D
Setting up a Route 53 active-passive failover configuration with the ALB as the primary endpoint and an Amazon S3 static website as the passive endpoint meets the requirements with minimal overhead.
Route 53 health checks can monitor the ALB health. If the ALB becomes unhealthy, traffic will automatically failover to the S3 static website. This provides automatic failover with minimal configuration changes

Question 497
A recent analysis of a company's IT expenses highlights the need to reduce backup costs. The company's chief information officer wants to simplify the on-premises backup infrastructure and reduce costs by eliminating the use of physical backup tapes. The company must preserve the existing investment in the on-premises backup applications and workflows.
What should a solutions architect recommend?
A.
Set up AWS Storage Gateway to connect with the backup applications using the NFS interface.
B.
Set up an Amazon EFS file system that connects with the backup applications using the NFS interface.
C.
Set up an Amazon EFS file system that connects with the backup applications using the iSCSI interface.
D.
Set up AWS Storage Gateway to connect with the backup applications using the iSCSI-virtual tape library (VTL) interface.

Answer: D

Explanation:
Use Tape Gateway to replace physical tapes on premises with virtual tapes on AWS—reducing your data storage costs without changing your tape-based backup workflows. Tape Gateway supports all leading backup applications and caches virtual tapes on premises for low-latency data access. It compresses your tape data, encrypts it, and stores it in a virtual tape library in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). From there, you can transfer it to either Amazon S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval or Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive to help minimize your long-term storage costs.

Answer: C

Explanation:
Creating security group that allows inbound traffic from security group assigned to instances in private subnets ensures that only EC2 running in private subnets can access the RDS databases. By associating security group with DB, you restrict access to only instances that belong to designated security group.
A: This approach may help control routing within VPC, it does not address the specific access requirement between EC2 instances and RDS databases.
B: Using a deny rule in a security group can lead to complexities and potential misconfigurations. It is generally recommended to use allow rules to explicitly define access permissions.
D: Peering connections enable communication between different VPCs or VPCs in different regions, and they are not necessary for restricting access between subnets within the same VPC.

Question 502
A company is using AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) keys to encrypt AWS Lambda environment variables. A solutions architect needs to ensure that the required permissions are in place to decrypt and use the environment variables.
Which steps must the solutions architect take to implement the correct permissions? (Choose two.)
A.
Add AWS KMS permissions in the Lambda resource policy.
B.
Add AWS KMS permissions in the Lambda execution role.
C.
Add AWS KMS permissions in the Lambda function policy.
D.
Allow the Lambda execution role in the AWS KMS key policy.
E.
Allow the Lambda resource policy in the AWS KMS key policy.

Answer: BD

Explanation:
To decrypt environment variables encrypted with AWS KMS, Lambda needs to be granted permissions to call KMS APIs. This is done in two places:
The Lambda execution role needs kms:Decrypt and kms:GenerateDataKey permissions added. The execution role governs what AWS services the function code can access.
The KMS key policy needs to allow the Lambda execution role to have kms:Decrypt and kms:GenerateDataKey permissions for that specific key. This allows the execution role to use that particular key.

Question 503
A company has a financial application that produces reports. The reports average 50 KB in size and are stored in Amazon S3. The reports are frequently accessed during the first week after production and must be stored for several years. The reports must be retrievable within 6 hours.
Which solution meets these requirements MOST cost-effectively?
A.
Use S3 Standard. Use an S3 Lifecycle rule to transition the reports to S3 Glacier after 7 days.
B.
Use S3 Standard. Use an S3 Lifecycle rule to transition the reports to S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) after 7 days.
C.
Use S3 Intelligent-Tiering. Configure S3 Intelligent-Tiering to transition the reports to S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) and S3 Glacier.
D.
Use S3 Standard. Use an S3 Lifecycle rule to transition the reports to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 7 days.

Answer: A

Explanation:
Expedited Retrieval: Provides access to data within 1-5 minutes.
Standard Retrieval: Provides access to data within 3-5 hours.
Bulk Retrieval: Provides access to data within 5-12 hours.
Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive:
Standard Retrieval: Provides access to data within 12 hours.
Bulk Retrieval: Provides access to data within 48 hours.

Question 504
A company needs to optimize the cost of its Amazon EC2 instances. The company also needs to change the type and family of its EC2 instances every 2-3 months.
What should the company do to meet these requirements?
A.
Purchase Partial Upfront Reserved Instances for a 3-year term.
B.
Purchase a No Upfront Compute Savings Plan for a 1-year term.
C.
Purchase All Upfront Reserved Instances for a 1-year term.
D.
Purchase an All Upfront EC2 Instance Savings Plan for a 1-year term.

Answer: B

Explanation:
The company needs flexibility to change EC2 instance types and families every 2-3 months. This rules out Reserved Instances which lock you into an instance type and family for 1-3 years.
A Compute Savings Plan allows switching instance types and families freely within the term as needed. No Upfront is more flexible than All Upfront.
A 1-year term balances commitment and flexibility better than a 3-year term given the company's changing needs.
With No Upfront, the company only pays for usage monthly without an upfront payment. This optimizes cost.

Question 505
A solutions architect needs to review a company's Amazon S3 buckets to discover personally identifiable information (PII). The company stores the PII data in the us-east-1 Region and us-west-2 Region.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?
A.
Configure Amazon Macie in each Region. Create a job to analyze the data that is in Amazon S3.
B.
Configure AWS Security Hub for all Regions. Create an AWS Config rule to analyze the data that is in Amazon S3.
C.
Configure Amazon Inspector to analyze the data that is in Amazon S3.
D.
Configure Amazon GuardDuty to analyze the data that is in Amazon S3.

Answer: A

Explanation:
Amazon Macie is designed specifically for discovering and classifying sensitive data like PII in S3. This makes it the optimal service to use.
Macie can be enabled directly in the required Regions rather than enabling it across all Regions which is unnecessary. This minimizes overhead.
Macie can be set up to automatically scan the specified S3 buckets on a schedule. No need to create separate jobs.
Security Hub is for security monitoring across AWS accounts, not specific for PII discovery. More overhead than needed.
Inspector and GuardDuty are not built for PII discovery in S3 buckets. They provide broader security capabilities.

Question 506
A company's SAP application has a backend SQL Server database in an on-premises environment. The company wants to migrate its on-premises application and database server to AWS. The company needs an instance type that meets the high demands of its SAP database. On-premises performance data shows that both the SAP application and the database have high memory utilization.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Use the compute optimized instance family for the application. Use the memory optimized instance family for the database.
B.
Use the storage optimized instance family for both the application and the database.
C.
Use the memory optimized instance family for both the application and the database.
D.
Use the high performance computing (HPC) optimized instance family for the application. Use the memory optimized instance family for the database.

Answer: C

Explanation:
Since both the app and database have high memory needs, the memory optimized family like R5 instances meet those requirements well.
Using the same instance family simplifies management and operations, rather than mixing instance types.
Compute optimized instances may not provide enough memory for the SAP app's needs.
Storage optimized is overkill for the database's compute and memory needs.
HPC is overprovisioned for the SAP app.

Question 507
A company runs an application in a VPC with public and private subnets. The VPC extends across multiple Availability Zones. The application runs on Amazon EC2 instances in private subnets. The application uses an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue.
A solutions architect needs to design a secure solution to establish a connection between the EC2 instances and the SQS queue.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Implement an interface VPC endpoint for Amazon SQS. Configure the endpoint to use the private subnets. Add to the endpoint a security group that has an inbound access rule that allows traffic from the EC2 instances that are in the private subnets.
B.
Implement an interface VPC endpoint for Amazon SQS. Configure the endpoint to use the public subnets. Attach to the interface endpoint a VPC endpoint policy that allows access from the EC2 instances that are in the private subnets.
C.
Implement an interface VPC endpoint for Amazon SQS. Configure the endpoint to use the public subnets. Attach an Amazon SQS access policy to the interface VPC endpoint that allows requests from only a specified VPC endpoint.
D.
Implement a gateway endpoint for Amazon SQS. Add a NAT gateway to the private subnets. Attach an IAM role to the EC2 instances that allows access to the SQS queue.

Answer: A

Explanation:
An interface VPC endpoint is a private way to connect to AWS services without having to expose your VPC to the public internet. This is the most secure way to connect to Amazon SQS from the private subnets.
Configuring the endpoint to use the private subnets ensures that the traffic between the EC2 instances and the SQS queue is only within the VPC. This helps to protect the traffic from being intercepted by a malicious actor.
Adding a security group to the endpoint that has an inbound access rule that allows traffic from the EC2 instances that are in the private subnets further restricts the traffic to only the authorized sources. This helps to prevent unauthorized access to the SQS queue.

Question 508
A solutions architect is using an AWS CloudFormation template to deploy a three-tier web application. The web application consists of a web tier and an application tier that stores and retrieves user data in Amazon DynamoDB tables. The web and application tiers are hosted on Amazon EC2 instances, and the database tier is not publicly accessible. The application EC2 instances need to access the DynamoDB tables without exposing API credentials in the template.
What should the solutions architect do to meet these requirements?
A.
Create an IAM role to read the DynamoDB tables. Associate the role with the application instances by referencing an instance profile.
B.
Create an IAM role that has the required permissions to read and write from the DynamoDB tables. Add the role to the EC2 instance profile, and associate the instance profile with the application instances.
C.
Use the parameter section in the AWS CloudFormation template to have the user input access and secret keys from an already-created IAM user that has the required permissions to read and write from the DynamoDB tables.
D.
Create an IAM user in the AWS CloudFormation template that has the required permissions to read and write from the DynamoDB tables. Use the GetAtt function to retrieve the access and secret keys, and pass them to the application instances through the user data.

Answer: B

Explanation:
Option B is the correct approach to meet the requirements:
Create an IAM role with permissions to access DynamoDB
Add the IAM role to an EC2 Instance Profile
Associate the Instance Profile with the application EC2 instances
This allows the instances to assume the IAM role to obtain temporary credentials to access DynamoDB.

Question 509
A solutions architect manages an analytics application. The application stores large amounts of semistructured data in an Amazon S3 bucket. The solutions architect wants to use parallel data processing to process the data more quickly. The solutions architect also wants to use information that is stored in an Amazon Redshift database to enrich the data.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Use Amazon Athena to process the S3 data. Use AWS Glue with the Amazon Redshift data to enrich the S3 data.
B.
Use Amazon EMR to process the S3 data. Use Amazon EMR with the Amazon Redshift data to enrich the S3 data.
C.
Use Amazon EMR to process the S3 data. Use Amazon Kinesis Data Streams to move the S3 data into Amazon Redshift so that the data can be enriched.
D.
Use AWS Glue to process the S3 data. Use AWS Lake Formation with the Amazon Redshift data to enrich the S3 data.

Answer: B

Explanation:
Use Amazon EMR to process the semi-structured data in Amazon S3. EMR provides a managed Hadoop framework optimized for processing large datasets in S3.
EMR supports parallel data processing across multiple nodes to speed up the processing.
EMR can integrate directly with Amazon Redshift using the EMR-Redshift integration. This allows querying the Redshift data from EMR and joining it with the S3 data.
This enables enriching the semi-structured S3 data with the information stored in Redshift

Question 510
A company has two VPCs that are located in the us-west-2 Region within the same AWS account. The company needs to allow network traffic between these VPCs. Approximately 500 GB of data transfer will occur between the VPCs each month.
What is the MOST cost-effective solution to connect these VPCs?
A.
Implement AWS Transit Gateway to connect the VPCs. Update the route tables of each VPC to use the transit gateway for inter-VPC communication.
B.
Implement an AWS Site-to-Site VPN tunnel between the VPCs. Update the route tables of each VPC to use the VPN tunnel for inter-VPC communication.
C.
Set up a VPC peering connection between the VPCs. Update the route tables of each VPC to use the VPC peering connection for inter-VPC communication.
D.
Set up a 1 GB AWS Direct Connect connection between the VPCs. Update the route tables of each VPC to use the Direct Connect connection for inter-VPC communication.

Answer: C

Explanation:
VPC peering provides private connectivity between VPCs without using public IP space.
Data transferred between peered VPCs is free as long as they are in the same region.
500 GB/month inter-VPC data transfer fits within peering free tier.
Transit Gateway (Option A) incurs hourly charges plus data transfer fees. More costly than peering.
Site-to-Site VPN (Option B) incurs hourly charges and data transfer fees. More expensive than peering.
Direct Connect (Option D) has high hourly charges and would be overkill for this use case.

Question 511
A company hosts multiple applications on AWS for different product lines. The applications use different compute resources, including Amazon EC2 instances and Application Load Balancers. The applications run in different AWS accounts under the same organization in AWS Organizations across multiple AWS Regions. Teams for each product line have tagged each compute resource in the individual accounts.
The company wants more details about the cost for each product line from the consolidated billing feature in Organizations.
Which combination of steps will meet these requirements? (Choose two.)
A.
Select a specific AWS generated tag in the AWS Billing console.
B.
Select a specific user-defined tag in the AWS Billing console.
C.
Select a specific user-defined tag in the AWS Resource Groups console.
D.
Activate the selected tag from each AWS account.
E.
Activate the selected tag from the Organizations management account.

Answer: BE

Explanation:
User-defined tags were created by each product team to identify resources. Selecting the relevant tag in the Billing console will group costs.
The tag must be activated from the Organizations management account to consolidate billing across all accounts.
AWS generated tags are predefined by AWS and won't align to product lines.
Resource Groups (Option C) helps manage resources but not billing.
Activating the tag from each account (Option D) is not needed since Organizations centralizes billing.

Question 512
A company has registered its domain name with Amazon Route 53. The company uses Amazon API Gateway in the ca-central-1 Region as a public interface for its backend microservice APIs. Third-party services consume the APIs securely. The company wants to design its API Gateway URL with the company's domain name and corresponding certificate so that the third-party services can use HTTPS.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Create stage variables in API Gateway with Name="Endpoint-URL" and Value="Company Domain Name" to overwrite the default URL. Import the public certificate associated with the company's domain name into AWS Certificate Manager (ACM).
B.
Create Route 53 DNS records with the company's domain name. Point the alias record to the Regional API Gateway stage endpoint. Import the public certificate associated with the company's domain name into AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) in the us-east-1 Region.
C.
Create a Regional API Gateway endpoint. Associate the API Gateway endpoint with the company's domain name. Import the public certificate associated with the company's domain name into AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) in the same Region. Attach the certificate to the API Gateway endpoint. Configure Route 53 to route traffic to the API Gateway endpoint.
D.
Create a Regional API Gateway endpoint. Associate the API Gateway endpoint with the company's domain name. Import the public certificate associated with the company's domain name into AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) in the us-east-1 Region. Attach the certificate to the API Gateway APIs. Create Route 53 DNS records with the company's domain name. Point an A record to the company's domain name.

Answer: C

Explanation:
Option C encompasses all the necessary steps to design the API Gateway URL with the company's domain name and enable secure HTTPS access using the appropriate certificate.
A. This approach does not involve using the company's domain name or a custom certificate. It does not provide a solution for enabling HTTPS access with a corresponding certificate.
B. It suggests importing the certificate into ACM in the us-east-1 Region, which may not align with the desired ca-central-1 Region for this scenario. It's important to use ACM in the same Region where API Gateway is deployed to simplify certificate management.
D. It suggests importing the certificate into ACM in the us-east-1 Region, which again does not align with the desired ca-central-1 Region. Additionally, it mentions attaching the certificate to API Gateway, which is not necessary for achieving the desired outcome of enabling HTTPS access for the API Gateway endpoint.

Question 513
A company's solutions architect is designing an AWS multi-account solution that uses AWS Organizations. The solutions architect has organized the company's accounts into organizational units (OUs).
The solutions architect needs a solution that will identify any changes to the OU hierarchy. The solution also needs to notify the company's operations team of any changes.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?
A.
Provision the AWS accounts by using AWS Control Tower. Use account drift notifications to identify the changes to the OU hierarchy.
B.
Provision the AWS accounts by using AWS Control Tower. Use AWS Config aggregated rules to identify the changes to the OU hierarchy.
C.
Use AWS Service Catalog to create accounts in Organizations. Use an AWS CloudTrail organization trail to identify the changes to the OU hierarchy.
D.
Use AWS CloudFormation templates to create accounts in Organizations. Use the drift detection operation on a stack to identify the changes to the OU hierarchy.

Answer: A

Explanation:
The key advantages you highlight of Control Tower are convincing:
Fully managed service simplifies multi-account setup.
Built-in account drift notifications detect OU changes automatically.
More scalable and less complex than Config rules or CloudTrail.
Better security and compliance guardrails than custom options.
Lower operational overhead compared to other solution

Question 514
A company's website handles millions of requests each day, and the number of requests continues to increase. A solutions architect needs to improve the response time of the web application. The solutions architect determines that the application needs to decrease latency when retrieving product details from the Amazon DynamoDB table.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST amount of operational overhead?
A.
Set up a DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) cluster. Route all read requests through DAX.
B.
Set up Amazon ElastiCache for Redis between the DynamoDB table and the web application. Route all read requests through Redis.
C.
Set up Amazon ElastiCache for Memcached between the DynamoDB table and the web application. Route all read requests through Memcached.
D.
Set up Amazon DynamoDB Streams on the table, and have AWS Lambda read from the table and populate Amazon ElastiCache. Route all read requests through ElastiCache.

Answer: A

Explanation:
DAX provides a DynamoDB-compatible caching layer to reduce read latency. It is purpose-built for accelerating DynamoDB workloads.
Using DAX requires minimal application changes - only read requests are routed through it.
DAX handles caching logic automatically without needing complex integration code.
ElastiCache Redis/Memcached (Options B/C) require more integration work to sync DynamoDB data.
Using Lambda and Streams to populate ElastiCache (Option D) is a complex event-driven approach requiring ongoing maintenance.
DAX plugs in seamlessly to accelerate DynamoDB with very little operational overhead

Question 515
A solutions architect needs to ensure that API calls to Amazon DynamoDB from Amazon EC2 instances in a VPC do not travel across the internet.
Which combination of steps should the solutions architect take to meet this requirement? (Choose two.)
A.
Create a route table entry for the endpoint.
B.
Create a gateway endpoint for DynamoDB.
C.
Create an interface endpoint for Amazon EC2.
D.
Create an elastic network interface for the endpoint in each of the subnets of the VPC.
E.
Create a security group entry in the endpoint's security group to provide access.

Answer: AB?BE?

Explanation:
AB
Traffic from your VPC to Amazon S3 or DynamoDB is routed to the gateway endpoint. Each subnet route table must have a route that sends traffic destined for the service to the gateway endpoint using the prefix list for the service.
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/vpc-endpoints-ddb.html

BE
A gateway endpoint for DynamoDB enables private connectivity between DynamoDB and the VPC. This allows EC2 instances to access DynamoDB APIs without traversing the internet.
A security group entry is needed to allow the EC2 instances access to the DynamoDB endpoint over the VPC.
An interface endpoint is used for services like S3 and Systems Manager, not DynamoDB.
Route table entries route traffic within a VPC but do not affect external connectivity.
Elastic network interfaces are not needed for gateway endpoints.

Question 516
A company runs its applications on both Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) clusters and on-premises Kubernetes clusters. The company wants to view all clusters and workloads from a central location.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?
A.
Use Amazon CloudWatch Container Insights to collect and group the cluster information.
B.
Use Amazon EKS Connector to register and connect all Kubernetes clusters.
C.
Use AWS Systems Manager to collect and view the cluster information.
D.
Use Amazon EKS Anywhere as the primary cluster to view the other clusters with native Kubernetes commands.

Answer: B

Explanation:
EKS Connector allows registering external Kubernetes clusters (on-premises and otherwise) with Amazon EKS
This provides a unified view and management of all clusters within the EKS console.
EKS Connector handles keeping resources in sync across connected clusters.
This centralized approach minimizes operational overhead compared to using separate tools.
CloudWatch Container Insights (Option A) only provides metrics and logs, not cluster management.
Systems Manager (Option C) is more general purpose and does not natively integrate with EKS.
EKS Anywhere (Option D) would not provide a single pane of glass for external clusters.

Question 517
A company is building an ecommerce application and needs to store sensitive customer information. The company needs to give customers the ability to complete purchase transactions on the website. The company also needs to ensure that sensitive customer data is protected, even from database administrators.
Which solution meets these requirements?
A.
Store sensitive data in an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume. Use EBS encryption to encrypt the data. Use an IAM instance role to restrict access.
B.
Store sensitive data in Amazon RDS for MySQL. Use AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) client-side encryption to encrypt the data.
C.
Store sensitive data in Amazon S3. Use AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) server-side encryption to encrypt the data. Use S3 bucket policies to restrict access.
D.
Store sensitive data in Amazon FSx for Windows Server. Mount the file share on application servers. Use Windows file permissions to restrict access.

Answer: B

Explanation:
RDS MySQL provides a fully managed database service well suited for an ecommerce application.
AWS KMS client-side encryption allows encrypting sensitive data before it hits the database. The data remains encrypted at rest.
This protects sensitive customer data from database admins and privileged users.
EBS encryption (Option A) protects data at rest but not in use. IAM roles don't prevent admin access.
S3 (Option C) encrypts data at rest on the server side. Bucket policies don't restrict admin access.
FSx file permissions (Option D) don't prevent admin access to unencrypted data.

Question 518
A company has an on-premises MySQL database that handles transactional data. The company is migrating the database to the AWS Cloud. The migrated database must maintain compatibility with the company's applications that use the database. The migrated database also must scale automatically during periods of increased demand.
Which migration solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Use native MySQL tools to migrate the database to Amazon RDS for MySQL. Configure elastic storage scaling.
B.
Migrate the database to Amazon Redshift by using the mysqldump utility. Turn on Auto Scaling for the Amazon Redshift cluster.
C.
Use AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) to migrate the database to Amazon Aurora. Turn on Aurora Auto Scaling.
D.
Use AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) to migrate the database to Amazon DynamoDB. Configure an Auto Scaling policy.

Answer: C

Explanation:
DMS provides an easy migration path from MySQL to Aurora while minimizing downtime.
Aurora is a MySQL-compatible relational database service that will maintain compatibility with the company's applications.
Aurora Auto Scaling allows the database to automatically scale up and down based on demand to handle increased workloads.
RDS MySQL (Option A) does not scale as well as the Aurora architecture.
Redshift (Option B) is for analytics, not transactional data, and may not be compatible.
DynamoDB (Option D) is a NoSQL datastore and lacks MySQL compatibility.

Question 519
A company runs multiple Amazon EC2 Linux instances in a VPC across two Availability Zones. The instances host applications that use a hierarchical directory structure. The applications need to read and write rapidly and concurrently to shared storage.
What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements?
A.
Create an Amazon S3 bucket. Allow access from all the EC2 instances in the VPC.
B.
Create an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file system. Mount the EFS file system from each EC2 instance.
C.
Create a file system on a Provisioned IOPS SSD (io2) Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume. Attach the EBS volume to all the EC2 instances.
D.
Create file systems on Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes that are attached to each EC2 instance. Synchronize the EBS volumes across the different EC2 instances.

Answer: B

Explanation:
EFS provides a scalable, high performance NFS file system that can be concurrently accessed from multiple EC2 instances.
It supports the hierarchical directory structure needed by the applications.
EFS is elastic, growing and shrinking automatically as needed.
It can be accessed from instances across AZs, meeting the shared storage requirement.
S3 object storage (option A) lacks the file system semantics needed by the apps.
EBS volumes (options C and D) are attached to a single instance and would require replication and syncing to share across instances.
EFS is purpose-built for this use case of a shared file system across Linux instances and aligns best with the performance, concurrency, and availability needs.

Question 520
A solutions architect is designing a workload that will store hourly energy consumption by business tenants in a building. The sensors will feed a database through HTTP requests that will add up usage for each tenant. The solutions architect must use managed services when possible. The workload will receive more features in the future as the solutions architect adds independent components.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?
A.
Use Amazon API Gateway with AWS Lambda functions to receive the data from the sensors, process the data, and store the data in an Amazon DynamoDB table.
B.
Use an Elastic Load Balancer that is supported by an Auto Scaling group of Amazon EC2 instances to receive and process the data from the sensors. Use an Amazon S3 bucket to store the processed data.
C.
Use Amazon API Gateway with AWS Lambda functions to receive the data from the sensors, process the data, and store the data in a Microsoft SQL Server Express database on an Amazon EC2 instance.
D.
Use an Elastic Load Balancer that is supported by an Auto Scaling group of Amazon EC2 instances to receive and process the data from the sensors. Use an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) shared file system to store the processed data.

Answer: A

Explanation:
° API Gateway removes the need to manage servers to receive the HTTP requests from sensors
° Lambda functions provide a serverless compute layer to process data as needed
° DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database that scales automatically
° This serverless architecture has minimal operational overhead to manage
° Options B, C, and D all require managing EC2 instances which increases ops workload
° Option C also adds SQL Server admin tasks and licensing costs
° Option D uses EFS file storage which requires capacity planning and management

Question 521
A solutions architect is designing the storage architecture for a new web application used for storing and viewing engineering drawings. All application components will be deployed on the AWS infrastructure.
The application design must support caching to minimize the amount of time that users wait for the engineering drawings to load. The application must be able to store petabytes of data.
Which combination of storage and caching should the solutions architect use?
A.
Amazon S3 with Amazon CloudFront
B.
Amazon S3 Glacier with Amazon ElastiCache
C.
Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes with Amazon CloudFront
D.
AWS Storage Gateway with Amazon ElastiCache

Answer: A

Explanation:
S3 provides highly durable and scalable object storage capable of handling petabytes of data cost-effectively.
CloudFront can be used to cache S3 content at the edge, minimizing latency for users and speeding up access to the engineering drawings.
The global CloudFront edge network is ideal for caching large amounts of static media like drawings.
EBS provides block storage but lacks the scale and durability of S3 for large media files.
Glacier is cheaper archival storage but has higher latency unsuited for frequent access.
Storage Gateway and ElastiCache may play a role but do not align as well to the main requirements.

Question 522
An Amazon EventBridge rule targets a third-party API. The third-party API has not received any incoming traffic. A solutions architect needs to determine whether the rule conditions are being met and if the rule's target is being invoked.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Check for metrics in Amazon CloudWatch in the namespace for AWS/Events.
B.
Review events in the Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) dead-letter queue.
C.
Check for the events in Amazon CloudWatch Logs.
D.
Check the trails in AWS CloudTrail for the EventBridge events.

Answer: A?C?

Explanation:
A
"EventBridge sends metrics to Amazon CloudWatch every minute for everything from the number of matched events to the number of times a target is invoked by a rule."
from https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-monitoring.html
B: SQS, irrelevant
C: 'Check for events', this wording is confusing but could mean something in wrong context. I would have chosen C if A wasn't an option
D: CloudTrail is for AWS resource monitoring so irrelevant

C
Option A, "Check for metrics in Amazon CloudWatch in the namespace for AWS/Events," primarily provides aggregated metrics related to EventBridge, but it may not give detailed information about individual events or their specific content. Metrics in CloudWatch can give you an overview of how many events are being processed, but for detailed inspection of events and their conditions, checking CloudWatch Logs (option C) is more appropriate.
CloudWatch Logs allow you to see the actual event data and details, providing a more granular view that is useful for troubleshooting and understanding the specifics of why a third-party API is not receiving incoming traffic.

Question 523
A company is running a popular social media website. The website gives users the ability to upload images to share with other users. The company wants to make sure that the images do not contain inappropriate content. The company needs a solution that minimizes development effort.
What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements?
A.
Use Amazon Comprehend to detect inappropriate content. Use human review for low-confidence predictions.
B.
Use Amazon Rekognition to detect inappropriate content. Use human review for low-confidence predictions.
C.
Use Amazon SageMaker to detect inappropriate content. Use ground truth to label low-confidence predictions.
D.
Use AWS Fargate to deploy a custom machine learning model to detect inappropriate content. Use ground truth to label low-confidence predictions.

Answer: B

Explanation:
Using Amazon Rekognition for content moderation is a cost-effective and efficient solution that reduces the need for developing and training custom machine learning models, making it the best option in terms of minimizing development effort.
A. Amazon Comprehend is a natural language processing service provided by AWS, primarily focused on text analysis rather than image analysis.
C. Amazon SageMaker is a comprehensive machine learning service that allows you to build, train, and deploy custom machine learning models. It requires significant development effort to build and train a custom model. In addition, utilizing ground truth to label low-confidence predictions would further add to the development complexity and maintenance overhead.
D. Similar to C, using AWS Fargate to deploy a custom machine learning model requires significant development effort.

Question 524
A company has a large workload that runs every Friday evening. The workload runs on Amazon EC2 instances that are in two Availability Zones in the us-east-1 Region. Normally, the company must run no more than two instances at all times. However, the company wants to scale up to six instances each Friday to handle a regularly repeating increased workload.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?
A.
Create a reminder in Amazon EventBridge to scale the instances.
B.
Create an Auto Scaling group that has a scheduled action.
C.
Create an Auto Scaling group that uses manual scaling.
D.
Create an Auto Scaling group that uses automatic scaling.

Answer: B

Explanation:
Auto Scaling scheduled actions allow defining specific dates/times to scale out or in. This can be used to scale to 6 instances every Friday evening automatically.
Scheduled scaling removes the need for manual intervention to scale up/down for the workload.
EventBridge reminders and manual scaling require human involvement each week adding overhead.
Automatic scaling responds to demand and may not align perfectly to scale out every Friday without additional tuning.
Scheduled Auto Scaling actions provide the automation needed to scale for the weekly workload without ongoing operational overhead.

Question 525
A company is creating a REST API. The company has strict requirements for the use of TLS. The company requires TLSv1.3 on the API endpoints. The company also requires a specific public third-party certificate authority (CA) to sign the TLS certificate.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.

D.
Create a certificate in AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) that is signed by the third-party CA. Create an AWS Lambda function with a Lambda function URL. Configure the Lambda function URL to use the certificate.

Answer: A

Explanation:
Custom Certificate: Allows you to use a certificate signed by the third-party CA.
TLSv1.3 Support: API Gateway supports TLSv1.3 for custom domains.
Configuration: You can import the third-party CA certificate into ACM and configure API Gateway to use this certificate with a custom domain.
This approach meets all the specified requirements by allowing the use of a third-party CA-signed certificate and ensuring the API endpoints use TLSv1.3.

Question 526
A company runs an application on AWS. The application receives inconsistent amounts of usage. The application uses AWS Direct Connect to connect to an on-premises MySQL-compatible database. The on-premises database consistently uses a minimum of 2 GiB of memory.
The company wants to migrate the on-premises database to a managed AWS service. The company wants to use auto scaling capabilities to manage unexpected workload increases.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST administrative overhead?
A.
Provision an Amazon DynamoDB database with default read and write capacity settings.
B.
Provision an Amazon Aurora database with a minimum capacity of 1 Aurora capacity unit (ACU).
C.
Provision an Amazon Aurora Serverless v2 database with a minimum capacity of 1 Aurora capacity unit (ACU).
D.
Provision an Amazon RDS for MySQL database with 2 GiB of memory.

Answer: C

Explanation:
Aurora Serverless v2 provides auto-scaling so the database can handle inconsistent workloads and spikes automatically without admin intervention.
It can scale down to zero when not in use to minimize costs.
The minimum 1 ACU capacity is sufficient to replace the on-prem 2 GiB database based on the info given.
Serverless capabilities reduce admin overhead for capacity management.
DynamoDB lacks MySQL compatibility and requires more hands-on management.
RDS and provisioned Aurora require manually resizing instances to scale, increasing admin overhead.

Question 527
A company wants to use an event-driven programming model with AWS Lambda. The company wants to reduce startup latency for Lambda functions that run on Java 11. The company does not have strict latency requirements for the applications. The company wants to reduce cold starts and outlier latencies when a function scales up.
Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?
A.
Configure Lambda provisioned concurrency.
B.
Increase the timeout of the Lambda functions.
C.
Increase the memory of the Lambda functions.
D.
Configure Lambda SnapStart.

Answer: D

Explanation:
SnapStart keeps functions initialized and ready to respond quickly, eliminating cold starts.
SnapStart is optimized for applications without aggressive latency needs, reducing costs.
It scales automatically to match traffic spikes, eliminating outliers when scaling up.
SnapStart is a native Lambda feature with no additional charges, keeping costs low.
Provisioned concurrency incurs charges for always-on capacity reserved. More costly than SnapStart.
Increasing timeout and memory do not directly improve startup performance like SnapStart.

Question 528
A financial services company launched a new application that uses an Amazon RDS for MySQL database. The company uses the application to track stock market trends. The company needs to operate the application for only 2 hours at the end of each week. The company needs to optimize the cost of running the database.
Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?
A.
Migrate the existing RDS for MySQL database to an Aurora Serverless v2 MySQL database cluster.
B.
Migrate the existing RDS for MySQL database to an Aurora MySQL database cluster.
C.
Migrate the existing RDS for MySQL database to an Amazon EC2 instance that runs MySQL. Purchase an instance reservation for the EC2 instance.
D.
Migrate the existing RDS for MySQL database to an Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) cluster that uses MySQL container images to run tasks.

Answer: A

Explanation:
Aurora Serverless v2 scales compute capacity automatically based on actual usage, down to zero when not in use. This minimizes costs for intermittent usage.
Since it only runs for 2 hours per week, the application is ideal for a serverless architecture like Aurora Serverless.
Aurora Serverless v2 charges per second when the database is active, unlike RDS which charges hourly.
Aurora Serverless provides higher availability than self-managed MySQL on EC2 or ECS.
Using reserved EC2 instances or ECS still incurs charges when not in use versus the fine-grained scaling of serverless.
Standard Aurora clusters have a minimum capacity unlike the auto-scaling serverless architecture.

Question 529
A company deploys its applications on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) behind an Application Load Balancer in an AWS Region. The application needs to store data in a PostgreSQL database engine. The company wants the data in the database to be highly available. The company also needs increased capacity for read workloads.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the MOST operational efficiency?
A.
Create an Amazon DynamoDB database table configured with global tables.
B.
Create an Amazon RDS database with Multi-AZ deployments.
C.
Create an Amazon RDS database with Multi-AZ DB cluster deployment.
D.
Create an Amazon RDS database configured with cross-Region read replicas.

Answer: C

Explanation:
RDS Multi-AZ DB cluster deployments provide high availability, automatic failover, and increased read capacity.
A multi-AZ cluster automatically handles replicating data across AZs in a single region.
This maintains operational efficiency as it is natively managed by RDS without needing external replication.
DynamoDB global tables involve complex provisioning and requires app changes.
RDS read replicas require manual setup and management of replication.
RDS Multi-AZ clustering is purpose-built by AWS for HA PostgreSQL deployments and balancing read workloads.

Question 530
A company is building a RESTful serverless web application on AWS by using Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda. The users of this web application will be geographically distributed, and the company wants to reduce the latency of API requests to these users.
Which type of endpoint should a solutions architect use to meet these requirements?
A.
Private endpoint
B.
Regional endpoint
C.
Interface VPC endpoint
D.
Edge-optimized endpoint

Answer: D

Explanation:
API Gateway - Endpoint Types
• Edge-Optimized (default): For global clients
• Requests are routed through the CloudFront Edge locations (improves latency)
• The API Gateway still lives in only one region
• Regional:
• For clients within the same region
• Could manually combine with CloudFront (more control over the caching
strategies and the distribution)
• Private:
• Can only be accessed from your VPC using an interface VPC endpoint (ENI)
• Use a resource policy to define access

Question 531
A company uses an Amazon CloudFront distribution to serve content pages for its website. The company needs to ensure that clients use a TLS certificate when accessing the company's website. The company wants to automate the creation and renewal of the TLS certificates.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the MOST operational efficiency?
A.
Use a CloudFront security policy to create a certificate.
B.
Use a CloudFront origin access control (OAC) to create a certificate.
C.
Use AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) to create a certificate. Use DNS validation for the domain.
D.
Use AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) to create a certificate. Use email validation for the domain.

Answer: C

Explanation:
AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) provides free public TLS/SSL certificates and handles certificate renewals automatically.
Using DNS validation with ACM is operationally efficient since it automatically makes changes to Route 53 rather than requiring manual validation steps.
ACM integrates natively with CloudFront distributions for delivering HTTPS content.
CloudFront security policies and origin access controls do not issue TLS certificates.
Email validation requires manual steps to approve the domain validation emails for each renewal.

Question 532
A company deployed a serverless application that uses Amazon DynamoDB as a database layer. The application has experienced a large increase in users. The company wants to improve database response time from milliseconds to microseconds and to cache requests to the database.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?
A.
Use DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX).
B.
Migrate the database to Amazon Redshift.
C.
Migrate the database to Amazon RDS.
D.
Use Amazon ElastiCache for Redis.

Answer: A

Explanation:
DAX is least operations overhead.
B: Redshift, although powerful, but is for analytics 
C: Downgrading to RDS won't help
D: EC for Redis is more for persistent caching so would be good but lot of operational overhead

Question 533
A company runs an application that uses Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL. The application receives traffic only on weekdays during business hours. The company wants to optimize costs and reduce operational overhead based on this usage.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Use the Instance Scheduler on AWS to configure start and stop schedules.
B.
Turn off automatic backups. Create weekly manual snapshots of the database.
C.
Create a custom AWS Lambda function to start and stop the database based on minimum CPU utilization.
D.
Purchase All Upfront reserved DB instances.

Answer: A

Explanation:
The Instance Scheduler on AWS solution automates the starting and stopping of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) and Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) instances.
This solution helps reduce operational costs by stopping resources that are not in use and starting them when they are needed. The cost savings can be significant if you leave all of your instances running at full utilization continuously.

Question 534
A company wants to run its critical applications in containers to meet requirements for scalability and availability. The company prefers to focus on maintenance of the critical applications. The company does not want to be responsible for provisioning and managing the underlying infrastructure that runs the containerized workload.
What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements?
A.
Use Amazon EC2 instances, and install Docker on the instances.
B.
Use Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) on Amazon EC2 worker nodes.
C.
Use Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) on AWS Fargate.
D.
Use Amazon EC2 instances from an Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS)-optimized Amazon Machine Image (AMI).

Answer: C

Explanation:
Using ECS on Fargate allows you to run containers without the need to manage the underlying infrastructure. Fargate abstracts away the underlying EC2 and provides serverless compute for containers.
A. This option would require manual provisioning and management of EC2, as well as installing and configuring Docker on those instances. It would introduce additional overhead and responsibilities for maintaining the underlying infrastructure.
B. While this option leverages ECS to manage containers, it still requires provisioning and managing EC2 to serve as worker nodes. It adds complexity and maintenance overhead compared to the serverless nature of Fargate.
D. This option still involves managing and provisioning EC2, even though an ECS-optimized AMI simplifies the process of setting up EC2 for running ECS. It does not provide the level of serverless abstraction and ease of management offered by Fargate.

Question 535
A company uses locally attached storage to run a latency-sensitive application on premises. The company is using a lift and shift method to move the application to the AWS Cloud. The company does not want to change the application architecture.
Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?
A.
Configure an Auto Scaling group with an Amazon EC2 instance. Use an Amazon FSx for Lustre file system to run the application.
B.
Host the application on an Amazon EC2 instance. Use an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) GP2 volume to run the application.
C.
Configure an Auto Scaling group with an Amazon EC2 instance. Use an Amazon FSx for OpenZFS file system to run the application.
D.
Host the application on an Amazon EC2 instance. Use an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) GP3 volume to run the application.

Answer: D

Explanation:
GP3 is preferable over GP2, FSx for Lustre, and FSx for OpenZFS is clear and convincing:
GP3 offers identical latency performance to GP2 at a lower price point.
FSx options are higher performance but more expensive and require application changes.
GP3 aligns better with lift and shift needs as a directly attached block storage volume.

Question 536
A company runs a stateful production application on Amazon EC2 instances. The application requires at least two EC2 instances to always be running.
A solutions architect needs to design a highly available and fault-tolerant architecture for the application. The solutions architect creates an Auto Scaling group of EC2 instances.
Which set of additional steps should the solutions architect take to meet these requirements?
A.
Set the Auto Scaling group's minimum capacity to two. Deploy one On-Demand Instance in one Availability Zone and one On-Demand Instance in a second Availability Zone.
B.
Set the Auto Scaling group's minimum capacity to four. Deploy two On-Demand Instances in one Availability Zone and two On-Demand Instances in a second Availability Zone.
C.
Set the Auto Scaling group's minimum capacity to two. Deploy four Spot Instances in one Availability Zone.
D.
Set the Auto Scaling group's minimum capacity to four. Deploy two On-Demand Instances in one Availability Zone and two Spot Instances in a second Availability Zone.

Answer: A?B?

Explanation:
A
Highly available = 2 AZ, and then 2 EC2 instances always running is 1 EC2 in each AZ. If an entire AZ fails, SacalinGroup deploy the minimun instances (2) on the running AZ

B
By setting the Auto Scaling group's minimum capacity to four, the architect ensures that there are always at least two running instances. Deploying two On-Demand Instances in each of two Availability Zones ensures that the application is highly available and fault-tolerant. If one Availability Zone becomes unavailable, the application can still run in the other Availability Zone.

Question 537
An ecommerce company uses Amazon Route 53 as its DNS provider. The company hosts its website on premises and in the AWS Cloud. The company's on-premises data center is near the us-west-1 Region. The company uses the eu-central-1 Region to host the website. The company wants to minimize load time for the website as much as possible.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Set up a geolocation routing policy. Send the traffic that is near us-west-1 to the on-premises data center. Send the traffic that is near eu-central-1 to eu-central-1.
B.
Set up a simple routing policy that routes all traffic that is near eu-central-1 to eu-central-1 and routes all traffic that is near the on-premises datacenter to the on-premises data center.
C.
Set up a latency routing policy. Associate the policy with us-west-1.
D.
Set up a weighted routing policy. Split the traffic evenly between eu-central-1 and the on-premises data center.

Answer: A

Explanation:
Geolocation routing allows you to route users to the closest endpoint based on their geographic location. This will provide the lowest latency.
Routing us-west-1 traffic to the on-premises data center minimizes latency for those users since it is also located near there.
Routing eu-central-1 traffic to the eu-central-1 AWS region minimizes latency for users nearby.
This achieves routing users to the closest endpoint on a geographic basis to optimize for low latency.

Question 538
A company has 5 PB of archived data on physical tapes. The company needs to preserve the data on the tapes for another 10 years for compliance purposes. The company wants to migrate to AWS in the next 6 months. The data center that stores the tapes has a 1 Gbps uplink internet connectivity.
Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?
A.
Read the data from the tapes on premises. Stage the data in a local NFS storage. Use AWS DataSync to migrate the data to Amazon S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval.
B.
Use an on-premises backup application to read the data from the tapes and to write directly to Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive.
C.
Order multiple AWS Snowball devices that have Tape Gateway. Copy the physical tapes to virtual tapes in Snowball. Ship the Snowball devices to AWS. Create a lifecycle policy to move the tapes to Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive.
D.
Configure an on-premises Tape Gateway. Create virtual tapes in the AWS Cloud. Use backup software to copy the physical tape to the virtual tape.

Answer: C

Explanation:
5PB over 1GB connection will take approximately 15 months so anything with "transfer" is invalid. ABD are not practical.

Question 539
A company is deploying an application that processes large quantities of data in parallel. The company plans to use Amazon EC2 instances for the workload. The network architecture must be configurable to prevent groups of nodes from sharing the same underlying hardware.
Which networking solution meets these requirements?
A.
Run the EC2 instances in a spread placement group.
B.
Group the EC2 instances in separate accounts.
C.
Configure the EC2 instances with dedicated tenancy.
D.
Configure the EC2 instances with shared tenancy.

Answer: A

Explanation:
A, spread placement group does exactly what is required here.
Not C and D, tenancy determines whether the hardware is shared with other customers or not, it has nothing to with your own instances sharing hardware. (On the contrary, dedicated tenancy would spread your EC2 instances across as little nodes as possible.)
Not B, accounts have nothing to do with the issue.

Question 540
A solutions architect is designing a disaster recovery (DR) strategy to provide Amazon EC2 capacity in a failover AWS Region. Business requirements state that the DR strategy must meet capacity in the failover Region.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Purchase On-Demand Instances in the failover Region.
B.
Purchase an EC2 Savings Plan in the failover Region.
C.
Purchase regional Reserved Instances in the failover Region.
D.
Purchase a Capacity Reservation in the failover Region.

Answer: D

Explanation:
Purchase a Capacity Reservation in the failover Region:
A Capacity Reservation allows you to reserve a specific amount of EC2 instance capacity in a given region without purchasing specific instances. This reserved capacity is dedicated to your account and can be utilized for launching instances when needed. Capacity Reservations offer flexibility, allowing you to launch different instance types and sizes within the reserved capacity.
Purchase regional Reserved Instances in the failover Region:
Regional Reserved Instances involve paying an upfront fee to reserve a certain number of specific EC2 instances in a particular region. These reserved instances are of a predefined type and size, providing a more traditional reservation model. Regional Reserved Instances are specific to a designated region and ensure that the reserved instances of a particular specification are available when needed.

Question 541
A company has five organizational units (OUs) as part of its organization in AWS Organizations. Each OU correlates to the five businesses that the company owns. The company's research and development (R&D) business is separating from the company and will need its own organization. A solutions architect creates a separate new management account for this purpose.
What should the solutions architect do next in the new management account?
A.
Have the R&D AWS account be part of both organizations during the transition.
B.
Invite the R&D AWS account to be part of the new organization after the R&D AWS account has left the prior organization.
C.
Create a new R&D AWS account in the new organization. Migrate resources from the prior R&D AWS account to the new R&D AWS account.
D.
Have the R&D AWS account join the new organization. Make the new management account a member of the prior organization.

Answer: B

Explanation:
An account can only join another org when it leaves the first org.
A is wrong as it's not possible
C that's a new account so not really a migration
D The R&D department is separating from the company so you don't want the OU to join via nesting

Question 542
A company is designing a solution to capture customer activity in different web applications to process analytics and make predictions. Customer activity in the web applications is unpredictable and can increase suddenly. The company requires a solution that integrates with other web applications. The solution must include an authorization step for security purposes.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Configure a Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB) in front of an Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) container instance that stores the information that the company receives in an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file system. Authorization is resolved at the GWLB.
B.
Configure an Amazon API Gateway endpoint in front of an Amazon Kinesis data stream that stores the information that the company receives in an Amazon S3 bucket. Use an AWS Lambda function to resolve authorization.
C.
Configure an Amazon API Gateway endpoint in front of an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose that stores the information that the company receives in an Amazon S3 bucket. Use an API Gateway Lambda authorizer to resolve authorization.
D.
Configure a Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB) in front of an Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) container instance that stores the information that the company receives on an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file system. Use an AWS Lambda function to resolve authorization.

Answer: C

Explanation:
This solution meets the requirements in the following ways:
Handles Unpredictable Traffic: Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose can handle variable amounts of streaming data and automatically scales to accommodate sudden increases in traffic.
Integration with Web Applications: Amazon API Gateway provides a RESTful API endpoint for integrating with web applications.
Authorization: An API Gateway Lambda authorizer provides the necessary authorization step to secure API access.
Data Storage: Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose can deliver data directly to an Amazon S3 bucket for storage, making it suitable for long-term analytics and predictions.

Question 543
An ecommerce company wants a disaster recovery solution for its Amazon RDS DB instances that run Microsoft SQL Server Enterprise Edition. The company's current recovery point objective (RPO) and recovery time objective (RTO) are 24 hours.
Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?
A.
Create a cross-Region read replica and promote the read replica to the primary instance.
B.
Use AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) to create RDS cross-Region replication.
C.
Use cross-Region replication every 24 hours to copy native backups to an Amazon S3 bucket.
D.
Copy automatic snapshots to another Region every 24 hours.

Answer: D

Explanation:
Amazon RDS creates and saves automated backups of your DB instance or Multi-AZ DB cluster during the backup window of your DB instance. RDS creates a storage volume snapshot of your DB instance, backing up the entire DB instance and not just individual databases. RDS saves the automated backups of your DB instance according to the backup retention period that you specify. If necessary, you can recover your DB instance to any point in time during the backup retention period.

Question 544
A company runs a web application on Amazon EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group behind an Application Load Balancer that has sticky sessions enabled. The web server currently hosts the user session state. The company wants to ensure high availability and avoid user session state loss in the event of a web server outage.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Use an Amazon ElastiCache for Memcached instance to store the session data. Update the application to use ElastiCache for Memcached to store the session state.
B.
Use Amazon ElastiCache for Redis to store the session state. Update the application to use ElastiCache for Redis to store the session state.
C.
Use an AWS Storage Gateway cached volume to store session data. Update the application to use AWS Storage Gateway cached volume to store the session state.
D.
Use Amazon RDS to store the session state. Update the application to use Amazon RDS to store the session state.

Answer: B

Explanation:
ElastiCache Redis provides in-memory caching that can deliver microsecond latency for session data.
Redis supports replication and multi-AZ which can provide high availability for the cache.
The application can be updated to store session data in ElastiCache Redis rather than locally on the web servers.
If a web server fails, the user can be routed via the load balancer to another web server which can retrieve their session data from the highly available ElastiCache Redis cluster.

Question 545
A company hosts more than 300 global websites and applications. The company requires a platform to analyze more than 30 TB of clickstream data each day.
What should a solutions architect do to transmit and process the clickstream data?
A.
Design an AWS Data Pipeline to archive the data to an Amazon S3 bucket and run an Amazon EMR cluster with the data to generate analytics.
B.
Create an Auto Scaling group of Amazon EC2 instances to process the data and send it to an Amazon S3 data lake for Amazon Redshift to use for analysis.
C.
Cache the data to Amazon CloudFront. Store the data in an Amazon S3 bucket. When an object is added to the S3 bucket. run an AWS Lambda function to process the data for analysis.
D.
Collect the data from Amazon Kinesis Data Streams. Use Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose to transmit the data to an Amazon S3 data lake. Load the data in Amazon Redshift for analysis.

Answer: D

Explanation:
A. This option utilizes S3 for data storage and EMR for analytics, Data Pipeline is not ideal service for real-time streaming data ingestion and processing. It is better suited for batch processing scenarios.
B. This option involves managing and scaling EC2, which adds operational overhead. It is also not real-time streaming solution. Additionally, use of Redshift for analyzing clickstream data might not be most efficient or cost-effective approach.
C. CloudFront is CDN service and is not designed for real-time data processing or analytics. While using Lambda to process data can be an option, it may not be most efficient solution for processing large volumes of clickstream data.
Therefore, collecting the data from Kinesis Data Streams, using Kinesis Data Firehose to transmit it to S3 data lake, and loading it into Redshift for analysis is the recommended approach. This combination provides scalable, real-time streaming solution with storage and analytics capabilities that can handle high volume of clickstream data.

Question 546
A company migrated a MySQL database from the company's on-premises data center to an Amazon RDS for MySQL DB instance. The company sized the RDS DB instance to meet the company's average daily workload. Once a month, the database performs slowly when the company runs queries for a report. The company wants to have the ability to run reports and maintain the performance of the daily workloads.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Create a read replica of the database. Direct the queries to the read replica.
B.
Create a backup of the database. Restore the backup to another DB instance. Direct the queries to the new database.
C.
Export the data to Amazon S3. Use Amazon Athena to query the S3 bucket.
D.
Resize the DB instance to accommodate the additional workload.

Answer: A

Explanation:
This is the most cost-effective solution because it does not require any additional AWS services. A read replica is a copy of a database that is synchronized with the primary database. You can direct the queries for the report to the read replica, which will not affect the performance of the daily workloads

Question 548
A company uses AWS and sells access to copyrighted images. The company’s global customer base needs to be able to access these images quickly. The company must deny access to users from specific countries. The company wants to minimize costs as much as possible.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Use Amazon S3 to store the images. Turn on multi-factor authentication (MFA) and public bucket access. Provide customers with a link to the S3 bucket.
B.
Use Amazon S3 to store the images. Create an IAM user for each customer. Add the users to a group that has permission to access the S3 bucket.
C.
Use Amazon EC2 instances that are behind Application Load Balancers (ALBs) to store the images. Deploy the instances only in the countries the company services. Provide customers with links to the ALBs for their specific country's instances.
D.
Use Amazon S3 to store the images. Use Amazon CloudFront to distribute the images with geographic restrictions. Provide a signed URL for each customer to access the data in CloudFront.

Answer: D

Explanation:
Store images = Amazon S3
global customer base needs to be able to access these images quickly = Amazon CloudFront
deny access to users from specific countries = Amazon CloudFront geographic restrictions, signed URLs

Question 549
A solutions architect is designing a highly available Amazon ElastiCache for Redis based solution. The solutions architect needs to ensure that failures do not result in performance degradation or loss of data locally and within an AWS Region. The solution needs to provide high availability at the node level and at the Region level.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Use Multi-AZ Redis replication groups with shards that contain multiple nodes.
B.
Use Redis shards that contain multiple nodes with Redis append only files (AOF) turned on.
C.
Use a Multi-AZ Redis cluster with more than one read replica in the replication group.
D.
Use Redis shards that contain multiple nodes with Auto Scaling turned on.

Answer: A?C?

Explanation:
A
It seems like "Multi-AZ Redis replication group" (A) and "Multi-AZ Redis cluster" (C) are different wordings for the same configuration. However, "to minimize the impact of a node failure, we recommend that your implementation use multiple nodes in each shard" - and that is mentioned only in A.

C
In summary, option C, using a Multi-AZ Redis cluster with more than one read replica, is designed to provide both node-level and AWS Region-level high availability, making it the most suitable choice for the given requirements.

Question 550
A company plans to migrate to AWS and use Amazon EC2 On-Demand Instances for its application. During the migration testing phase, a technical team observes that the application takes a long time to launch and load memory to become fully productive.
Which solution will reduce the launch time of the application during the next testing phase?
A.
Launch two or more EC2 On-Demand Instances. Turn on auto scaling features and make the EC2 On-Demand Instances available during the next testing phase.
B.
Launch EC2 Spot Instances to support the application and to scale the application so it is available during the next testing phase.
C.
Launch the EC2 On-Demand Instances with hibernation turned on. Configure EC2 Auto Scaling warm pools during the next testing phase.
D.
Launch EC2 On-Demand Instances with Capacity Reservations. Start additional EC2 instances during the next testing phase.

Answer: C

Explanation:
Using EC2 hibernation and Auto Scaling warm pools will help address this:
Hibernation saves the in-memory state of the EC2 instance to persistent storage and shuts the instance down. When the instance is started again, the in-memory state is restored, which launches much faster than launching a new instance.
Warm pools pre-initialize EC2 instances and keep them ready to fulfill requests, reducing launch time. The hibernated instances can be added to a warm pool.
When auto scaling scales out during the next testing phase, it will be able to launch instances from the warm pool rapidly since they are already initialized

Question 551
A company's applications run on Amazon EC2 instances in Auto Scaling groups. The company notices that its applications experience sudden traffic increases on random days of the week. The company wants to maintain application performance during sudden traffic increases.
Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?
A.
Use manual scaling to change the size of the Auto Scaling group.
B.
Use predictive scaling to change the size of the Auto Scaling group.
C.
Use dynamic scaling to change the size of the Auto Scaling group.
D.
Use schedule scaling to change the size of the Auto Scaling group.

Answer: C

Explanation:
Dynamic Scaling – This is yet another type of Auto Scaling in which the number of EC2 instances is changed automatically depending on the signals received. Dynamic Scaling is a good choice when there is a high volume of unpredictable traffic.
https://www.developer.com/web-services/aws-auto-scaling-types-best-practices/#:~:text=Dynamic%20Scaling%20%E2%80%93%20This%20is%20yet,high%20volume%20of%20unpredictable%20traffic.

Question 552
An ecommerce application uses a PostgreSQL database that runs on an Amazon EC2 instance. During a monthly sales event, database usage increases and causes database connection issues for the application. The traffic is unpredictable for subsequent monthly sales events, which impacts the sales forecast. The company needs to maintain performance when there is an unpredictable increase in traffic.
Which solution resolves this issue in the MOST cost-effective way?
A.
Migrate the PostgreSQL database to Amazon Aurora Serverless v2.
B.
Enable auto scaling for the PostgreSQL database on the EC2 instance to accommodate increased usage.
C.
Migrate the PostgreSQL database to Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL with a larger instance type.
D.
Migrate the PostgreSQL database to Amazon Redshift to accommodate increased usage.

Answer: A

Explanation:
Aurora Serverless v2 got autoscaling, highly available and cheaper when compared to the other options.

Question 553
A company hosts an internal serverless application on AWS by using Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda. The company’s employees report issues with high latency when they begin using the application each day. The company wants to reduce latency.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Increase the API Gateway throttling limit.
B.
Set up a scheduled scaling to increase Lambda provisioned concurrency before employees begin to use the application each day.
C.
Create an Amazon CloudWatch alarm to initiate a Lambda function as a target for the alarm at the beginning of each day.
D.
Increase the Lambda function memory.

Answer: B

Explanation:
Provisioned concurrency ensures that a specified number of Lambda instances are initialized and ready to handle requests. By scheduling this scaling, you can pre-warm Lambda functions before peak usage times, reducing cold start latency. This solution directly addresses the latency issue caused by cold starts.

Question 554
A research company uses on-premises devices to generate data for analysis. The company wants to use the AWS Cloud to analyze the data. The devices generate .csv files and support writing the data to an SMB file share. Company analysts must be able to use SQL commands to query the data. The analysts will run queries periodically throughout the day.
Which combination of steps will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively? (Choose three.)
A.
Deploy an AWS Storage Gateway on premises in Amazon S3 File Gateway mode.
B.
Deploy an AWS Storage Gateway on premises in Amazon FSx File Gateway made.
C.
Set up an AWS Glue crawler to create a table based on the data that is in Amazon S3.
D.
Set up an Amazon EMR cluster with EMR File System (EMRFS) to query the data that is in Amazon S3. Provide access to analysts.
E.
Set up an Amazon Redshift cluster to query the data that is in Amazon S3. Provide access to analysts.
F.
Setup Amazon Athena to query the data that is in Amazon S3. Provide access to analysts.

Answer: ACF

Explanation:
A to upload the files to S3 via SMB
C to convert the data from CSV format
F to query with SQL
Not B (we need the data in S3, not in FSx)
Not D or E (we should provide the ability to run SQL queries)

With Outposts, you are responsible for providing resilient power and network connectivity to the Outpost racks to meet your availability requirements for workloads running on Outposts. You are responsible for the physical security and access controls of the data center environment. You must provide sufficient power, space, and cooling to keep the Outpost operational and network connections to connect the Outpost back to the Region. Since Outpost capacity is finite and determined by the size and number of racks AWS installs at your site, you must decide how much EC2, EBS, and S3 on Outposts capacity you need to run your initial workloads, accommodate future growth, and to provide extra capacity to mitigate server failures and maintenance events.

Question 556
A company uses NFS to store large video files in on-premises network attached storage. Each video file ranges in size from 1 MB to 500 GB. The total storage is 70 TB and is no longer growing. The company decides to migrate the video files to Amazon S3. The company must migrate the video files as soon as possible while using the least possible network bandwidth.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Create an S3 bucket. Create an IAM role that has permissions to write to the S3 bucket. Use the AWS CLI to copy all files locally to the S3 bucket.
B.
Create an AWS Snowball Edge job. Receive a Snowball Edge device on premises. Use the Snowball Edge client to transfer data to the device. Return the device so that AWS can import the data into Amazon S3.
C.
Deploy an S3 File Gateway on premises. Create a public service endpoint to connect to the S3 File Gateway. Create an S3 bucket. Create a new NFS file share on the S3 File Gateway. Point the new file share to the S3 bucket. Transfer the data from the existing NFS file share to the S3 File Gateway.
D.
Set up an AWS Direct Connect connection between the on-premises network and AWS. Deploy an S3 File Gateway on premises. Create a public virtual interface (VIF) to connect to the S3 File Gateway. Create an S3 bucket. Create a new NFS file share on the S3 File Gateway. Point the new file share to the S3 bucket. Transfer the data from the existing NFS file share to the S3 File Gateway.

Answer: B

Explanation:
B. On a Snowball Edge device you can copy files with a speed of up to 100Gbps. 70TB will take around 5600 seconds, so very quickly, less than 2 hours. The downside is that it'll take between 4-6 working days to receive the device and then another 2-3 working days to send it back and for AWS to move the data onto S3 once it reaches them. Total time: 6-9 working days. Bandwidth used: 0.
C. File Gateway uses the Internet, so maximum speed will be at most 1Gbps, so it'll take a minimum of 6.5 days and you use 70TB of Internet bandwidth.
D. You can achieve speeds of up to 10Gbps with Direct Connect. Total time 15.5 hours and you will use 70TB of bandwidth. However, what's interesting is that the question does not specific what type of bandwidth? Direct Connect does not use your Internet bandwidth, as you will have a dedicate peer to peer connectivity between your on-prem and the AWS Cloud, so technically, you're not using your "public" bandwidth. 
The requirements are a bit too vague but I think that B is the most appropriate answer, although D might also be correct if the bandwidth usage refers strictly to your public connectivity.

Question 557
A company has a website hosted on AWS. The website is behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB) that is configured to handle HTTP and HTTPS separately. The company wants to forward all requests to the website so that the requests will use HTTPS.
What should a solutions architect do to meet this requirement?
A.
Update the ALB's network ACL to accept only HTTPS traffic.
B.
Create a rule that replaces the HTTP in the URL with HTTPS.
C.
Create a listener rule on the ALB to redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS.
D.
Replace the ALB with a Network Load Balancer configured to use Server Name Indication (SNI).

Answer: C

Explanation:
A. Network ACLs operate at subnet level and control inbound and outbound traffic. Updating the network ACL alone will not enforce the redirection of HTTP to HTTPS.
B. This approach would require modifying application code or server configuration to perform URL rewrite. It is not an optimal solution as it adds complexity and potential maintenance overhead. Moreover, it does not leverage the ALB's capabilities for handling HTTP-to-HTTPS redirection.
D. While NLB can handle SSL/TLS termination using SNI for routing requests to different services, replacing the ALB solely to enforce HTTP-to-HTTPS redirection would be an unnecessary and more complex solution.
Therefore, the recommended approach is to create a listener rule on the ALB to redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS. By configuring a listener rule, you can define a redirect action that automatically directs HTTP requests to their corresponding HTTPS versions.

Question 558
A company is planning to migrate a TCP-based application into the company's VPC. The application is publicly accessible on a nonstandard TCP port through a hardware appliance in the company's data center. This public endpoint can process up to 3 million requests per second with low latency. The company requires the same level of performance for the new public endpoint in AWS.
What should a solutions architect recommend to meet this requirement?
A.
Deploy a Network Load Balancer (NLB). Configure the NLB to be publicly accessible over the TCP port that the application requires.
B.
Deploy an Application Load Balancer (ALB). Configure the ALB to be publicly accessible over the TCP port that the application requires.
C.
Deploy an Amazon CloudFront distribution that listens on the TCP port that the application requires. Use an Application Load Balancer as the origin.
D.
Deploy an Amazon API Gateway API that is configured with the TCP port that the application requires. Configure AWS Lambda functions with provisioned concurrency to process the requests.

Answer: A

Explanation:
Since the company requires the same level of performance for the new public endpoint in AWS.
A Network Load Balancer functions at the fourth layer of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model. It can handle millions of requests per second. After the load balancer receives a connection request, it selects a target from the target group for the default rule. It attempts to open a TCP connection to the selected target on the port specified in the listener configuration.

Question 559
A company runs its critical database on an Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance. The company wants to migrate to Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL with minimal downtime and data loss.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?
A.
Create a DB snapshot of the RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance to populate a new Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster.
B.
Create an Aurora read replica of the RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance. Promote the Aurora read replicate to a new Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster.
C.
Use data import from Amazon S3 to migrate the database to an Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster.
D.
Use the pg_dump utility to back up the RDS for PostgreSQL database. Restore the backup to a new Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster.

Answer: B

Explanation:
Aurora read replicas allow setting up replication from RDS PostgreSQL to Aurora PostgreSQL with minimal downtime.
Once replication is set up, the read replica can be promoted to a full standalone Aurora DB cluster with little to no downtime.
This approach leverages AWS's managed replication between the source RDS PostgreSQL instance and Aurora. It avoids having to manually create backups and restore data.
Using DB snapshots or pg_dump backups requires manually restoring data which increases downtime and operational overhead.
Data import from S3 would require exporting, uploading and then importing data which adds overhead.

Question 560
A company's infrastructure consists of hundreds of Amazon EC2 instances that use Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) storage. A solutions architect must ensure that every EC2 instance can be recovered after a disaster.
What should the solutions architect do to meet this requirement with the LEAST amount of effort?
A.
Take a snapshot of the EBS storage that is attached to each EC2 instance. Create an AWS CloudFormation template to launch new EC2 instances from the EBS storage.
B.
Take a snapshot of the EBS storage that is attached to each EC2 instance. Use AWS Elastic Beanstalk to set the environment based on the EC2 template and attach the EBS storage.
C.
Use AWS Backup to set up a backup plan for the entire group of EC2 instances. Use the AWS Backup API or the AWS CLI to speed up the restore process for multiple EC2 instances.
D.
Create an AWS Lambda function to take a snapshot of the EBS storage that is attached to each EC2 instance and copy the Amazon Machine Images (AMIs). Create another Lambda function to perform the restores with the copied AMIs and attach the EBS storage.

Answer: C

Explanation:
AWS Backup automates backup of resources like EBS volumes. It allows defining backup policies for groups of resources. This removes the need to manually create backups for each resource.
The AWS Backup API and CLI allow programmatic control of backup plans and restores. This enables restoring hundreds of EC2 instances programmatically after a disaster instead of manually.
AWS Backup handles cleanup of old backups based on policies to minimize storage costs.

Question 561
A company recently migrated to the AWS Cloud. The company wants a serverless solution for large-scale parallel on-demand processing of a semistructured dataset. The data consists of logs, media files, sales transactions, and IoT sensor data that is stored in Amazon S3. The company wants the solution to process thousands of items in the dataset in parallel.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the MOST operational efficiency?
A.
Use the AWS Step Functions Map state in Inline mode to process the data in parallel.
B.
Use the AWS Step Functions Map state in Distributed mode to process the data in parallel.
C.
Use AWS Glue to process the data in parallel.
D.
Use several AWS Lambda functions to process the data in parallel.

Answer: B

Explanation:
AWS Step Functions allows you to orchestrate and scale distributed processing using the Map state. The Map state can process items in a large dataset in parallel by distributing the work across multiple resources.
Using the Map state in Distributed mode will automatically handle the parallel processing and scaling. Step Functions will add more workers to process the data as needed.
Step Functions is serverless so there are no servers to manage. It will scale up and down automatically based on demand.

Question 562
A company will migrate 10 PB of data to Amazon S3 in 6 weeks. The current data center has a 500 Mbps uplink to the internet. Other on-premises applications share the uplink. The company can use 80% of the internet bandwidth for this one-time migration task.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Configure AWS DataSync to migrate the data to Amazon S3 and to automatically verify the data.
B.
Use rsync to transfer the data directly to Amazon S3.
C.
Use the AWS CLI and multiple copy processes to send the data directly to Amazon S3.
D.
Order multiple AWS Snowball devices. Copy the data to the devices. Send the devices to AWS to copy the data to Amazon S3.

Answer: D

Explanation:
1Gbps will roughly do 7 TB in 24 hours. This means 400Mbps will only do 3x42TB.

Question 563
A company has several on-premises Internet Small Computer Systems Interface (ISCSI) network storage servers. The company wants to reduce the number of these servers by moving to the AWS Cloud. A solutions architect must provide low-latency access to frequently used data and reduce the dependency on on-premises servers with a minimal number of infrastructure changes.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Deploy an Amazon S3 File Gateway.
B.
Deploy Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) storage with backups to Amazon S3.
C.
Deploy an AWS Storage Gateway volume gateway that is configured with stored volumes.
D.
Deploy an AWS Storage Gateway volume gateway that is configured with cached volumes.

Answer: D

Explanation:
The Storage Gateway volume gateway provides iSCSI block storage using cached volumes. This allows replacing the on-premises iSCSI servers with minimal changes.
Cached volumes store frequently accessed data locally for low latency access, while storing less frequently accessed data in S3.
This reduces the number of on-premises servers while still providing low latency access to hot data.
EBS does not provide iSCSI support to replace the existing servers.
S3 File Gateway is for file storage, not block storage.
Stored volumes would store all data on-premises, not in S3.

Question 564
A solutions architect is designing an application that will allow business users to upload objects to Amazon S3. The solution needs to maximize object durability. Objects also must be readily available at any time and for any length of time. Users will access objects frequently within the first 30 days after the objects are uploaded, but users are much less likely to access objects that are older than 30 days.
Which solution meets these requirements MOST cost-effectively?
A.
Store all the objects in S3 Standard with an S3 Lifecycle rule to transition the objects to S3 Glacier after 30 days.
B.
Store all the objects in S3 Standard with an S3 Lifecycle rule to transition the objects to S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) after 30 days.
C.
Store all the objects in S3 Standard with an S3 Lifecycle rule to transition the objects to S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA) after 30 days.
D.
Store all the objects in S3 Intelligent-Tiering with an S3 Lifecycle rule to transition the objects to S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) after 30 days.

Answer: B

Explanation:
Minimum Days for Transition to S3 Standard-IA or S3 One Zone-IA
Before you transition objects to S3 Standard-IA or S3 One Zone-IA, you must store them for at least 30 days in Amazon S3. For example, you cannot create a Lifecycle rule to transition objects to the S3 Standard-IA storage class one day after you create them. Amazon S3 doesn't support this transition within the first 30 days because newer objects are often accessed more frequently or deleted sooner than is suitable for S3 Standard-IA or S3 One Zone-IA storage.
Similarly, if you are transitioning noncurrent objects (in versioned buckets), you can transition only objects that are at least 30 days noncurrent to S3 Standard-IA or S3 One Zone-IA storage.

Question 565
A company has migrated a two-tier application from its on-premises data center to the AWS Cloud. The data tier is a Multi-AZ deployment of Amazon RDS for Oracle with 12 TB of General Purpose SSD Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) storage. The application is designed to process and store documents in the database as binary large objects (blobs) with an average document size of 6 MB.
The database size has grown over time, reducing the performance and increasing the cost of storage. The company must improve the database performance and needs a solution that is highly available and resilient.
Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?
A.
Reduce the RDS DB instance size. Increase the storage capacity to 24 TiB. Change the storage type to Magnetic.
B.
Increase the RDS DB instance size. Increase the storage capacity to 24 TiChange the storage type to Provisioned IOPS.
C.
Create an Amazon S3 bucket. Update the application to store documents in the S3 bucket. Store the object metadata in the existing database.
D.
Create an Amazon DynamoDB table. Update the application to use DynamoDB. Use AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) to migrate data from the Oracle database to DynamoDB.

Answer: C

Explanation:
When using BLOB, always try to pick a solution with S3.

Question 566
A company has an application that serves clients that are deployed in more than 20.000 retail storefront locations around the world. The application consists of backend web services that are exposed over HTTPS on port 443. The application is hosted on Amazon EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB). The retail locations communicate with the web application over the public internet. The company allows each retail location to register the IP address that the retail location has been allocated by its local ISP.
The company's security team recommends to increase the security of the application endpoint by restricting access to only the IP addresses registered by the retail locations.
What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements?
A.
Associate an AWS WAF web ACL with the ALB. Use IP rule sets on the ALB to filter traffic. Update the IP addresses in the rule to include the registered IP addresses.
B.
Deploy AWS Firewall Manager to manage the ALConfigure firewall rules to restrict traffic to the ALModify the firewall rules to include the registered IP addresses.
C.
Store the IP addresses in an Amazon DynamoDB table. Configure an AWS Lambda authorization function on the ALB to validate that incoming requests are from the registered IP addresses.
D.
Configure the network ACL on the subnet that contains the public interface of the ALB. Update the ingress rules on the network ACL with entries for each of the registered IP addresses.

Answer: A?C?

Explanation:
A
WAF, you can have 100 "rule sets" per account, each with up to 10,000 IP addresses.

Question 567
A company is building a data analysis platform on AWS by using AWS Lake Formation. The platform will ingest data from different sources such as Amazon S3 and Amazon RDS. The company needs a secure solution to prevent access to portions of the data that contain sensitive information.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?
A.
Create an IAM role that includes permissions to access Lake Formation tables.
B.
Create data filters to implement row-level security and cell-level security.
C.
Create an AWS Lambda function that removes sensitive information before Lake Formation ingests the data.
D.
Create an AWS Lambda function that periodically queries and removes sensitive information from Lake Formation tables.

Answer: B

Explanation:
Lake Formation data filters allow restricting access to rows or cells in data tables based on conditions. This allows preventing access to sensitive data.
Data filters are implemented within Lake Formation and do not require additional coding or Lambda functions.
Lambda functions to pre-process data or purge tables would require ongoing development and maintenance.
IAM roles only provide user-level permissions, not row or cell level security.
Data filters give granular access control over Lake Formation data with minimal configuration, avoiding complex custom code.

Question 568
A company is developing a two-tier web application on AWS. The company's developers have deployed the application on an Amazon EC2 instance that connects directly to a backend Amazon RDS database. The company must not hardcode database credentials in the application. The company must also implement a solution to automatically rotate the database credentials on a regular basis.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?
A.
Store the database credentials in the instance metadata. Use Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rules to run a scheduled AWS Lambda function that updates the RDS credentials and instance metadata at the same time.
B.
Store the database credentials in a configuration file in an encrypted Amazon S3 bucket. Use Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rules to run a scheduled AWS Lambda function that updates the RDS credentials and the credentials in the configuration file at the same time. Use S3 Versioning to ensure the ability to fall back to previous values.
C.
Store the database credentials as a secret in AWS Secrets Manager. Turn on automatic rotation for the secret. Attach the required permission to the EC2 role to grant access to the secret.
D.
Store the database credentials as encrypted parameters in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store. Turn on automatic rotation for the encrypted parameters. Attach the required permission to the EC2 role to grant access to the encrypted parameters.

Answer: C

Explanation:
Store the database credentials as a secret in AWS Secrets Manager. Turn on automatic rotation for the secret. Attach the required permission to the EC2 role to grant access to the secret.
AWS Secrets Manager is a service that enables you to easily rotate, manage, and retrieve database credentials, API keys, and other secrets throughout their lifecycle. By storing the database credentials as a secret in Secrets Manager, you can ensure that they are not hardcoded in the application and that they are automatically rotated on a regular basis. To grant the EC2 instance access to the secret, you can attach the required permission to the EC2 role. This will allow the application to retrieve the secret from Secrets Manager as needed.

Option A, storing the database credentials in the instance metadata and using a Lambda function to update them, would not meet the requirement of not hardcoding the credentials in the application. 
Option B, storing the database credentials in an encrypted S3 bucket and using a Lambda function to update them, would also not meet this requirement, as the application would still need to access the credentials from the configuration file. 
Option D, storing the database credentials as encrypted parameters in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store, would also not meet this requirement, as the application would still need to access the encrypted parameters in order to use them.

Question 569
A company deploys Amazon EC2 instances that run in a VPC. The EC2 instances load source data into Amazon S3 buckets so that the data can be processed in the future. According to compliance laws, the data must not be transmitted over the public internet. Servers in the company's on-premises data center will consume the output from an application that runs on the EC2 instances.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Deploy an interface VPC endpoint for Amazon EC2. Create an AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection between the company and the VPC.
B.
Deploy a gateway VPC endpoint for Amazon S3. Set up an AWS Direct Connect connection between the on-premises network and the VPC.
C.
Set up an AWS Transit Gateway connection from the VPC to the S3 buckets. Create an AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection between the company and the VPC.
D.
Set up proxy EC2 instances that have routes to NAT gateways. Configure the proxy EC2 instances to fetch S3 data and feed the application instances.

Answer: B

Explanation:
A gateway VPC endpoint for Amazon S3 allows the EC2 instances within the VPC to access Amazon S3 buckets without using the public internet. The traffic between the VPC and S3 is routed within the AWS network.
AWS Direct Connect establishes a private connection between the on-premises data center and AWS infrastructure, avoiding data transfer over the public internet and ensuring compliance with the specified requirements. It provides a dedicated network link with higher bandwidth options and potentially more consistent network performance than internet-based connections.
Whereas Option A uses Site-to-Site VPN connection which is secure. However it typically runs over the public internet, which would not meet the company's requirement of avoiding public internet data transit.

Question 570
A company has an application with a REST-based interface that allows data to be received in near-real time from a third-party vendor. Once received, the application processes and stores the data for further analysis. The application is running on Amazon EC2 instances.
The third-party vendor has received many 503 Service Unavailable Errors when sending data to the application. When the data volume spikes, the compute capacity reaches its maximum limit and the application is unable to process all requests.
Which design should a solutions architect recommend to provide a more scalable solution?
A.
Use Amazon Kinesis Data Streams to ingest the data. Process the data using AWS Lambda functions.
B.
Use Amazon API Gateway on top of the existing application. Create a usage plan with a quota limit for the third-party vendor.
C.
Use Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) to ingest the data. Put the EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group behind an Application Load Balancer.
D.
Repackage the application as a container. Deploy the application using Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) using the EC2 launch type with an Auto Scaling group.

Answer: A

Explanation:
Kinesis Data Streams provides an auto-scaling stream that can handle large amounts of streaming data ingestion and throughput. This removes the bottlenecks around receiving the data.
AWS Lambda can process and store the data in a scalable serverless manner, avoiding EC2 capacity limits.
API Gateway adds API management capabilities but does not improve the underlying scalability of the EC2 application.
SNS is for event publishing/notifications, not large scale data ingestion. ECS still relies on EC2 capacity.

Question 571
A company has an application that runs on Amazon EC2 instances in a private subnet. The application needs to process sensitive information from an Amazon S3 bucket. The application must not use the internet to connect to the S3 bucket.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Configure an internet gateway. Update the S3 bucket policy to allow access from the internet gateway. Update the application to use the new internet gateway.
B.
Configure a VPN connection. Update the S3 bucket policy to allow access from the VPN connection. Update the application to use the new VPN connection.
C.
Configure a NAT gateway. Update the S3 bucket policy to allow access from the NAT gateway. Update the application to use the new NAT gateway.
D.
Configure a VPC endpoint. Update the S3 bucket policy to allow access from the VPC endpoint. Update the application to use the new VPC endpoint.

Answer: D

Explanation:
The solution that will meet these requirements is to:
Configure a VPC endpoint for Amazon S3
Update the S3 bucket policy to allow access from the VPC endpoint
Update the application to use the new VPC endpoint
The key reasons are:
VPC endpoints allow private connectivity from VPCs to AWS services like S3 without using an internet gateway.
The application can connect to S3 through the VPC endpoint while remaining in the private subnet, without internet access.

Question 572
A company uses Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) to run a container application. The EKS cluster stores sensitive information in the Kubernetes secrets object. The company wants to ensure that the information is encrypted.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?
A.
Use the container application to encrypt the information by using AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS).
B.
Enable secrets encryption in the EKS cluster by using AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS).
C.
Implement an AWS Lambda function to encrypt the information by using AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS).
D.
Use AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store to encrypt the information by using AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS).

Answer: B

Explanation:
EKS supports encrypting Kubernetes secrets at the cluster level using AWS KMS keys. This provides an automated way to encrypt secrets.
Enabling this feature requires minimal configuration changes to the EKS cluster and no code changes.
Other options like using Lambda functions or modifying the application code to encrypt secrets require additional development effort and overhead.
Systems Manager Parameter Store could store encrypted parameters but does not natively integrate with EKS to encrypt Kubernetes secrets.
The EKS secrets encryption feature leverages AWS KMS without the need to directly call KMS APIs from the application.

Question 573
A company is designing a new multi-tier web application that consists of the following components:
• Web and application servers that run on Amazon EC2 instances as part of Auto Scaling groups
• An Amazon RDS DB instance for data storage
A solutions architect needs to limit access to the application servers so that only the web servers can access them.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Deploy AWS PrivateLink in front of the application servers. Configure the network ACL to allow only the web servers to access the application servers.
B.
Deploy a VPC endpoint in front of the application servers. Configure the security group to allow only the web servers to access the application servers.
C.
Deploy a Network Load Balancer with a target group that contains the application servers' Auto Scaling group. Configure the network ACL to allow only the web servers to access the application servers.
D.
Deploy an Application Load Balancer with a target group that contains the application servers' Auto Scaling group. Configure the security group to allow only the web servers to access the application servers.

Answer: D

Explanation:
An Application Load Balancer (ALB) allows directing traffic to the application servers and provides access control via security groups.
Security groups act as a firewall at the instance level and can control access to the application servers from the web servers.
Network ACLs work at the subnet level and are less flexible for security groups for instance-level access control.
VPC endpoints are used to provide private access to AWS services, not for access between EC2 instances.
AWS PrivateLink provides private connectivity between VPCs, which is not required in this single VPC scenario.

Question 574
A company runs a critical, customer-facing application on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS). The application has a microservices architecture. The company needs to implement a solution that collects, aggregates, and summarizes metrics and logs from the application in a centralized location.
Which solution meets these requirements?
A.
Run the Amazon CloudWatch agent in the existing EKS cluster. View the metrics and logs in the CloudWatch console.
B.
Run AWS App Mesh in the existing EKS cluster. View the metrics and logs in the App Mesh console.
C.
Configure AWS CloudTrail to capture data events. Query CloudTrail by using Amazon OpenSearch Service.
D.
Configure Amazon CloudWatch Container Insights in the existing EKS cluster. View the metrics and logs in the CloudWatch console.

Answer: D

Explanation:
Use CloudWatch Container Insights to collect, aggregate, and summarize metrics and logs from your containerized applications and microservices. Container Insights is available for Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS), Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS), and Kubernetes platforms on Amazon EC2. Container Insights supports collecting metrics from clusters deployed on AWS Fargate for both Amazon ECS and Amazon EKS.
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/ContainerInsights.html

Question 575
A company has deployed its newest product on AWS. The product runs in an Auto Scaling group behind a Network Load Balancer. The company stores the product’s objects in an Amazon S3 bucket.
The company recently experienced malicious attacks against its systems. The company needs a solution that continuously monitors for malicious activity in the AWS account, workloads, and access patterns to the S3 bucket. The solution must also report suspicious activity and display the information on a dashboard.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Configure Amazon Macie to monitor and report findings to AWS Config.
B.
Configure Amazon Inspector to monitor and report findings to AWS CloudTrail.
C.
Configure Amazon GuardDuty to monitor and report findings to AWS Security Hub.
D.
Configure AWS Config to monitor and report findings to Amazon EventBridge.

Answer: C

Explanation:
Amazon GuardDuty is a threat detection service that continuously monitors for malicious activity and unauthorized behavior. It analyzes AWS CloudTrail, VPC Flow Logs, and DNS logs.
GuardDuty can detect threats like instance or S3 bucket compromise, malicious IP addresses, or unusual API calls.
Findings can be sent to AWS Security Hub which provides a centralized security dashboard and alerts.
Amazon Macie and Amazon Inspector do not monitor the breadth of activity that GuardDuty does. They focus more on data security and application vulnerabilities respectively.
AWS Config monitors for resource configuration changes, not malicious activity.

Question 576
A company wants to migrate an on-premises data center to AWS. The data center hosts a storage server that stores data in an NFS-based file system. The storage server holds 200 GB of data. The company needs to migrate the data without interruption to existing services. Multiple resources in AWS must be able to access the data by using the NFS protocol.
Which combination of steps will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively? (Choose two.)
A.
Create an Amazon FSx for Lustre file system.
B.
Create an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file system.
C.
Create an Amazon S3 bucket to receive the data.
D.
Manually use an operating system copy command to push the data into the AWS destination.
E.
Install an AWS DataSync agent in the on-premises data center. Use a DataSync task between the on-premises location and AWS.

Answer: BE

Explanation:
Amazon EFS provides a scalable, high performance NFS file system that can be accessed from multiple resources in AWS.
AWS DataSync can perform the migration from the on-prem NFS server to EFS without interruption to existing services.
This avoids having to manually move the data which could cause downtime. DataSync incrementally syncs changed data.
EFS and DataSync together provide a cost-optimized approach compared to using S3 or FSx, while still meeting the requirements.
Manually copying 200 GB of data to AWS would be slow and risky compared to using DataSync.

Question 577
A company wants to use Amazon FSx for Windows File Server for its Amazon EC2 instances that have an SMB file share mounted as a volume in the us-east-1 Region. The company has a recovery point objective (RPO) of 5 minutes for planned system maintenance or unplanned service disruptions. The company needs to replicate the file system to the us-west-2 Region. The replicated data must not be deleted by any user for 5 years.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Create an FSx for Windows File Server file system in us-east-1 that has a Single-AZ 2 deployment type. Use AWS Backup to create a daily backup plan that includes a backup rule that copies the backup to us-west-2. Configure AWS Backup Vault Lock in compliance mode for a target vault in us-west-2. Configure a minimum duration of 5 years.
B.
Create an FSx for Windows File Server file system in us-east-1 that has a Multi-AZ deployment type.

Use AWS Backup to create a daily backup plan that includes a backup rule that copies the backup to us-west-2. Configure AWS Backup Vault Lock in governance mode for a target vault in us-west-2. Configure a minimum duration of 5 years.

Answer: C

Explanation:
high availability = multi AZ
data must be retained for 5 years = compliance mode

Question 578
A solutions architect is designing a security solution for a company that wants to provide developers with individual AWS accounts through AWS Organizations, while also maintaining standard security controls. Because the individual developers will have AWS account root user-level access to their own accounts, the solutions architect wants to ensure that the mandatory AWS CloudTrail configuration that is applied to new developer accounts is not modified.
Which action meets these requirements?
A.
Create an IAM policy that prohibits changes to CloudTrail. and attach it to the root user.
B.
Create a new trail in CloudTrail from within the developer accounts with the organization trails option enabled.
C.
Create a service control policy (SCP) that prohibits changes to CloudTrail, and attach it the developer accounts.
D.
Create a service-linked role for CloudTrail with a policy condition that allows changes only from an Amazon Resource Name (ARN) in the management account.

Answer: C

Explanation:
For Organizations to restrict users in accounts, use an SCP.

Question 579
A company is deploying a new public web application to AWS. The application will run behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB). The application needs to be encrypted at the edge with an SSL/TLS certificate that is issued by an external certificate authority (CA). The certificate must be rotated each year before the certificate expires.
What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements?
A.
Use AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) to issue an SSL/TLS certificate. Apply the certificate to the ALB. Use the managed renewal feature to automatically rotate the certificate.
B.
Use AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) to issue an SSL/TLS certificate. Import the key material from the certificate. Apply the certificate to the ALUse the managed renewal feature to automatically rotate the certificate.
C.
Use AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) Private Certificate Authority to issue an SSL/TLS certificate from the root CA. Apply the certificate to the ALB. Use the managed renewal feature to automatically rotate the certificate.
D.
Use AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) to import an SSL/TLS certificate. Apply the certificate to the ALB. Use Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) to send a notification when the certificate is nearing expiration. Rotate the certificate manually.

Answer: D

Explanation:
D: With this approach, you import the third-party certificate into ACM, which allows you to centrally manage and apply it to the ALB. By configuring CloudWatch Events, you can receive notifications when the certificate is close to expiring, prompting you to manually initiate the rotation process.
A & B: These options assume that the SSL/TLS certificate can be issued directly by ACM. However, since the requirement specifies that the certificate should be issued by an external certificate authority (CA), this option is not suitable.
C: ACM Private Certificate Authority is used when you want to create your own private CA and issue certificates from it. It does not support certificates issued by external CAs. Therefore, this option is not suitable for the given requirement.

Question 580
A company is planning to deploy a business-critical application in the AWS Cloud. The application requires durable storage with consistent, low-latency performance.
Which type of storage should a solutions architect recommend to meet these requirements?
A.
Instance store volume
B.
Amazon ElastiCache for Memcached cluster
C.
Provisioned IOPS SSD Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume
D.
Throughput Optimized HDD Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume

Answer: C

Explanation:
Provisioned IOPS SSD — Provides high performance for mission-critical, low-latency, or high-throughput workloads. Throughput Optimized HDD — A low-cost HDD designed for frequently accessed, throughput-intensive workloads.

Question 581
An online photo-sharing company stores its photos in an Amazon S3 bucket that exists in the us-west-1 Region. The company needs to store a copy of all new photos in the us-east-1 Region.
Which solution will meet this requirement with the LEAST operational effort?
A.
Create a second S3 bucket in us-east-1. Use S3 Cross-Region Replication to copy photos from the existing S3 bucket to the second S3 bucket.
B.
Create a cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) configuration of the existing S3 bucket. Specify us-east-1 in the CORS rule's AllowedOrigin element.
C.
Create a second S3 bucket in us-east-1 across multiple Availability Zones. Create an S3 Lifecycle rule to save photos into the second S3 bucket.
D.
Create a second S3 bucket in us-east-1. Configure S3 event notifications on object creation and update events to invoke an AWS Lambda function to copy photos from the existing S3 bucket to the second S3 bucket.

Answer: A

Explanation:
S3 Cross-Region Replication handles automatically copying new objects added to the source bucket to the destination bucket in a different region.
It continuously replicates new photos without needing to manually copy files or set up Lambda triggers.
CORS only enables cross-origin access, it does not copy objects.
Using Lifecycle rules or Lambda functions requires custom code and logic to handle the copying.
S3 Cross-Region Replication provides automated replication that minimizes operational overhead.

Question 582
A company is creating a new web application for its subscribers. The application will consist of a static single page and a persistent database layer. The application will have millions of users for 4 hours in the morning, but the application will have only a few thousand users during the rest of the day. The company's data architects have requested the ability to rapidly evolve their schema.
Which solutions will meet these requirements and provide the MOST scalability? (Choose two.)
A.
Deploy Amazon DynamoDB as the database solution. Provision on-demand capacity.
B.
Deploy Amazon Aurora as the database solution. Choose the serverless DB engine mode.
C.
Deploy Amazon DynamoDB as the database solution. Ensure that DynamoDB auto scaling is enabled.
D.
Deploy the static content into an Amazon S3 bucket. Provision an Amazon CloudFront distribution with the S3 bucket as the origin.
E.
Deploy the web servers for static content across a fleet of Amazon EC2 instances in Auto Scaling groups. Configure the instances to periodically refresh the content from an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) volume.

Answer: AD?CD?

Explanation:
AD
Question asks for "most scalability", not cost optimization. "DynamoDB auto scaling ... modifies provisioned throughput settings only when the actual workload stays elevated or depressed for a sustained period of several minutes. ... This means that provisioned capacity is probably best for you if you have relatively predictable application traffic, run applications whose traffic is consistent, and ramps up or down gradually."

CD
DynamoDB auto scaling allows the database to scale up and down dynamically based on traffic patterns. This handles the large spike in traffic in the mornings and lower traffic later in the day.
S3 combined with CloudFront provides a highly scalable infrastructure for the static content. CloudFront caching improves performance.
Aurora serverless could be an option but may not scale as seamlessly as DynamoDB to the very high spike in users.
EC2 Auto Scaling groups add complexity compared to S3/CloudFront for static content hosting.

Question 583
A company uses Amazon API Gateway to manage its REST APIs that third-party service providers access. The company must protect the REST APIs from SQL injection and cross-site scripting attacks.
What is the MOST operationally efficient solution that meets these requirements?
A.
Configure AWS Shield.
B.
Configure AWS WAF.
C.
Set up API Gateway with an Amazon CloudFront distribution. Configure AWS Shield in CloudFront.
D.
Set up API Gateway with an Amazon CloudFront distribution. Configure AWS WAF in CloudFront.

Answer: B

Explanation:
Question asks for protection against SQL injection and XSS, both is provided by WAF (option B). D would work too, but it would add another layer (CloudFront) with benefits that nobody asked for (and that would cost money), thus it would IMO be less 'operationally efficient'.

Question 584
A company wants to provide users with access to AWS resources. The company has 1,500 users and manages their access to on-premises resources through Active Directory user groups on the corporate network. However, the company does not want users to have to maintain another identity to access the resources. A solutions architect must manage user access to the AWS resources while preserving access to the on-premises resources.
What should the solutions architect do to meet these requirements?
A.
Create an IAM user for each user in the company. Attach the appropriate policies to each user.
B.
Use Amazon Cognito with an Active Directory user pool. Create roles with the appropriate policies attached.
C.
Define cross-account roles with the appropriate policies attached. Map the roles to the Active Directory groups.
D.
Configure Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2 0-based federation. Create roles with the appropriate policies attached Map the roles to the Active Directory groups.

Answer: D

Explanation:
While Amazon Cognito can integrate with Active Directory, it is more focused on providing identity management for mobile and web applications. In this scenario, where the primary concern is integrating with existing on-premises resources, using SAML-based federation with IAM roles is more appropriate.

Question 585
A company is hosting a website behind multiple Application Load Balancers. The company has different distribution rights for its content around the world. A solutions architect needs to ensure that users are served the correct content without violating distribution rights.
Which configuration should the solutions architect choose to meet these requirements?
A.
Configure Amazon CloudFront with AWS WAF.
B.
Configure Application Load Balancers with AWS WAF
C.
Configure Amazon Route 53 with a geolocation policy
D.
Configure Amazon Route 53 with a geoproximity routing policy

Answer: C

Explanation:
When you use geolocation routing, you can localize your content and present some or all of your website in the language of your users. You can also use geolocation routing to restrict distribution of content to only the locations in which you have distribution rights. Another possible use is for balancing load across endpoints in a predictable, easy-to-manage way, so that each user location is consistently routed to the same endpoint.

Question 586
A company stores its data on premises. The amount of data is growing beyond the company's available capacity.
The company wants to migrate its data from the on-premises location to an Amazon S3 bucket. The company needs a solution that will automatically validate the integrity of the data after the transfer.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.

Question 587
A company wants to migrate two DNS servers to AWS. The servers host a total of approximately 200 zones and receive 1 million requests each day on average. The company wants to maximize availability while minimizing the operational overhead that is related to the management of the two servers.
What should a solutions architect recommend to meet these requirements?
A.
Create 200 new hosted zones in the Amazon Route 53 console Import zone files.
B.
Launch a single large Amazon EC2 instance Import zone tiles. Configure Amazon CloudWatch alarms and notifications to alert the company about any downtime.
C.
Migrate the servers to AWS by using AWS Server Migration Service (AWS SMS). Configure Amazon CloudWatch alarms and notifications to alert the company about any downtime.
D.
Launch an Amazon EC2 instance in an Auto Scaling group across two Availability Zones. Import zone files. Set the desired capacity to 1 and the maximum capacity to 3 for the Auto Scaling group. Configure scaling alarms to scale based on CPU utilization.

Answer: A

Explanation:
Key requirement it "maximize availability while minimizing the operational overhead" of 200 zones to process million requests
R53 is designed exactly to do this and supports zone import functionality so literally does the job of their EC2 servers but much better so BCD become "overhead" by default. I doubt D will work.

Question 590
A company runs its infrastructure on AWS and has a registered base of 700,000 users for its document management application. The company intends to create a product that converts large .pdf files to .jpg image files. The .pdf files average 5 MB in size. The company needs to store the original files and the converted files. A solutions architect must design a scalable solution to accommodate demand that will grow rapidly over time.
Which solution meets these requirements MOST cost-effectively?
A.
Save the .pdf files to Amazon S3. Configure an S3 PUT event to invoke an AWS Lambda function to convert the files to .jpg format and store them back in Amazon S3.
B.
Save the .pdf files to Amazon DynamoDUse the DynamoDB Streams feature to invoke an AWS Lambda function to convert the files to .jpg format and store them back in DynamoDB.
C.
Upload the .pdf files to an AWS Elastic Beanstalk application that includes Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) storage, and an Auto Scaling group. Use a program in the EC2 instances to convert the files to .jpg format. Save the .pdf files and the .jpg files in the EBS store.
D.
Upload the .pdf files to an AWS Elastic Beanstalk application that includes Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) storage, and an Auto Scaling group. Use a program in the EC2 instances to convert the file to .jpg format. Save the .pdf files and the .jpg files in the EBS store.

Answer: A

Explanation:
B. Using DynamoDB for storing and processing large .pdf files would not be cost-effective due to storage and throughput costs associated with DynamoDB.
C. Using Elastic Beanstalk with EC2 and EBS storage can work, but it may not be most cost-effective solution. It involves managing the underlying infrastructure and scaling manually.
D. Similar to C, using Elastic Beanstalk with EC2 and EFS storage can work, but it may not be most cost-effective solution. EFS is a shared file storage service and may not provide optimal performance for conversion process, especially as demand and file sizes increase.
A. leverages Lambda and the scalable and cost-effective storage of S3. With Lambda, you only pay for actual compute time used during the file conversion, and S3 provides durable and scalable storage for both .pdf files and .jpg files. The S3 PUT event triggers Lambda to perform conversion, eliminating need to manage infrastructure and scaling, making it most cost-effective solution for this scenario.

Question 591
A solutions architect is creating a data processing job that runs once daily and can take up to 2 hours to complete. If the job is interrupted, it has to restart from the beginning.

D.
Store the data in an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) Provisioned IOPS volume shared between the application instances.

Answer: C

Explanation:
Shared File System: Amazon EFS allows multiple Amazon EC2 instances to mount the same file system simultaneously, making it easy for multiple instances to access and modify the data concurrently.

Question 594
A company manages an application that stores data on an Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL Multi-AZ DB instance. Increases in traffic are causing performance problems. The company determines that database queries are the primary reason for the slow performance.
What should a solutions architect do to improve the application's performance?
A.
Serve read traffic from the Multi-AZ standby replica.
B.
Configure the DB instance to use Transfer Acceleration.
C.
Create a read replica from the source DB instance. Serve read traffic from the read replica.
D.
Use Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose between the application and Amazon RDS to increase the concurrency of database requests.

Answer: C

Explanation:
A Multi-AZ DB instance Creates a primary DB instance with one standby DB instance in a different Availability Zone. Using a Multi-AZ DB instance provides high availability, but the standby DB instance doesn't support connections for read workloads.
Therefore you will need to create a read replica from the source DB instance then serve read traffic from the read replica.

Question 595
A company collects 10 GB of telemetry data daily from various machines. The company stores the data in an Amazon S3 bucket in a source data account.
The company has hired several consulting agencies to use this data for analysis. Each agency needs read access to the data for its analysts. The company must share the data from the source data account by choosing a solution that maximizes security and operational efficiency.

A.
Configure S3 global tables to replicate data for each agency.
B.
Make the S3 bucket public for a limited time. Inform only the agencies.
C.
Configure cross-account access for the S3 bucket to the accounts that the agencies own.
D.
Set up an IAM user for each analyst in the source data account. Grant each user access to the S3 bucket.

Answer: C

Explanation:
With cross-account bucket permissions Account A—can grant another AWS account, Account B, permission to access its resources such as buckets and objects. Account B can then delegate those permissions to users in its account.
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/example-walkthroughs-managing-access-example2.html#:~:text=4%3A%20Clean%20up-,An%20AWS%20account,-%E2%80%94for%20example%2C%20Account

Question 596
A company uses Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP in its primary AWS Region for CIFS and NFS file shares. Applications that run on Amazon EC2 instances access the file shares. The company needs a storage disaster recovery (DR) solution in a secondary Region. The data that is replicated in the secondary Region needs to be accessed by using the same protocols as the primary Region.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?
A.
Create an AWS Lambda function to copy the data to an Amazon S3 bucket. Replicate the S3 bucket to the secondary Region.
B.
Create a backup of the FSx for ONTAP volumes by using AWS Backup. Copy the volumes to the secondary Region. Create a new FSx for ONTAP instance from the backup.
C.
Create an FSx for ONTAP instance in the secondary Region. Use NetApp SnapMirror to replicate data from the primary Region to the secondary Region.
D.
Create an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) volume. Migrate the current data to the volume. Replicate the volume to the secondary Region.

Answer: C

Explanation:
This is a very rare usage scenario so here are the docs related to the product:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/ONTAPGuide/scheduled-replication.html
AD: Not compatible solutions
B: Either wrongly worded or missing something but if I read it correctly, it means just take a backup and restore whereas the question is about continuous replication. If B was scheduled then it would have made sense
C is correct as SnapMirror is a managed solution to replicate the data

Question 597
A development team is creating an event-based application that uses AWS Lambda functions. Events will be generated when files are added to an Amazon S3 bucket. The development team currently has Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) configured as the event target from Amazon S3.
What should a solutions architect do to process the events from Amazon S3 in a scalable way?
A.
Create an SNS subscription that processes the event in Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) before the event runs in Lambda.
B.
Create an SNS subscription that processes the event in Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) before the event runs in Lambda
C.
Create an SNS subscription that sends the event to Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS). Configure the SOS queue to trigger a Lambda function.
D.
Create an SNS subscription that sends the event to AWS Server Migration Service (AWS SMS). Configure the Lambda function to poll from the SMS event.

Answer: C

Explanation:
Amazon SQS is designed for event-driven and scalable message processing. It can handle large volumes of messages and automatically scales based on the incoming workload. This allows for better load distribution and scaling as compared to direct Lambda invocation.

Question 598
A solutions architect is designing a new service behind Amazon API Gateway. The request patterns for the service will be unpredictable and can change suddenly from 0 requests to over 500 per second. The total size of the data that needs to be persisted in a backend database is currently less than 1 GB with unpredictable future growth. Data can be queried using simple key-value requests.
Which combination ofAWS services would meet these requirements? (Choose two.)
A.
AWS Fargate
B.
AWS Lambda
C.
Amazon DynamoDB
D.
Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling
E.
MySQL-compatible Amazon Aurora

Answer: BC

Explanation:
Unpredictable scaling of API load = Lambda + SPI Gateway
Unpredictable growth of key/value DB = DynamoDB
Fargate behind API requires EKS/ECS setup which is not suitable for 0-500 varying load. Same with EC2 autoscaling.
Aurora MySQL is not ideal for key/value and is better suited for relational databases

Question 599
A company collects and shares research data with the company's employees all over the world. The company wants to collect and store the data in an Amazon S3 bucket and process the data in the AWS Cloud. The company will share the data with the company's employees. The company needs a secure solution in the AWS Cloud that minimizes operational overhead.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Use an AWS Lambda function to create an S3 presigned URL. Instruct employees to use the URL.
B.
Create an IAM user for each employee. Create an IAM policy for each employee to allow S3 access. Instruct employees to use the AWS Management Console.
C.
Create an S3 File Gateway. Create a share for uploading and a share for downloading. Allow employees to mount shares on their local computers to use S3 File Gateway.
D.
Configure AWS Transfer Family SFTP endpoints. Select the custom identity provider options. Use AWS Secrets Manager to manage the user credentials Instruct employees to use Transfer Family.

Answer: A?C?D?

Explanation:
A
This solution meets the requirements by providing a secure way for employees to access the data stored in the Amazon S3 bucket. Here's how it works:
When an employee needs to access the data, they request access from the company's system.
The company's system triggers an AWS Lambda function.
The Lambda function generates a presigned URL with a limited validity period.
The employee uses the presigned URL to access the data directly from the S3 bucket.
Once the presigned URL expires, access to the data is no longer possible, enhancing security.
This solution minimizes operational overhead because it leverages AWS Lambda, which is a fully managed service. There is no need to manage servers or infrastructure, and the solution provides a secure and temporary access mechanism for sharing data stored in Amazon S3.

C
Not A - S3 presigned URLs are temporary (max. 7 days); you'd need to create a new URL at least every 7 days and "instruct employees" to use it. Definitely NOT 'minimizing operational overhead'.
Not B - "Instruct employees to use the AWS Management Console", using Management console to up- and download files is complex
Not D - Secrets Manager is not for managing user credentials, and employees would not "use Transfer Family", they would use an (S)FTP client to access the files.
C grants simple access for up/downloading, no operational overhead.

D
AWS Transfer Family (Option D)
By configuring AWS Transfer Family SFTP endpoints, you can provide a secure and convenient way for employees to access and transfer data to and from the S3 bucket.
Using custom identity provider options allows you to integrate with existing identity systems, and AWS Secrets Manager can be used to manage user credentials securely.
A suggests using an AWS Lambda function to create an S3 presigned URL. While this can work, it involves manual generation of URLs and sharing them, which may not be as scalable or user-friendly.
B suggests creating an IAM user for each employee with IAM policies for S3 access. This involves more operational overhead, as managing IAM users for each employee can be cumbersome and less scalable.
C suggests using an S3 File Gateway. While this can work, it introduces additional components and may not be as straightforward or as efficient as using AWS Transfer Family for SFTP access.

Question 600
A company is building a new furniture inventory application. The company has deployed the application on a fleet ofAmazon EC2 instances across multiple Availability Zones. The EC2 instances run behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB) in their VPC.
A solutions architect has observed that incoming traffic seems to favor one EC2 instance, resulting in latency for some requests.
What should the solutions architect do to resolve this issue?
A.
Disable session affinity (sticky sessions) on the ALB
B.
Replace the ALB with a Network Load Balancer
C.
Increase the number of EC2 instances in each Availability Zone
D.
Adjust the frequency of the health checks on the ALB's target group

Answer: A

Explanation:
Session affinity is a feature of the Application Load Balancer that keeps client requests on the same EC2 instance for the duration of the session. This can cause latency issues if one EC2 instance is overloaded while others are not, as the overloaded instance will handle all subsequent requests until it is taken offline.
To resolve this issue, the solutions architect should disable session affinity on the ALB. This can be done by setting the "Session affinity" parameter to "Off" in the ALB's configuration.
Disabling session affinity will cause the ALB to distribute requests across all EC2 instances in the target group, rather than keeping them on a single instance. This will help to balance the load and reduce latency for all requests.

Question 601
A company has more than 5 TB of file data on Windows file servers that run on premises. Users and applications interact with the data each day.
The company is moving its Windows workloads to AWS. As the company continues this process, the company requires access to AWS and on-premises file storage with minimum latency. The company needs a solution that minimizes operational overhead and requires no significant changes to the existing file access patterns. The company uses an AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection for connectivity to AWS.
What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements?
A.
Deploy and configure Amazon FSx for Windows File Server on AWS. Move the on-premises file data to FSx for Windows File Server. Reconfigure the workloads to use FSx for Windows File Server on AWS.
B.
Deploy and configure an Amazon S3 File Gateway on premises. Move the on-premises file data to the S3 File Gateway. Reconfigure the on-premises workloads and the cloud workloads to use the S3 File Gateway.
C.
Deploy and configure an Amazon S3 File Gateway on premises. Move the on-premises file data to Amazon S3. Reconfigure the workloads to use either Amazon S3 directly or the S3 File Gateway. depending on each workload's location.
D.
Deploy and configure Amazon FSx for Windows File Server on AWS. Deploy and configure an Amazon FSx File Gateway on premises. Move the on-premises file data to the FSx File Gateway. Configure the cloud workloads to use FSx for Windows File Server on AWS. Configure the on-premises workloads to use the FSx File Gateway.

Answer: A?D?

Explanation:
A
Option D suggests deploying both Amazon FSx for Windows File Server on AWS and an Amazon FSx File Gateway on premises. While this option may provide a solution for accessing on-premises file data in AWS, it introduces additional complexity and potential overhead that may not be necessary given the company's existing AWS Site-to-Site VPN connectivity.
Here are some reasons why Option D may not be the most suitable choice:
Complexity, Cost, Redundancy and Operational Overhead.

D
Amazon FSx File Gateway (FSx File Gateway) is a new File Gateway type that provides low latency and efficient access to in-cloud FSx for Windows File Server file shares from your on-premises facility. If you maintain on-premises file storage because of latency or bandwidth requirements, you can instead use FSx File Gateway for seamless access to fully managed, highly reliable, and virtually unlimited Windows file shares provided in the AWS Cloud by FSx for Windows File Server.
FSx File Gateway provides the following benefits:
1. Helps eliminate on-premises file servers and consolidates all their data in AWS to take advantage of the scale and economics of cloud storage.
2. Provides options that you can use for all your file workloads, including those that require on-premises access to cloud data.
3. Applications that need to stay on premises can now experience the same low latency and high performance that they have in AWS, without taxing your networks or impacting the latencies experienced by your most demanding applications.

Question 602
A company has an application workflow that uses an AWS Lambda function to download and decrypt files from Amazon S3. These files are encrypted using AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) keys. A solutions architect needs to design a solution that will ensure the required permissions are set correctly.
Which combination of actions accomplish this? (Choose two.)
A.
Attach the kms:decrypt permission to the Lambda function’s resource policy
B.
Grant the decrypt permission for the Lambda IAM role in the KMS key's policy
C.
Grant the decrypt permission for the Lambda resource policy in the KMS key's policy.
D.
Create a new IAM policy with the kms:decrypt permission and attach the policy to the Lambda function.
E.
Create a new IAM role with the kms:decrypt permission and attach the execution role to the Lambda function.

Answer: BD?BE?

Explanation:
BD
The combination of Option B (Grant the decrypt permission for the Lambda IAM role in the KMS key's policy) and Option D (Create a new IAM policy with the kms
permission and attach the policy to the Lambda function) ensures that both the IAM role used by the Lambda function and the KMS key policy are correctly configured to allow decryption of the files. This setup meets the security requirements and ensures the Lambda function can perform its tasks without issues.

BE
The key policy has to be modified to give lambda execution role access. You can't set another resource policy as principle. So C is not right

AC are resource policy, i.e. who can use lambda.
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/access-control-resource-based.html
D: The wording is confusing so it sort of sounds as if it is correct but you cannot attach a policy to a function.

Question 603

B.
Enable Cost and Usage Reports in the management account. Deliver the reports to Amazon S3 Use Amazon Athena for analysis.
C.
Enable Cost and Usage Reports for member accounts. Deliver the reports to Amazon S3 Use Amazon Redshift for analysis.
D.
Enable Cost and Usage Reports for member accounts. Deliver the reports to Amazon Kinesis. Use Amazon QuickSight tor analysis.

Answer: B

Explanation:
Scalable and cost-effective way = Enable Cost and Usage Reports in the management account. Deliver the reports to Amazon S3 Use Amazon Athena for analysis

Question 604
A company wants to run a gaming application on Amazon EC2 instances that are part of an Auto Scaling group in the AWS Cloud. The application will transmit data by using UDP packets. The company wants to ensure that the application can scale out and in as traffic increases and decreases.
What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements?
A.
Attach a Network Load Balancer to the Auto Scaling group.
B.
Attach an Application Load Balancer to the Auto Scaling group.
C.
Deploy an Amazon Route 53 record set with a weighted policy to route traffic appropriately.
D.
Deploy a NAT instance that is configured with port forwarding to the EC2 instances in the Auto Scaling group.

Answer: A

Explanation:
UDP can only be monitored by NLB.
ALB is for application layer (HTTP etc)
R53 is DNS
NAT is for port forwarding/address translation etc which is not going to help with scaling

Question 605
A company runs several websites on AWS for its different brands. Each website generates tens of gigabytes of web traffic logs each day. A solutions architect needs to design a scalable solution to give the company's developers the ability to analyze traffic patterns across all the company's websites. This analysis by the developers will occur on demand once a week over the course of several months. The solution must support queries with standard SQL.
Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?
A.
Store the logs in Amazon S3. Use Amazon Athena tor analysis.
B.
Store the logs in Amazon RDS. Use a database client for analysis.
C.
Store the logs in Amazon OpenSearch Service. Use OpenSearch Service for analysis.
D.
Store the logs in an Amazon EMR cluster Use a supported open-source framework for SQL-based analysis.

Answer: A

Explanation:
Scalable + "The solution must support queries with standard SQL" = A
B not scalable
C OpenSearch is like ElasticSearch so does not support SQL syntax
D EMR is processing not storage. Map-Reduce can use SQL like syntax but this option does not solve scalable storage issues. You normally run EMR on some stored data

Question 606
An international company has a subdomain for each country that the company operates in. The subdomains are formatted as example.com, country1.example.com, and country2.example.com. The company's workloads are behind an Application Load Balancer. The company wants to encrypt the website data that is in transit.
Which combination of steps will meet these requirements? (Choose two.)
A.
Use the AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) console to request a public certificate for the apex top domain example com and a wildcard certificate for *.example.com.
B.
Use the AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) console to request a private certificate for the apex top domain example.com and a wildcard certificate for *.example.com.
C.
Use the AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) console to request a public and private certificate for the apex top domain example.com.
D.
Validate domain ownership by email address. Switch to DNS validation by adding the required DNS records to the DNS provider.
E.
Validate domain ownership for the domain by adding the required DNS records to the DNS provider.

Answer: AE

Explanation:
B is private certificate so won't help as that is for internal use
C is for apex domain only and won't help with wildcard domain
A is correct
DE are both doable as per these articles
D: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/dns-validation.html
E: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/domain-ownership-validation.html
D is less applicable because it does not say if R53 is being used for DNS. You only validate ownership to R53
C makes more sense as it applies to both R53 and other DNS providers

Question 607
A company is required to use cryptographic keys in its on-premises key manager. The key manager is outside of the AWS Cloud because of regulatory and compliance requirements. The company wants to manage encryption and decryption by using cryptographic keys that are retained outside of the AWS Cloud and that support a variety of external key managers from different vendors.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?
A.
Use AWS CloudHSM key store backed by a CloudHSM cluster.
B.
Use an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) external key store backed by an external key manager.
C.
Use the default AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) managed key store.
D.
Use a custom key store backed by an AWS CloudHSM cluster.

Answer: A?B?

Explanation:
A
This solution is the LEAST operational overhead because it does not require the company to manage any infrastructure or software outside of the AWS Cloud. The AWS CloudHSM key store is managed by AWS, and the company can use it to store and manage its cryptographic keys without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure or software. The CloudHSM cluster is managed by AWS, and the company can use it to create and manage its cryptographic keys without having to worry about the hardware or software.
the AWS CloudHSM key store can also be used for external key managers. The AWS CloudHSM key store is a managed key store that is backed by an AWS CloudHSM cluster. The AWS CloudHSM cluster is a managed service that is provided by AWS.

B
Answer A does not comply because aws cloudHSM is within aws
Answer B is the correct answer because the company is required to use its on-premises key manager. Following https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/custom-key-store-overview.html gives :An external key store is an AWS KMS custom key store backed by an external key manager outside of AWS that you own and control.(...)
Answer C and D are both solutions in the aws cloud so that does not fit.

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/keystore-external.html

Option A (Amazon FSx for Lustre scratch file systems) is designed for temporary data storage and does not provide the data persistence required for this scenario.

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/LustreGuide/using-fsx-lustre.html
Both AB can handle the processing requirements but B is Highly Available which is also a requirement not met by A.
CD won't mee the performance requirements

Question 611
An ecommerce company runs a PostgreSQL database on premises. The database stores data by using high IOPS Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) block storage. The daily peak I/O transactions per second do not exceed 15,000 IOPS. The company wants to migrate the database to Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL and provision disk IOPS performance independent of disk storage capacity.
Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?
A.
Configure the General Purpose SSD (gp2) EBS volume storage type and provision 15,000 IOPS.
B.
Configure the Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1) EBS volume storage type and provision 15,000 IOPS.
C.
Configure the General Purpose SSD (gp3) EBS volume storage type and provision 15,000 IOPS.
D.
Configure the EBS magnetic volume type to achieve maximum IOPS.

Answer: C

Explanation:
GP2 - • Size of the volume and IOPS are linked, max IOPS is 16,000
GP3 - Can increase IOPS up to 16,000 and throughput up to 1000 MiB/s independently
GP3 is 20% cheaper than GP2

Question 612
A hospital recently deployed a RESTful API with Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda. The hospital uses API Gateway and Lambda to upload reports that are in PDF format and JPEG format. The hospital needs to modify the Lambda code to identify protected health information (PHI) in the reports.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?
A.
Use existing Python libraries to extract the text from the reports and to identify the PHI from the extracted text.
B.
Use Amazon Textract to extract the text from the reports. Use Amazon SageMaker to identify the PHI from the extracted text.
C.
Use Amazon Textract to extract the text from the reports. Use Amazon Comprehend Medical to identify the PHI from the extracted text.
D.
Use Amazon Rekognition to extract the text from the reports. Use Amazon Comprehend Medical to identify the PHI from the extracted text.

Answer: C

Explanation:
C leverages capabilities of Textract, which is a service that automatically extracts text and data from documents, including PDF and JPEG. By using Textract, hospital can extract text content from reports without need for additional custom code or libraries.
Once text is extracted, hospital can then use Comprehend Medical, a natural language processing service specifically designed for medical text, to analyze and identify PHI. It can recognize medical entities such as medical conditions, treatments, and patient information.
A. suggests using existing Python libraries, which would require hospital to develop and maintain custom code for text extraction and PHI identification.
B and D involve using Textract along with SageMaker or Rekognition, respectively, for PHI identification. While these options could work, they introduce additional complexity by incorporating machine learning models and training.

Answer: A

Explanation:
B - Not the LEAST operational Overhead.
C - It is No-Sql - Not compatible with SQL server which is SQL
D - MS Sql Server to MySQL may miss out some SQL Server functionalities.
A - Read replicas for RDS is easy to create and also it is Asynchronous which should not be a problem for the analytics teams as they can bear 2-3 minutes delay

Question 614
A company stores a large volume of image files in an Amazon S3 bucket. The images need to be readily available for the first 180 days. The images are infrequently accessed for the next 180 days. After 360 days, the images need to be archived but must be available instantly upon request. After 5 years, only auditors can access the images. The auditors must be able to retrieve the images within 12 hours. The images cannot be lost during this process.
A developer will use S3 Standard storage for the first 180 days. The developer needs to configure an S3 Lifecycle rule.
Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?
A.
Transition the objects to S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA) after 180 days. S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval after 360 days, and S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 5 years.
B.
Transition the objects to S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA) after 180 days. S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval after 360 days, and S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 5 years.
C.
Transition the objects to S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) after 180 days, S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval after 360 days, and S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 5 years.
D.
Transition the objects to S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) after 180 days, S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval after 360 days, and S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 5 years.

Answer: A?C?

Explanation:
A
Here's why this option is the most cost-effective:
+S3 One Zone-IA (after 180 days): Offers lower storage costs compared to S3 Standard for infrequently accessed data (180 - 360 days) while maintaining good availability for retrieval.
+S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval (after 360 days): Provides immediate access to archived images (360 - 5 years) at a significantly lower cost than S3 Standard storage. Retrieval costs are incurred but typically lower than keeping the data in S3 Standard.
+S3 Glacier Deep Archive (after 5 years): Offers the lowest storage cost for long-term archival (beyond 5 years) with retrieval times within 12 hours, meeting the auditor access requirement and minimizing ongoing storage costs.

C
Images cannot be lost = high availability.
Transition the objects to S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) after 180 days, S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval after 360 days, and S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 5 years.

Question 615
A company has a large data workload that runs for 6 hours each day. The company cannot lose any data while the process is running. A solutions architect is designing an Amazon EMR cluster configuration to support this critical data workload.
Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?
A.
Configure a long-running cluster that runs the primary node and core nodes on On-Demand Instances and the task nodes on Spot Instances.
B.
Configure a transient cluster that runs the primary node and core nodes on On-Demand Instances and the task nodes on Spot Instances.
C.
Configure a transient cluster that runs the primary node on an On-Demand Instance and the core nodes and task nodes on Spot Instances.
D.
Configure a long-running cluster that runs the primary node on an On-Demand Instance, the core nodes on Spot Instances, and the task nodes on Spot Instances.

Answer: B

Explanation:
A transient cluster provides cost savings because it runs only during the computation time, and it provides scalability and flexibility in a cloud environment. 
Option C (transient cluster with On-Demand primary node and Spot core and task nodes) exposes the core nodes to Spot Instance interruptions, which may not be acceptable for a workload that cannot lose any data.

Option A suggests a long-running cluster, which continues to run until manually terminated. This means that even if tasks are rerouted due to Spot Instance interruptions, the cluster itself remains active, allowing the rerouted tasks to complete on other nodes.
Option B suggests a transient cluster, which is terminated after all steps are completed. If the Spot Instances are interrupted and tasks are not completed, the cluster might still terminate after the steps are deemed complete, potentially leading to incomplete processing of data.

Question 616
A company maintains an Amazon RDS database that maps users to cost centers. The company has accounts in an organization in AWS Organizations. The company needs a solution that will tag all resources that are created in a specific AWS account in the organization. The solution must tag each resource with the cost center ID of the user who created the resource.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Move the specific AWS account to a new organizational unit (OU) in Organizations from the management account. Create a service control policy (SCP) that requires all existing resources to have the correct cost center tag before the resources are created. Apply the SCP to the new OU.
B.
Create an AWS Lambda function to tag the resources after the Lambda function looks up the appropriate cost center from the RDS database. Configure an Amazon EventBridge rule that reacts to AWS CloudTrail events to invoke the Lambda function.
C.
Create an AWS CloudFormation stack to deploy an AWS Lambda function. Configure the Lambda function to look up the appropriate cost center from the RDS database and to tag resources. Create an Amazon EventBridge scheduled rule to invoke the CloudFormation stack.
D.
Create an AWS Lambda function to tag the resources with a default value. Configure an Amazon EventBridge rule that reacts to AWS CloudTrail events to invoke the Lambda function when a resource is missing the cost center tag.

Answer: A?B?

Explanation:
A
SCP handles the assignment, no need for a Lambda function, that's unnecessary t seems like
Service Control Policies (SCPs)
SCPs are a policy type that you can utilize to manage permissions across accounts in your AWS Organization.
Using SCPs lets you ensure that your accounts stay within your organization’s access control guidelines.
SCPs can be used along-side tag policies to ensure that the tags are applied at the resource creation time and remain attached to the resource.

B
The best solution that meets all the requirements is option B. Here's why:
It can tag all resources created in a specific AWS account within the organization.
It uses a Lambda function to look up the appropriate cost center from the RDS database, ensuring accurate tagging.
The EventBridge rule reacting to CloudTrail events ensures that resources are tagged as they are created.
This approach can dynamically tag each resource with the cost center ID of the user who created it.

A policy cannot look up "the cost center ID of the user who created the resource", we need Lambda to do that. Thus A is out.
C would work but runs on a schedule which doesn't make sense (and we would temporarily have untagged resources).
D tags resources "with a default value" which is not what we want.

Question 617
A company recently migrated its web application to the AWS Cloud. The company uses an Amazon EC2 instance to run multiple processes to host the application. The processes include an Apache web server that serves static content. The Apache web server makes requests to a PHP application that uses a local Redis server for user sessions.
The company wants to redesign the architecture to be highly available and to use AWS managed solutions.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Use AWS Elastic Beanstalk to host the static content and the PHP application. Configure Elastic Beanstalk to deploy its EC2 instance into a public subnet. Assign a public IP address.
B.
Use AWS Lambda to host the static content and the PHP application. Use an Amazon API Gateway REST API to proxy requests to the Lambda function. Set the API Gateway CORS configuration to respond to the domain name. Configure Amazon ElastiCache for Redis to handle session information.
C.
Keep the backend code on the EC2 instance. Create an Amazon ElastiCache for Redis cluster that has Multi-AZ enabled. Configure the ElastiCache for Redis cluster in cluster mode. Copy the frontend resources to Amazon S3. Configure the backend code to reference the EC2 instance.
D.
Configure an Amazon CloudFront distribution with an Amazon S3 endpoint to an S3 bucket that is configured to host the static content. Configure an Application Load Balancer that targets an Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) service that runs AWS Fargate tasks for the PHP application. Configure the PHP application to use an Amazon ElastiCache for Redis cluster that runs in multiple Availability Zones.

Answer: D

Explanation:
Key requirements: HA and Managed Services
Key components: PHP, Static content, Redis Elasticache
AB are instantly useless for static content scaling
C could work but is less managed and "configure the backend code to reference EC2 instance" makes no sense
D ECS+Linux+PHP is good managed combination when used with Fargate. S3 for static is well-architected. Multi-AZ ECache for Redis is HA also. Good managed solution for all purposes.

Question 618
A company runs a web application on Amazon EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group that has a target group. The company designed the application to work with session affinity (sticky sessions) for a better user experience.
The application must be available publicly over the internet as an endpoint. A WAF must be applied to the endpoint for additional security. Session affinity (sticky sessions) must be configured on the endpoint.
Which combination of steps will meet these requirements? (Choose two.)
A.
Create a public Network Load Balancer. Specify the application target group.
B.
Create a Gateway Load Balancer. Specify the application target group.
C.
Create a public Application Load Balancer. Specify the application target group.
D.
Create a second target group. Add Elastic IP addresses to the EC2 instances.
E.
Create a web ACL in AWS WAF. Associate the web ACL with the endpoint

Answer: CE

Explanation:
NLB and GLB cannot handle sticky sessions. It's an application level concept (Cookies) so ALB works.
Elastic IP will negate sticky sessions and this combination won't work.
E give proper permissions to WAF

Question 619
A company runs a website that stores images of historical events. Website users need the ability to search and view images based on the year that the event in the image occurred. On average, users request each image only once or twice a year. The company wants a highly available solution to store and deliver the images to users.
Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?
A.
Store images in Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS). Use a web server that runs on Amazon EC2.
B.
Store images in Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS). Use a web server that runs on Amazon EC2.
C.
Store images in Amazon S3 Standard. Use S3 Standard to directly deliver images by using a static website.
D.
Store images in Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA). Use S3 Standard-IA to directly deliver images by using a static website.

Answer: D

Explanation:
Store images in Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA). Use S3 Standard-IA to directly deliver images by using a static website.
S3 Standard-IA is designed specifically for infrequently accessed data, offering lower storage costs compared to S3 Standard while still providing the necessary durability and availability.

Question 620
A company has multiple AWS accounts in an organization in AWS Organizations that different business units use. The company has multiple offices around the world. The company needs to update security group rules to allow new office CIDR ranges or to remove old CIDR ranges across the organization. The company wants to centralize the management of security group rules to minimize the administrative overhead that updating CIDR ranges requires.
Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?
A.
Create VPC security groups in the organization's management account. Update the security groups when a CIDR range update is necessary.
B.
Create a VPC customer managed prefix list that contains the list of CIDRs. Use AWS Resource Access Manager (AWS RAM) to share the prefix list across the organization. Use the prefix list in the security groups across the organization.
C.
Create an AWS managed prefix list. Use an AWS Security Hub policy to enforce the security group update across the organization. Use an AWS Lambda function to update the prefix list automatically when the CIDR ranges change.
D.
Create security groups in a central administrative AWS account. Create an AWS Firewall Manager common security group policy for the whole organization. Select the previously created security groups as primary groups in the policy.

Answer: B

Explanation:
A managed prefix list is a set of one or more CIDR blocks. You can use prefix lists to make it easier to configure and maintain your security groups and route tables. You can create a prefix list from the IP addresses that you frequently use, and reference them as a set in security group rules and routes instead of referencing them individually. If you scale your network and need to allow traffic from another CIDR block, you can update the relevant prefix list and all security groups that use the prefix list are updated. You can also use managed prefix lists with other AWS accounts using Resource Access Manager (RAM).

Question 621
A company uses an on-premises network-attached storage (NAS) system to provide file shares to its high performance computing (HPC) workloads. The company wants to migrate its latency-sensitive HPC workloads and its storage to the AWS Cloud. The company must be able to provide NFS and SMB multi-protocol access from the file system.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST latency? (Choose two.)
A.
Deploy compute optimized EC2 instances into a cluster placement group.
B.
Deploy compute optimized EC2 instances into a partition placement group.
C.
Attach the EC2 instances to an Amazon FSx for Lustre file system.
D.
Attach the EC2 instances to an Amazon FSx for OpenZFS file system.
E.
Attach the EC2 instances to an Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP file system.

Answer: AE

Explanation:
A Because HPC equivalent in AWS is EC2. Cluster placement for low-latency: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/placement-groups.html
E: ONTAP gives NFS and SMB which is required 
AE is correct
B does not solve low latency requirements
C No support for NFS and SMB
D OpenZFS is not required

Question 622
A company is relocating its data center and wants to securely transfer 50 TB of data to AWS within 2 weeks. The existing data center has a Site-to-Site VPN connection to AWS that is 90% utilized.
Which AWS service should a solutions architect use to meet these requirements?
A.
AWS DataSync with a VPC endpoint
B.
AWS Direct Connect
C.
AWS Snowball Edge Storage Optimized
D.
AWS Storage Gateway

Answer: B?C?

Explanation:
B
(B) is correct.
Direct Connect is "A dedicated connection [is] made through a 1-Gbps, 10-Gbps, or 100-Gbps Ethernet port dedicated to a single customer." DX uses 802.1Q VLANs providing a dedicated private network connection to AWS. At 1-Gbps, transfer takes less than 5 days; at 100-Gbps it takes less than 67 minutes. Since it's a data center & not an oil rig in the middle of the Gulf of Mexico, data center should be able to get this service.
(C) is incorrect
"Consider Snowball Edge if you need to run computing in rugged, austere, mobile, or disconnected (or intermittently connected) environments. Also consider it for large-scale data transfers and migrations when bandwidth is not available for use of a high-speed online transfer service, such as AWS DataSync."

C
A DataSync is for data
B Direct connect takes longer than 2 weeks
D StorageGateway is useless without more contex
C is only remaining choice.

Question 623
A company has an application that generates a large number of files, each approximately 5 MB in size. The files are stored in Amazon S3. Company policy requires the files to be stored for 4 years before they can be deleted. Immediate accessibility is always required as the files contain critical business data that is not easy to reproduce. The files are frequently accessed in the first 30 days of the object creation but are rarely accessed after the first 30 days.
Which storage solution is MOST cost-effective?
A.
Create an S3 bucket lifecycle policy to move files from S3 Standard to S3 Glacier 30 days from object creation. Delete the files 4 years after object creation.
B.
Create an S3 bucket lifecycle policy to move files from S3 Standard to S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA) 30 days from object creation. Delete the files 4 years after object creation.
C.
Create an S3 bucket lifecycle policy to move files from S3 Standard to S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) 30 days from object creation. Delete the files 4 years after object creation.
D.
Create an S3 bucket lifecycle policy to move files from S3 Standard to S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) 30 days from object creation. Move the files to S3 Glacier 4 years after object creation.

Answer: A?B?C?

Explanation:
A
S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval is a new storage class that delivers the fastest access to archive storage, with the same low latency and high-throughput performance as the S3 Standard and S3 Standard-IA storage classes. You can save up to 68 percent on storage costs as compared with using the S3 Standard-IA storage class when you use the S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval storage class and pay a low price to retrieve data.

B
Based on the information provided, the most cost-effective storage solution would be option B: Create an S3 bucket lifecycle policy to move files from S3 Standard to S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA) 30 days from object creation. Delete the files 4 years after object creation.
S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA) is a storage class that is similar to S3 Standard-IA but is designed for even lower-cost storage and is suited for data that can be recovered from other Availability Zones in the event of an outage or disaster. S3 One Zone-IA is a good choice for storing data that is not accessed frequently and can be stored in a single availability zone, making it the most cost-effective option in this case.
https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2018/04/announcing-s3-one-zone-infrequent-access-a-new-amazon-s3-storage-class/

C
"Immediate accessibility is always required". It can't be a, since Glacier Instant Retrieval has a limit of times the data can be accessed.
"S3 Glacier Retrieval is the lowest cost archive storage with milliseconds retrieval for rarely accessed data. It is ideal for data that is accessed once or twice per quarter, and that requires immediate access."

Question 624
A company hosts an application on Amazon EC2 On-Demand Instances in an Auto Scaling group. Application peak hours occur at the same time each day. Application users report slow application performance at the start of peak hours. The application performs normally 2-3 hours after peak hours begin. The company wants to ensure that the application works properly at the start of peak hours.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Configure an Application Load Balancer to distribute traffic properly to the instances.
B.
Configure a dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on memory utilization.
C.
Configure a dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on CPU utilization.
D.
Configure a scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before peak hours.

Answer: D

Explanation:
Techincally both dynamic and scheduled scaling would work but there is strict requirement for the application to work properly at the start of peak hours and no mention of cost.
So scheduled scaling policy it is.

Question 625
A company runs applications on AWS that connect to the company's Amazon RDS database. The applications scale on weekends and at peak times of the year. The company wants to scale the database more effectively for its applications that connect to the database.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?
A.
Use Amazon DynamoDB with connection pooling with a target group configuration for the database. Change the applications to use the DynamoDB endpoint.
B.
Use Amazon RDS Proxy with a target group for the database. Change the applications to use the RDS Proxy endpoint.
C.
Use a custom proxy that runs on Amazon EC2 as an intermediary to the database. Change the applications to use the custom proxy endpoint.
D.
Use an AWS Lambda function to provide connection pooling with a target group configuration for the database. Change the applications to use the Lambda function.

Answer: B

Explanation:
Amazon RDS Proxy is a fully managed, highly available database proxy for Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) that makes applications more resilient to database failures. Many applications, including those built on modern serverless architectures, can have a large number of open connections to the database server and may open and close database connections at a high rate, exhausting database memory and compute resources. Amazon RDS Proxy allows applications to pool and share connections established with the database, improving database efficiency and application scalability. With RDS Proxy, failover times for Aurora and RDS databases are reduced by up to 66%

Question 626
A company uses AWS Cost Explorer to monitor its AWS costs. The company notices that Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) storage and snapshot costs increase every month. However, the company does not purchase additional EBS storage every month. The company wants to optimize monthly costs for its current storage usage.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?
A.
Use logs in Amazon CloudWatch Logs to monitor the storage utilization of Amazon EBS. Use Amazon EBS Elastic Volumes to reduce the size of the EBS volumes.
B.
Use a custom script to monitor space usage. Use Amazon EBS Elastic Volumes to reduce the size of the EBS volumes.
C.
Delete all expired and unused snapshots to reduce snapshot costs.
D.
Delete all nonessential snapshots. Use Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager to create and manage the snapshots according to the company's snapshot policy requirements.

Answer: D

Explanation:
This option involves managing snapshots efficiently to optimize costs with minimal operational overhead.
Delete all nonessential snapshots: This reduces costs by eliminating unnecessary snapshot storage.
Use Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager (DLM): DLM can automate the creation and deletion of snapshots based on defined policies. This reduces operational overhead by automating snapshot management according to the company's snapshot policy requirements.

Question 627
A company is developing a new application on AWS. The application consists of an Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) cluster, an Amazon S3 bucket that contains assets for the application, and an Amazon RDS for MySQL database that contains the dataset for the application. The dataset contains sensitive information. The company wants to ensure that only the ECS cluster can access the data in the RDS for MySQL database and the data in the S3 bucket.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Create a new AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer managed key to encrypt both the S3 bucket and the RDS for MySQL database. Ensure that the KMS key policy includes encrypt and decrypt permissions for the ECS task execution role.
B.
Create an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) AWS managed key to encrypt both the S3 bucket and the RDS for MySQL database. Ensure that the S3 bucket policy specifies the ECS task execution role as a user.
C.
Create an S3 bucket policy that restricts bucket access to the ECS task execution role. Create a VPC endpoint for Amazon RDS for MySQL. Update the RDS for MySQL security group to allow access from only the subnets that the ECS cluster will generate tasks in.
D.
Create a VPC endpoint for Amazon RDS for MySQL. Update the RDS for MySQL security group to allow access from only the subnets that the ECS cluster will generate tasks in. Create a VPC endpoint for Amazon S3. Update the S3 bucket policy to allow access from only the S3 VPC endpoint.

Answer: A?C?D?

Explanation:
A
We're asked to restrict access to both, RDS and S3, to "the ECS cluster" (not to a subnet or endpoint).
Not B: Does not restrict RDS at all. Wording about S3 is unusual.
Not C: Would work for S3, but would allow RDS access from whole subnet which may contain other resources besides the ECS cluster
Not D: Would allow RDS access from whole subnet which may contain other resources besides the ECS cluster. Would allow S3 access from VPC endpoint which might be accessed by other resources besides the ECS cluster.

C
The question specifically asks to ensure that only the ECS cluster can access the data, which means restricting access to the S3 bucket and RDS database solely to the ECS task execution role.
Breakdown of option C:
S3 bucket policy: By creating a policy that only allows the ECS task execution role to access the S3 bucket, you effectively limit access to the data stored there.
VPC endpoint for RDS: A VPC endpoint creates a private connection to the RDS database, preventing any external access and ensuring that only resources within the VPC can connect.
RDS security group update: Further restricting access by configuring the RDS security group to only allow connections from the subnets where the ECS cluster will launch tasks.

D
Create a VPC endpoint for Amazon RDS for MySQL: This ensures that the ECS cluster can access the RDS database directly within the same Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), without having to go over the internet. By updating the security group to allow access only from the specific subnets that the ECS cluster will generate tasks in, you limit access to only the authorized entities.
Create a VPC endpoint for Amazon S3: This allows the ECS cluster to access the S3 bucket directly within the same VPC. By updating the S3 bucket policy to allow access only from the S3 VPC endpoint, you restrict access to the designated VPC, ensuring that only authorized resources can access the S3 bucket.

Question 628
A company has a web application that runs on premises. The application experiences latency issues during peak hours. The latency issues occur twice each month. At the start of a latency issue, the application's CPU utilization immediately increases to 10 times its normal amount.
The company wants to migrate the application to AWS to improve latency. The company also wants to scale the application automatically when application demand increases. The company will use AWS Elastic Beanstalk for application deployment.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Configure an Elastic Beanstalk environment to use burstable performance instances in unlimited mode. Configure the environment to scale based on requests.
B.
Configure an Elastic Beanstalk environment to use compute optimized instances. Configure the environment to scale based on requests.
C.
Configure an Elastic Beanstalk environment to use compute optimized instances. Configure the environment to scale on a schedule.
D.
Configure an Elastic Beanstalk environment to use burstable performance instances in unlimited mode. Configure the environment to scale on predictive metrics.

Answer: A?D?

Explanation:
A
BC are compute optimised instances which don't solve 10x CPU issues at start of the latency.
AD are burstable performance which will help with 10x increase CPU usage
D is not an available feature of Elastic Beanstalk (yet) or I cannot find it in config/docs. Happy to be corrected
A makes sense due to burst performance. Scale based on requests is possible and I'm assuming that latency is related to requests.

D
Burstable Performance Instances (T3 or T3a): These instances are designed for burstable workloads and provide a baseline level of CPU performance with the ability to burst above that baseline when needed. Bursting is particularly beneficial for handling sudden spikes in CPU utilization, such as those described in the scenario.
Unlimited Mode: Enabling "unlimited" mode allows instances to burst beyond their baseline performance without accumulating CPU credits. This is important for handling sudden and sustained increases in CPU utilization during peak hours.
Scale on Predictive Metrics: Configuring the environment to scale on predictive metrics allows AWS Elastic Beanstalk to proactively adjust the number of instances based on anticipated demand. This can help ensure that the environment is scaled up before the latency issues occur, addressing them in advance.



Question 629
A company has customers located across the world. The company wants to use automation to secure its systems and network infrastructure. The company's security team must be able to track and audit all incremental changes to the infrastructure.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Use AWS Organizations to set up the infrastructure. Use AWS Config to track changes.
B.
Use AWS CloudFormation to set up the infrastructure. Use AWS Config to track changes.
C.
Use AWS Organizations to set up the infrastructure. Use AWS Service Catalog to track changes.
D.
Use AWS CloudFormation to set up the infrastructure. Use AWS Service Catalog to track changes.

Answer: B

Explanation:
Option B is the most suitable because it combines the benefits of infrastructure as code (CloudFormation) with tracking and auditing capabilities (AWS Config). With CloudFormation, the company can define and deploy its infrastructure in a repeatable and automated way, ensuring consistency and adherence to security standards. AWS Config then complements this by providing visibility into changes and configuration details.

Question 630
A startup company is hosting a website for its customers on an Amazon EC2 instance. The website consists of a stateless Python application and a MySQL database. The website serves only a small amount of traffic. The company is concerned about the reliability of the instance and needs to migrate to a highly available architecture. The company cannot modify the application code.
Which combination of actions should a solutions architect take to achieve high availability for the website? (Choose two.)
A.
Provision an internet gateway in each Availability Zone in use.
B.
Migrate the database to an Amazon RDS for MySQL Multi-AZ DB instance.
C.
Migrate the database to Amazon DynamoDB, and enable DynamoDB auto scaling.
D.
Use AWS DataSync to synchronize the database data across multiple EC2 instances.
E.
Create an Application Load Balancer to distribute traffic to an Auto Scaling group of EC2 instances that are distributed across two Availability Zones.

Answer: BE

Explanation:

Question 631
A company is moving its data and applications to AWS during a multiyear migration project. The company wants to securely access data on Amazon S3 from the company's AWS Region and from the company's on-premises location. The data must not traverse the internet. The company has established an AWS Direct Connect connection between its Region and its on-premises location.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Create gateway endpoints for Amazon S3. Use the gateway endpoints to securely access the data from the Region and the on-premises location.
B.
Create a gateway in AWS Transit Gateway to access Amazon S3 securely from the Region and the on-premises location.
C.
Create interface endpoints for Amazon S3. Use the interface endpoints to securely access the data from the Region and the on-premises location.
D.
Use an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key to access the data securely from the Region and the on-premises location.

Answer: C

Explanation:
You can access Amazon S3 from your VPC using gateway VPC endpoints. After you create the gateway endpoint, you can add it as a target in your route table for traffic destined from your VPC to Amazon S3.
There is no additional charge for using gateway endpoints. Amazon S3 supports both gateway endpoints and interface endpoints. With a gateway endpoint, you can access Amazon S3 from your VPC, without requiring an internet gateway or NAT device for your VPC, and with no additional cost. However, gateway endpoints do not allow access from on-premises networks, from peered VPCs in other AWS Regions, or through a transit gateway. For those scenarios, you must use an interface endpoint, which is available for an additional cost. For more information, see Types of VPC endpoints for Amazon S3 in the Amazon S3 User Guide.
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/vpc-endpoints-s3.html

Question 632
A company created a new organization in AWS Organizations. The organization has multiple accounts for the company's development teams. The development team members use AWS IAM Identity Center (AWS Single Sign-On) to access the accounts. For each of the company's applications, the development teams must use a predefined application name to tag resources that are created.
A solutions architect needs to design a solution that gives the development team the ability to create resources only if the application name tag has an approved value.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Create an IAM group that has a conditional Allow policy that requires the application name tag to be specified for resources to be created.
B.
Create a cross-account role that has a Deny policy for any resource that has the application name tag.
C.
Create a resource group in AWS Resource Groups to validate that the tags are applied to all resources in all accounts.
D.
Create a tag policy in Organizations that has a list of allowed application names.

Answer: D

Explanation:
A: Don't think this is possible.
B: Cross account role with deny policy? Never seen anything like this
C: Resource groups have nothing to do with allowed tags
D: Correct https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_tag-policies.html

Question 633
A company runs its databases on Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL. The company wants a secure solution to manage the master user password by rotating the password every 30 days.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?
A.
Use Amazon EventBridge to schedule a custom AWS Lambda function to rotate the password every 30 days.
B.
Use the modify-db-instance command in the AWS CLI to change the password.
C.
Integrate AWS Secrets Manager with Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL to automate password rotation.
D.
Integrate AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store with Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL to automate password rotation.

Answer: C

Explanation:
"Least operational overhead"
A: Lambda overhead so not correct
B: CLI = overhead
D: Yes, it can be done but requires more work for integration.
C: This is correct way of doing it.

Question 634
A company hosts an application on multiple Amazon EC2 instances. The application processes messages from an Amazon SQS queue, writes to an Amazon RDS table, and deletes the message from the queue. Occasional duplicate records are found in the RDS table. The SQS queue does not contain any duplicate messages.
What should a solutions architect do to ensure messages are being processed once only?
A.
Use the CreateQueue API call to create a new queue.
B.
Use the AddPermission API call to add appropriate permissions.
C.
Use the ReceiveMessage API call to set an appropriate wait time.
D.
Use the ChangeMessageVisibility API call to increase the visibility timeout.

Answer: D

Explanation:
The visibility timeout is the duration during which SQS prevents other consumers from receiving and processing the same message. By increasing the visibility timeout, you allow more time for the processing of a message to complete before it becomes visible to other consumers.
Option A, creating a new queue, does not address the issue of concurrent processing and duplicate records. It would only create a new queue, which is not necessary for solving the problem.
Option B, adding permissions, also does not directly address the issue of duplicate records. Permissions are necessary for accessing the SQS queue but not for preventing concurrent processing.
Option C, setting an appropriate wait time using the ReceiveMessage API call, does not specifically prevent duplicate records. It can help manage the rate at which messages are received from the queue but does not address the issue of concurrent processing.

Question 635
A company performs tests on an application that uses an Amazon DynamoDB table. The tests run for 4 hours once a week. The company knows how many read and write operations the application performs to the table each second during the tests. The company does not currently use DynamoDB for any other use case. A solutions architect needs to optimize the costs for the table.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Choose on-demand mode. Update the read and write capacity units appropriately.
B.
Choose provisioned mode. Update the read and write capacity units appropriately.
C.
Purchase DynamoDB reserved capacity for a 1-year term.
D.
Purchase DynamoDB reserved capacity for a 3-year term.

Answer: A?B?

Explanation:
A
On-demand mode Option A: On-demand mode is suitable for workloads that are unpredictable or that do not have significant or consistent database traffic. It automatically scales to accommodate workload demands and charges for the read and write throughput that the application consumes. For infrequent testing, this could be cost-effective because you only pay for what you use during the testing period and don't incur costs when the table is not being accessed.
Whereas for the Option B, if you only run tests once a week for 4 hours, you might pay for unused capacity for the rest of the week unless you manually scale down the capacity after tests are completed, which adds operational overhead.

B
DynamoDB On-Demand pricing is about 6.94x the cost of provisioned capacity. If your applications have predictable traffic patterns and you don't mind spending the time to understand those patterns, using DynamoDB's provisioned throughput capacity can save you money. 
Also can't set any capacity units for on-demand mode, so A is false in it's premise.

Question 636
A company runs its applications on Amazon EC2 instances. The company performs periodic financial assessments of its AWS costs. The company recently identified unusual spending.
The company needs a solution to prevent unusual spending. The solution must monitor costs and notify responsible stakeholders in the event of unusual spending.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Use an AWS Budgets template to create a zero spend budget.
B.
Create an AWS Cost Anomaly Detection monitor in the AWS Billing and Cost Management console.
C.
Create AWS Pricing Calculator estimates for the current running workload pricing details.
D.
Use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor costs and to identify unusual spending.

Answer: B

Explanation:
AWS Cost Anomaly Detection (Option B): AWS Cost Anomaly Detection is designed to automatically detect unusual spending patterns based on machine learning algorithms. It can identify anomalies and send notifications when it detects unexpected changes in spending. This aligns well with the requirement to prevent unusual spending and notify stakeholders.

Question 637
A marketing company receives a large amount of new clickstream data in Amazon S3 from a marketing campaign. The company needs to analyze the clickstream data in Amazon S3 quickly. Then the company needs to determine whether to process the data further in the data pipeline.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?
A.
Create external tables in a Spark catalog. Configure jobs in AWS Glue to query the data.
B.
Configure an AWS Glue crawler to crawl the data. Configure Amazon Athena to query the data.
C.
Create external tables in a Hive metastore. Configure Spark jobs in Amazon EMR to query the data.
D.
Configure an AWS Glue crawler to crawl the data. Configure Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics to use SQL to query the data.

Answer: B

Explanation:
AWS Glue with Athena (Option B): AWS Glue is a fully managed extract, transform, and load (ETL) service, and Athena is a serverless query service that allows you to analyze data directly in Amazon S3 using SQL queries. By configuring an AWS Glue crawler to crawl the data, you can create a schema for the data, and then use Athena to query the data directly without the need to load it into a separate database. This minimizes operational overhead.

Question 638
A company runs an SMB file server in its data center. The file server stores large files that the company frequently accesses for up to 7 days after the file creation date. After 7 days, the company needs to be able to access the files with a maximum retrieval time of 24 hours.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Use AWS DataSync to copy data that is older than 7 days from the SMB file server to AWS.
B.
Create an Amazon S3 File Gateway to increase the company's storage space. Create an S3 Lifecycle policy to transition the data to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 7 days.
C.
Create an Amazon FSx File Gateway to increase the company's storage space. Create an Amazon S3 Lifecycle policy to transition the data after 7 days.
D.
Configure access to Amazon S3 for each user. Create an S3 Lifecycle policy to transition the data to S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval after 7 days.

Answer: B

Explanation:
A: DataSync is not used for this
C: FSx File Gateway requires NFS on both sides so won't work with S3
D: Doesn't say how to transfer data to S3
B: S3 File Gateway will connect SMB to S3. Lifecycle policy will move objects to S3 Glacier Deep Archive which support 12 hours retrieval

Question 639
A company runs a web application on Amazon EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group. The application uses a database that runs on an Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance. The application performs slowly when traffic increases. The database experiences a heavy read load during periods of high traffic.
Which actions should a solutions architect take to resolve these performance issues? (Choose two.)
A.
Turn on auto scaling for the DB instance.
B.
Create a read replica for the DB instance. Configure the application to send read traffic to the read replica.
C.
Convert the DB instance to a Multi-AZ DB instance deployment. Configure the application to send read traffic to the standby DB instance.
D.
Create an Amazon ElastiCache cluster. Configure the application to cache query results in the ElastiCache cluster.
E.
Configure the Auto Scaling group subnets to ensure that the EC2 instances are provisioned in the same Availability Zone as the DB instance.

Answer: BD

Explanation:
A: RDS DB instance Autoscaling is not a thing
C: You cannot read from standby even if this was done.
E: Does not solve any problem
Correct answer
B: Read replicas distribute load and help improving performance
D: Caching of any kind will help with performance
Remember: " The database experiences a heavy read load during periods of high traffic."

Question 640
A company uses Amazon EC2 instances and Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes to run an application. The company creates one snapshot of each EBS volume every day to meet compliance requirements. The company wants to implement an architecture that prevents the accidental deletion of EBS volume snapshots. The solution must not change the administrative rights of the storage administrator user.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST administrative effort?
A.
Create an IAM role that has permission to delete snapshots. Attach the role to a new EC2 instance. Use the AWS CLI from the new EC2 instance to delete snapshots.
B.
Create an IAM policy that denies snapshot deletion. Attach the policy to the storage administrator user.
C.
Add tags to the snapshots. Create retention rules in Recycle Bin for EBS snapshots that have the tags.
D.
Lock the EBS snapshots to prevent deletion.

Answer: D

Explanation:
Locking EBS Snapshots (Option D): The "lock" feature in AWS allows you to prevent accidental deletion of resources, including EBS snapshots. This can be set at the snapshot level, providing a straightforward and effective way to meet the requirements without changing the administrative rights of the storage administrator user.

Question 641
A company's application uses Network Load Balancers, Auto Scaling groups, Amazon EC2 instances, and databases that are deployed in an Amazon VPC. The company wants to capture information about traffic to and from the network interfaces in near real time in its Amazon VPC. The company wants to send the information to Amazon OpenSearch Service for analysis.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Create a log group in Amazon CloudWatch Logs. Configure VPC Flow Logs to send the log data to the log group. Use Amazon Kinesis Data Streams to stream the logs from the log group to OpenSearch Service.
B.
Create a log group in Amazon CloudWatch Logs. Configure VPC Flow Logs to send the log data to the log group. Use Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose to stream the logs from the log group to OpenSearch Service.
C.
Create a trail in AWS CloudTrail. Configure VPC Flow Logs to send the log data to the trail. Use Amazon Kinesis Data Streams to stream the logs from the trail to OpenSearch Service.
D.
Create a trail in AWS CloudTrail. Configure VPC Flow Logs to send the log data to the trail. Use Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose to stream the logs from the trail to OpenSearch Service.

Answer: B

Explanation:
CloudTrail is for logging administrative actions, we need CloudWatch. We want the data in another AWS service (OpenSearch), not Kinesis, thus we need Firehose, not Streams.

Question 642
A company is developing an application that will run on a production Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) cluster. The EKS cluster has managed node groups that are provisioned with On-Demand Instances.
The company needs a dedicated EKS cluster for development work. The company will use the development cluster infrequently to test the resiliency of the application. The EKS cluster must manage all the nodes.
Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?
A.
Create a managed node group that contains only Spot Instances.
B.
Create two managed node groups. Provision one node group with On-Demand Instances. Provision the second node group with Spot Instances.
C.
Create an Auto Scaling group that has a launch configuration that uses Spot Instances. Configure the user data to add the nodes to the EKS cluster.
D.
Create a managed node group that contains only On-Demand Instances.

Answer: A?B?

Explanation:
A
I think the question is easy to misunderstand, whether you should create the whole setup or just the development cluster. But from the wording ("The [production] EKS cluster has (!) managed node groups ... The company needs a dedicated EKS cluster for development work"), I conclude that we should only create the development cluster.
As this will be used "infrequently" for testing purposes only, and it must be "most cost-effective", I'd go with A - new cluster with "one managed node group that contains only Spot instances".

B
- control plane running on on-demand EC2s
- worker nodes running on spot instances
Read this to understand correct solution:

Question 643
A company stores sensitive data in Amazon S3. A solutions architect needs to create an encryption solution. The company needs to fully control the ability of users to create, rotate, and disable encryption keys with minimal effort for any data that must be encrypted.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Use default server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed encryption keys (SSE-S3) to store the sensitive data.
B.
Create a customer managed key by using AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS). Use the new key to encrypt the S3 objects by using server-side encryption with AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS).
C.
Create an AWS managed key by using AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS). Use the new key to encrypt the S3 objects by using server-side encryption with AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS).
D.
Download S3 objects to an Amazon EC2 instance. Encrypt the objects by using customer managed keys. Upload the encrypted objects back into Amazon S3.

Answer: B

Explanation:
SSE-KMS with Customer Managed Key (Option B): This option allows you to create a customer managed key using AWS KMS. With a customer managed key, you have full control over key lifecycle management, including the ability to create, rotate, and disable keys with minimal effort. SSE-KMS also integrates with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) for fine-grained access control.

Question 644
A company wants to back up its on-premises virtual machines (VMs) to AWS. The company's backup solution exports on-premises backups to an Amazon S3 bucket as objects. The S3 backups must be retained for 30 days and must be automatically deleted after 30 days.
Which combination of steps will meet these requirements? (Choose three.)
A.
Create an S3 bucket that has S3 Object Lock enabled.
B.
Create an S3 bucket that has object versioning enabled.
C.
Configure a default retention period of 30 days for the objects.
D.
Configure an S3 Lifecycle policy to protect the objects for 30 days.
E.
Configure an S3 Lifecycle policy to expire the objects after 30 days.
F.
Configure the backup solution to tag the objects with a 30-day retention period

Answer: ACE?ADE?

Explanation:
ACE
In theory, E alone would be enough because the objects are "retained for 30 days" without any configuration as long as no one deletes them. But let's assume that they want us to prevent deletion.
A: Yes, required to prevent deletion. Object Lock requires Versioning, so if we 'create an S3 bucket that has S3 Object Lock enabled' that this also has object versioning enabled, otherwise we would not be able to create it.
B: No. We need versioning, but we cannot "create" the bucket twice. If we create it "with object lock enabled" then versioning is enabled too, but NOT the other way round (creating it with versioning enabled will not automatically enable object lock).

ADE
B: No versioning is required
D: Lifecycle is for transitioning or expiring. There is no protection lifecycle policy
F: No such tag
Enable object lock, retain for 30 days (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/batch-ops-retention-date.html) and expire after 30 days.

Question 645
A solutions architect is designing a new hybrid architecture to extend a company's on-premises infrastructure to AWS. The company requires a highly available connection with consistent low latency to an AWS Region. The company needs to minimize costs and is willing to accept slower traffic if the primary connection fails.
What should the solutions architect do to meet these requirements?
A.
Provision an AWS Direct Connect connection to a Region. Provision a VPN connection as a backup if the primary Direct Connect connection fails.
B.
Provision a VPN tunnel connection to a Region for private connectivity. Provision a second VPN tunnel for private connectivity and as a backup if the primary VPN connection fails.
C.
Provision an AWS Direct Connect connection to a Region. Provision a second Direct Connect connection to the same Region as a backup if the primary Direct Connect connection fails.
D.
Provision an AWS Direct Connect connection to a Region. Use the Direct Connect failover attribute from the AWS CLI to automatically create a backup connection if the primary Direct Connect connection fails.

Answer: A

Explanation:
Options B and C propose using multiple VPN connections for private connectivity and as backups. While VPNs can serve as backups, they may not provide the same level of consistent low latency and high availability as Direct Connect connections. Additionally, provisioning multiple VPN tunnels can increase operational complexity and costs.
Option D suggests using the Direct Connect failover attribute from the AWS CLI to automatically create a backup connection if the primary Direct Connect connection fails. While this approach can be automated, it does not provide the same level of immediate failover capabilities as having a separate backup connection in place.
Therefore, option A, provisioning an AWS Direct Connect connection to a Region and provisioning a VPN connection as a backup, is the most suitable solution that meets the company's requirements for connectivity, cost-effectiveness, and high availability.

Question 646
A solutions architect needs to copy files from an Amazon S3 bucket to an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file system and another S3 bucket. The files must be copied continuously. New files are added to the original S3 bucket consistently. The copied files should be overwritten only if the source file changes.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?
A.
Create an AWS DataSync location for both the destination S3 bucket and the EFS file system. Create a task for the destination S3 bucket and the EFS file system. Set the transfer mode to transfer only data that has changed.
B.
Create an AWS Lambda function. Mount the file system to the function. Set up an S3 event notification to invoke the function when files are created and changed in Amazon S3. Configure the function to copy files to the file system and the destination S3 bucket.
C.
Create an AWS DataSync location for both the destination S3 bucket and the EFS file system. Create a task for the destination S3 bucket and the EFS file system. Set the transfer mode to transfer all data.
D.
Launch an Amazon EC2 instance in the same VPC as the file system. Mount the file system. Create a script to routinely synchronize all objects that changed in the origin S3 bucket to the destination S3 bucket and the mounted file system.

Answer: A

Explanation:
Transfer only data that has changed – DataSync copies only the data and metadata that differs between the source and destination location.
Transfer all data – DataSync copies everything in the source to the destination without comparing differences between the locations.
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/configure-metadata.html
(B would work too but is more "operational overhead.")

Question 647
A company uses Amazon EC2 instances and stores data on Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes. The company must ensure that all data is encrypted at rest by using AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS). The company must be able to control rotation of the encryption keys.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?
A.
Create a customer managed key. Use the key to encrypt the EBS volumes.
B.
Use an AWS managed key to encrypt the EBS volumes. Use the key to configure automatic key rotation.
C.
Create an external KMS key with imported key material. Use the key to encrypt the EBS volumes.
D.
Use an AWS owned key to encrypt the EBS volumes.

Answer: A

Explanation:
"The company must be able to control rotation of the encryption keys."
BD does not allow company owned keys
C is too much operational overhead

Question 648
A company needs a solution to enforce data encryption at rest on Amazon EC2 instances. The solution must automatically identify noncompliant resources and enforce compliance policies on findings.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST administrative overhead?
A.
Use an IAM policy that allows users to create only encrypted Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes. Use AWS Config and AWS Systems Manager to automate the detection and remediation of unencrypted EBS volumes.
B.
Use AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) to manage access to encrypted Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes. Use AWS Lambda and Amazon EventBridge to automate the detection and remediation of unencrypted EBS volumes.
C.
Use Amazon Macie to detect unencrypted Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes. Use AWS Systems Manager Automation rules to automatically encrypt existing and new EBS volumes.
D.
Use Amazon inspector to detect unencrypted Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes. Use AWS Systems Manager Automation rules to automatically encrypt existing and new EBS volumes.

Answer: A

Explanation:
IAM Policy and AWS Config (Option A): By creating an IAM policy that allows users to create only encrypted EBS volumes, you proactively prevent the creation of unencrypted volumes. Using AWS Config, you can set up rules to detect noncompliant resources, and AWS Systems Manager Automation can be used for automated remediation. This approach provides a proactive and automated solution.

Question 649
A company is migrating its multi-tier on-premises application to AWS. The application consists of a single-node MySQL database and a multi-node web tier. The company must minimize changes to the application during the migration. The company wants to improve application resiliency after the migration.
Which combination of steps will meet these requirements? (Choose two.)
A.
Migrate the web tier to Amazon EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group behind an Application Load Balancer.
B.
Migrate the database to Amazon EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group behind a Network Load Balancer.
C.
Migrate the database to an Amazon RDS Multi-AZ deployment.
D.
Migrate the web tier to an AWS Lambda function.
E.
Migrate the database to an Amazon DynamoDB table.

Answer: AC

Explanation:
Web Tier Migration (Option A): Migrating the web tier to Amazon EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB) provides horizontal scalability, automatic scaling, and improved resiliency. Auto Scaling helps in managing and maintaining the desired number of EC2 instances based on demand, and the ALB distributes incoming traffic across multiple instances.
Database Migration to Amazon RDS Multi-AZ (Option C): Migrating the database to Amazon RDS in a Multi-AZ deployment provides high availability and automatic failover. In a Multi-AZ deployment, Amazon RDS maintains a standby replica in a different Availability Zone, and in the event of a failure, it automatically promotes the replica to the primary instance. This enhances the resiliency of the database.

Question 650
A company wants to migrate its web applications from on premises to AWS. The company is located close to the eu-central-1 Region. Because of regulations, the company cannot launch some of its applications in eu-central-1. The company wants to achieve single-digit millisecond latency.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Deploy the applications in eu-central-1. Extend the company’s VPC from eu-central-1 to an edge location in Amazon CloudFront.
B.
Deploy the applications in AWS Local Zones by extending the company's VPC from eu-central-1 to the chosen Local Zone.
C.
Deploy the applications in eu-central-1. Extend the company’s VPC from eu-central-1 to the regional edge caches in Amazon CloudFront.
D.
Deploy the applications in AWS Wavelength Zones by extending the company’s VPC from eu-central-1 to the chosen Wavelength Zone.

Answer: B

Explanation:
"AWS Local Zones are a type of AWS infrastructure deployment that place compute, storage, database, and other select services closer to large population, industry, and IT centers, enabling you to deliver applications that require single-digit millisecond latency to end-users."
A and C tell us to "deploy the applications in eu-central-1" which is exactly what we're not supposed to do.
AWS Wavelength zones are AWS deployments in CSP's networks, has nothing to do with this question.

Question 653
A company that uses AWS needs a solution to predict the resources needed for manufacturing processes each month. The solution must use historical values that are currently stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. The company has no machine learning (ML) experience and wants to use a managed service for the training and predictions.
Which combination of steps will meet these requirements? (Choose two.)
A.
Deploy an Amazon SageMaker model. Create a SageMaker endpoint for inference.
B.
Use Amazon SageMaker to train a model by using the historical data in the S3 bucket.
C.
Configure an AWS Lambda function with a function URL that uses Amazon SageMaker endpoints to create predictions based on the inputs.
D.
Configure an AWS Lambda function with a function URL that uses an Amazon Forecast predictor to create a prediction based on the inputs.
E.
Train an Amazon Forsecast predictor by using the historical data in the S3 bucket.

Answer: AB?BD?DE?

Explanation:
AB
Yes, exactly. Steps B and A together constitute a comprehensive solution:
- Step B involves using Amazon SageMaker to train a machine learning model using historical data stored in the S3 bucket.
- Step A involves deploying the trained model as a SageMaker endpoint, allowing for real-time inference on new data.
This combination leverages Amazon SageMaker's managed services for both training and inference, meeting the company's requirements efficiently.

BD
Training the Model with SageMaker (Option B):
Use Amazon SageMaker to train a machine learning model based on historical data. SageMaker simplifies the process of training, deploying, and managing machine learning models.
Creating Predictions with Amazon Forecast (Option D):
Use Amazon Forecast to create a predictor based on historical data. Forecast is designed for time-series forecasting, making it suitable for predicting resources needed for manufacturing processes each month.
Combining SageMaker for training and Amazon Forecast for predictions provides a comprehensive solution, and AWS Lambda can be used to integrate these services into your workflow.

DE
- The company has no machine learning (ML) experience
- The comapny wants to use a managed service
We could tempted to go for SageMaker that is the core AWS managed service for ML purposes .
But, but, if we consider this valuable information:
- A company that uses AWS needs a solution to predict the resources needed for manufacturing processes.
With a bit research, we will find out that AWS also hold time-series forecasting service based on machine learning (ML).
https://aws.amazon.com/forecast/?nc1=h_ls
So i understand options DE are the best answers enven thought this service is not mentionned anywhere in current SAA-C03 course version

Question 655
A company wants to standardize its Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume encryption strategy. The company also wants to minimize the cost and configuration effort required to operate the volume encryption check.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Write API calls to describe the EBS volumes and to confirm the EBS volumes are encrypted. Use Amazon EventBridge to schedule an AWS Lambda function to run the API calls.
B.
Write API calls to describe the EBS volumes and to confirm the EBS volumes are encrypted. Run the API calls on an AWS Fargate task.
C.
Create an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy that requires the use of tags on EBS volumes. Use AWS Cost Explorer to display resources that are not properly tagged. Encrypt the untagged resources manually.
D.
Create an AWS Config rule for Amazon EBS to evaluate if a volume is encrypted and to flag the volume if it is not encrypted.

Answer: D

Explanation:
AWS Config is a service that enables you to assess, audit, and evaluate the configurations of your AWS resources. It can check whether your resources comply with certain conditions (such as being encrypted), and it can flag or take action on resources that do not comply.

Question 656
A company is running a business-critical web application on Amazon EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer. The EC2 instances are in an Auto Scaling group. The application uses an Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL database that is deployed in a single Availability Zone. The company wants the application to be highly available with minimum downtime and minimum loss of data.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational effort?
A.
Place the EC2 instances in different AWS Regions. Use Amazon Route 53 health checks to redirect traffic. Use Aurora PostgreSQL Cross-Region Replication.
B.
Configure the Auto Scaling group to use multiple Availability Zones. Configure the database as Multi-AZ. Configure an Amazon RDS Proxy instance for the database.
C.
Configure the Auto Scaling group to use one Availability Zone. Generate hourly snapshots of the database. Recover the database from the snapshots in the event of a failure.
D.
Configure the Auto Scaling group to use multiple AWS Regions. Write the data from the application to Amazon S3. Use S3 Event Notifications to launch an AWS Lambda function to write the data to the database.

Answer: B

Explanation:
A. This approach provides geographic redundancy, it introduces additional complexity and operational effort, including managing replication, handling latency, and potentially higher data transfer costs.
C. While snapshots can be used for data backup and recovery, they do not provide real-time failover capabilities and can result in significant data loss if a failure occurs between snapshots.
D. While this approach offers some decoupling and scalability benefits, it adds complexity to the data flow and introduces additional overhead for data processing.
In comparison, option B provides a simpler and more streamlined solution by utilizing multiple AZs, Multi-AZ configuration for the database, and RDS Proxy for improved connection management. It ensures high availability, minimal downtime, and minimum loss of data with the least operational effort.

Question 657
A company regularly uploads GB-sized files to Amazon S3. After the company uploads the files, the company uses a fleet of Amazon EC2 Spot Instances to transcode the file format. The company needs to scale throughput when the company uploads data from the on-premises data center to Amazon S3 and when the company downloads data from Amazon S3 to the EC2 instances.
Which solutions will meet these requirements? (Choose two.)
A.
Use the S3 bucket access point instead of accessing the S3 bucket directly.
B.
Upload the files into multiple S3 buckets.
C.
Use S3 multipart uploads.
D.
Fetch multiple byte-ranges of an object in parallel.
E.
Add a random prefix to each object when uploading the files.

Answer: CD

Explanation:
C: Upload: Multipart clear, 
D: Download: You can fetch a byte-range from an object, transferring only the specified portion. You can use concurrent connections to Amazon S3 to fetch different byte ranges from within the same object. This helps you achieve higher aggregate throughput versus a single whole-object request.
A: S3 Access Points can be easily scaled, but are typically used to simplify data access for any AWS service or customer application that stores data in S3. 
E: Prefixes: You can increase your read or write performance by using parallelization. For example, if you create 10 prefixes in an Amazon S3 bucket to parallelize reads, you could scale your read performance to 55,000 read requests per second.
But wording in this answer is strange...

Question 658
A solutions architect is designing a shared storage solution for a web application that is deployed across multiple Availability Zones. The web application runs on Amazon EC2 instances that are in an Auto Scaling group. The company plans to make frequent changes to the content. The solution must have strong consistency in returning the new content as soon as the changes occur.
Which solutions meet these requirements? (Choose two.)
A.
Use AWS Storage Gateway Volume Gateway Internet Small Computer Systems Interface (iSCSI) block storage that is mounted to the individual EC2 instances.
B.
Create an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file system. Mount the EFS file system on the individual EC2 instances.
C.
Create a shared Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume. Mount the EBS volume on the individual EC2 instances.
D.
Use AWS DataSync to perform continuous synchronization of data between EC2 hosts in the Auto Scaling group.
E.
Create an Amazon S3 bucket to store the web content. Set the metadata for the Cache-Control header to no-cache. Use Amazon CloudFront to deliver the content.

Answer: BC?BE?

Explanation:
BC
Option A is out as storage gateway is suited for hybrid cloud use cases where on-premises workloads need access to AWS cloud storage

BE
Regarding storage, I'd go for EFS, although it never mentions the requirement for file storage.
Datasync can copy data between several storage types, including EFS, agents can be installed on EC2, but you cannot perform continuous synchronization of EC2 instances. Only storage.
Cloudfront can publish both passive (s3) and active content (EC2+EFS) but wording doesn't tell a thing about such a share. And if it's a passive site why do we even have 2 storage types...
I'd say, for me, the least bad solution seems to be B + E.

Question 659
A company is deploying an application in three AWS Regions using an Application Load Balancer. Amazon Route 53 will be used to distribute traffic between these Regions.
Which Route 53 configuration should a solutions architect use to provide the MOST high-performing experience?
A.
Create an A record with a latency policy.
B.
Create an A record with a geolocation policy.
C.
Create a CNAME record with a failover policy.
D.
Create a CNAME record with a geoproximity policy.

Answer: A

Explanation:
1. Given the chance >always use Alias over a Cname<
2. Latency-based routing is for user experience. (low latency)
Failover is for DR, Geolocation for local restrictions/rights/language/currency, and geo-proximity is a more complex, biased location-based routing, not part of the SA Associate exam.

AWS X-Ray collects data about requests that your application serves, and it helps you view, filter, and gain insights into that data to identify issues and opportunities for optimization.
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/zh_tw/prescriptive-guidance/latest/logging-monitoring-for-application-owners/x-ray.html

Question 663
A company needs to provide customers with secure access to its data. The company processes customer data and stores the results in an Amazon S3 bucket.
All the data is subject to strong regulations and security requirements. The data must be encrypted at rest. Each customer must be able to access only their data from their AWS account. Company employees must not be able to access the data.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Provision an AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) certificate for each customer. Encrypt the data client-side. In the private certificate policy, deny access to the certificate for all principals except an IAM role that the customer provides.
B.
Provision a separate AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key for each customer. Encrypt the data server-side. In the S3 bucket policy, deny decryption of data for all principals except an IAM role that the customer provides.
C.
Provision a separate AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key for each customer. Encrypt the data server-side. In each KMS key policy, deny decryption of data for all principals except an IAM role that the customer provides.
D.
Provision an AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) certificate for each customer. Encrypt the data client-side. In the public certificate policy, deny access to the certificate for all principals except an IAM role that the customer provides.

Answer: B?C?

Explanation:
B
Server-Side Encryption: Encrypting data server-side with KMS ensures encryption happens transparently within AWS, eliminating the need for complex client-side management and potential security risks associated with user-managed keys.
Customer-Specific Keys: Utilizing separate KMS keys for each customer provides granular access control and encryption isolation. Each customer can only decrypt their data using their specific KMS key.
S3 Bucket Policy: By denying decryption permissions for all principals except the dedicated customer IAM role in the S3 bucket policy, unauthorized access, even from company employees, is prevented. This aligns with the requirement of customer-specific data access.

C
Option A is incorrect because using ACM certificates is typically for establishing secure communication over HTTPS and doesn't directly relate to encrypting data at rest in S3.
Option B is incorrect because while it suggests using AWS KMS keys for encryption, it mentions using S3 bucket policies for access control, which would not be appropriate for controlling decryption permissions.
Option D is incorrect because it suggests using ACM certificates for client-side encryption, which is not typically used for encrypting data at rest in S3, and the approach described would not effectively control access to the encrypted data.

Question 664
A solutions architect creates a VPC that includes two public subnets and two private subnets. A corporate security mandate requires the solutions architect to launch all Amazon EC2 instances in a private subnet. However, when the solutions architect launches an EC2 instance that runs a web server on ports 80 and 443 in a private subnet, no external internet traffic can connect to the server.
What should the solutions architect do to resolve this issue?
A.
Attach the EC2 instance to an Auto Scaling group in a private subnet. Ensure that the DNS record for the website resolves to the Auto Scaling group identifier.
B.
Provision an internet-facing Application Load Balancer (ALB) in a public subnet. Add the EC2 instance to the target group that is associated with the ALEnsure that the DNS record for the website resolves to the ALB.
C.
Launch a NAT gateway in a private subnet. Update the route table for the private subnets to add a default route to the NAT gateway. Attach a public Elastic IP address to the NAT gateway.
D.
Ensure that the security group that is attached to the EC2 instance allows HTTP traffic on port 80 and HTTPS traffic on port 443. Ensure that the DNS record for the website resolves to the public IP address of the EC2 instance.

Answer: B

Explanation:
Not A - Autoscaling Irrelevant
B - ALB, route tales for the public subnet with a route to Priv subnet
C - "NAT gateway" is "to allow [outbound] internet traffic", but this is about inbound traffic 
D - Instances are in the private subnet, therefore it wont work from the public.

Question 665
A company is deploying a new application to Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) with an AWS Fargate cluster. The application needs a storage solution for data persistence. The solution must be highly available and fault tolerant. The solution also must be shared between multiple application containers.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?
A.

Answer: B

Explanation:
Overall, Amazon EFS provides a highly available, fault-tolerant, and shared storage solution with minimal operational overhead, making it the ideal choice for persisting data in an Amazon EKS Fargate cluster.

Question 666
A company has an application that uses Docker containers in its local data center. The application runs on a container host that stores persistent data in a volume on the host. The container instances use the stored persistent data.
The company wants to move the application to a fully managed service because the company does not want to manage any servers or storage infrastructure.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Use Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) with self-managed nodes. Create an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume attached to an Amazon EC2 instance. Use the EBS volume as a persistent volume mounted in the containers.
B.
Use Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) with an AWS Fargate launch type. Create an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) volume. Add the EFS volume as a persistent storage volume mounted in the containers.
C.
Use Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) with an AWS Fargate launch type. Create an Amazon S3 bucket. Map the S3 bucket as a persistent storage volume mounted in the containers.
D.
Use Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) with an Amazon EC2 launch type. Create an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) volume. Add the EFS volume as a persistent storage volume mounted in the containers.

Answer: B

Explanation:
Mounting S3 in Fargate is not supported commonly. You'd have to make it manually. EFS is very well supported with Fargate.

Question 667
A company has an application that ingests incoming messages. Dozens of other applications and microservices then quickly consume these messages. The number of messages varies drastically and sometimes increases suddenly to 100,000 each second. The company wants to decouple the solution and increase scalability.
Which solution meets these requirements?
A.
Persist the messages to Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics. Configure the consumer applications to read and process the messages.
B.
Deploy the ingestion application on Amazon EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group to scale the number of EC2 instances based on CPU metrics.
C.
Write the messages to Amazon Kinesis Data Streams with a single shard. Use an AWS Lambda function to preprocess messages and store them in Amazon DynamoDB. Configure the consumer applications to read from DynamoDB to process the messages.
D.
Publish the messages to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic with multiple Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SOS) subscriptions. Configure the consumer applications to process the messages from the queues.

Answer: D

Explanation:
Option A: It is more suitable for real-time analytics and processing of streaming data rather than decoupling and scaling message ingestion and consumption.
Option B: It may help with scalability to some extent, but it doesn't provide decoupling.
Option C: It is a valid option, but it lacks the decoupling aspect. In this approach, the consumer applications would still need to read directly from DynamoDB, creating tight coupling between the ingestion and consumption processes.
Option D: It is the recommended solution for decoupling and scalability. The ingestion application can publish messages to an SNS topic, and multiple consumer apps can subscribe to the relevant SQS queues. SNS ensures that each message is delivered to all subscribed queues, allowing the consuming apps to independently process the messages at their own pace and scale horizontally as needed. This provides loose coupling, scalability, and fault tolerance, as the queues can handle message spikes and manage the consumption rate based on the consumer's processing capabilities.

Question 668
A company's HTTP application is behind a Network Load Balancer (NLB). The NLB's target group is configured to use an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group with multiple EC2 instances that run the web service.
The company notices that the NLB is not detecting HTTP errors for the application. These errors require a manual restart of the EC2 instances that run the web service. The company needs to improve the application's availability without writing custom scripts or code.
What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements?
A.
Enable HTTP health checks on the NLB, supplying the URL of the company's application.
B.
Add a cron job to the EC2 instances to check the local application's logs once each minute. If HTTP errors are detected. the application will restart.
C.
Replace the NLB with an Application Load Balancer. Enable HTTP health checks by supplying the URL of the company's application. Configure an Auto Scaling action to replace unhealthy instances.
D.
Create an Amazon Cloud Watch alarm that monitors the UnhealthyHostCount metric for the NLB. Configure an Auto Scaling action to replace unhealthy instances when the alarm is in the ALARM state.

Answer: C

Explanation:
A. NLB, but NLB's health checks are designed for TCP/UDP protocols and lack the advanced features specific to HTTP applications provided by ALB.
B. This approach involves custom scripting and manual intervention, which contradicts the requirement of not writing custom scripts or code.
D. Since the NLB does not detect HTTP errors, relying solely on the UnhealthyHostCount metric may not accurately capture the health of the application instances.
Therefore, C is the recommended choice for improving the application's availability without custom scripting or code. By replacing the NLB with an ALB, enabling HTTP health checks, and configuring Auto Scaling to replace unhealthy instances, the company can ensure that only healthy instances are serving traffic, enhancing the application's availability automatically.

Question 669

Question 670
A city has deployed a web application running on Amazon EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB). The application's users have reported sporadic performance, which appears to be related to DDoS attacks originating from random IP addresses. The city needs a solution that requires minimal configuration changes and provides an audit trail for the DDoS sources.
Which solution meets these requirements?
A.
Enable an AWS WAF web ACL on the ALB, and configure rules to block traffic from unknown sources.
B.
Subscribe to Amazon Inspector. Engage the AWS DDoS Response Team (DRT) to integrate mitigating controls into the service.
C.
Subscribe to AWS Shield Advanced. Engage the AWS DDoS Response Team (DRT) to integrate mitigating controls into the service.
D.
Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution for the application, and set the ALB as the origin. Enable an AWS WAF web ACL on the distribution, and configure rules to block traffic from unknown sources

Answer: C

Explanation:
(A & D) are incorrect.
AWS WAF Web ACL - contain WAF rules that define how to inspect web requests and what to do when a web request matches the inspection criteria.
We don't have the inspection criteria necessary to use WAF Web ACL effectively bc DDoS attacks are originating from random IP addresses. 
The AWS DDoS Response Team can respond to the randomness. 
(B) is incorrect. 
Amazon Inspector - a service that analyzes your EC2 instances to identify potential security and configuration issues. 
Inspector is not good at dealing with an actual DDOS attack like AWS Shield Advanced.

D.
Create an Amazon FSx for Lustre file system. Import the data directly into the FSx for Lustre file system. Access the FSx for Lustre file system from the HPC cluster instances.

Answer: B?D?

Explanation:
B
No direct integration between Snowball and Fsx for Lustre. It must be via S3.
Snowball Edge (Storage Optimized) --> S3 --integrate--> FSx for Lustre
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/LustreGuide/create-dra-linked-data-repo.html
https://aws.amazon.com/tw/blogs/aws/enhanced-amazon-s3-integration-for-amazon-fsx-for-lustre/

D
Option A, B, and C involve using Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS as an intermediary storage layer, which may introduce additional latency and overhead, not meeting the requirement of consistent sub-millisecond latency. Therefore, Option D is the most suitable solution for this scenario.

Question 674
A company runs a three-tier application in a VPC. The database tier uses an Amazon RDS for MySQL DB instance.
The company plans to migrate the RDS for MySQL DB instance to an Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster. The company needs a solution that replicates the data changes that happen during the migration to the new database.
Which combination of steps will meet these requirements? (Choose two.)
A.
Use AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) Schema Conversion to transform the database objects.
B.
Use AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) Schema Conversion to create an Aurora PostgreSQL read replica on the RDS for MySQL DB instance.
C.
Configure an Aurora MySQL read replica for the RDS for MySQL DB instance.
D.
Define an AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) task with change data capture (CDC) to migrate the data.
E.
Promote the Aurora PostgreSQL read replica to a standalone Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster when the replica lag is zero.

Answer: AD

Explanation:
A: Correct. because need convert from MySQL to PostgreSQL
B: Wrong. Schema Conversion does not create an Aurora read replica
C: Wrong. Company wants to migrate to Aurora PostgreSQL, not Aurora MySQL
D: Correct. CDC task helps to capture ongoing change from source data store
E: Wrong. Although using Aurora Read Replica is an option for DB migration within the same Region, this question is asking for "combination of steps", which this option does not have another compatible option to pair with
Therefore, answer is "AD"

B.
Enable ALB access logging to Amazon S3. Create a table in Amazon Athena, and query the logs.
C.
Enable ALB access logging to Amazon S3. Open each file in a text editor, and search each line for the relevant information.
D.
Use Amazon EMR on a dedicated Amazon EC2 instance to directly query the ALB to acquire traffic access log information.

Answer: B

Explanation:
A - Cloudtrail is for API Calls and changes on AWS account. 
B - Going for athena in S3. - Correct
C - Manual work 
D - Distractor

Question 677
A company wants to use NAT gateways in its AWS environment. The company's Amazon EC2 instances in private subnets must be able to connect to the public internet through the NAT gateways.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Create public NAT gateways in the same private subnets as the EC2 instances.
B.
Create private NAT gateways in the same private subnets as the EC2 instances.
C.
Create public NAT gateways in public subnets in the same VPCs as the EC2 instances.
D.
Create private NAT gateways in public subnets in the same VPCs as the EC2 instances.

Answer: C

Explanation:
I think the correct is C, because D would require more than just private NAT gateway.
Private – Instances in private subnets can connect to other VPCs or your on-premises network through a private NAT gateway. You can route traffic from the NAT gateway through a transit gateway or a virtual private gateway. You cannot associate an elastic IP address with a private NAT gateway. You can attach an internet gateway to a VPC with a private NAT gateway, but if you route traffic from the private NAT gateway to the internet gateway, the internet gateway drops the traffic.
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat-gateway.html

Question 678
A company has an organization in AWS Organizations. The company runs Amazon EC2 instances across four AWS accounts in the root organizational unit (OU). There are three nonproduction accounts and one production account. The company wants to prohibit users from launching EC2 instances of a certain size in the nonproduction accounts. The company has created a service control policy (SCP) to deny access to launch instances that use the prohibited types.
Which solutions to deploy the SCP will meet these requirements? (Choose two.)
A.
Attach the SCP to the root OU for the organization.
B.
Attach the SCP to the three nonproduction Organizations member accounts.
C.
Attach the SCP to the Organizations management account.
D.
Create an OU for the production account. Attach the SCP to the OU. Move the production member account into the new OU.
E.
Create an OU for the required accounts. Attach the SCP to the OU. Move the nonproduction member accounts into the new OU.

Answer: BE?

Explanation:
B - Attach the SPC to the three accounts
E - Creates an OU > moves the member accounts to OU > attach the SCP to OU
"If you apply an authorization policy (for example, a service control policy (SCP)), to the 
root, it applies to all organizational units (OUs) and member accounts in the organization."
"A" would also affect the one production account, which we clearly don't want. 
You can "attach an SCP to a root, OU, or account"

Question 679
A company runs a shopping application that uses Amazon DynamoDB to store customer information. In case of data corruption, a solutions architect needs to design a solution that meets a recovery point objective (RPO) of 15 minutes and a recovery time objective (RTO) of 1 hour.
What should the solutions architect recommend to meet these requirements?
A.
Configure DynamoDB global tables. For RPO recovery, point the application to a different AWS Region.
B.
Configure DynamoDB point-in-time recovery. For RPO recovery, restore to the desired point in time.
C.
Export the DynamoDB data to Amazon S3 Glacier on a daily basis. For RPO recovery, import the data from S3 Glacier to DynamoDB.
D.
Schedule Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) snapshots for the DynamoDB table every 15 minutes. For RPO recovery, restore the DynamoDB table by using the EBS snapshot.

Answer: B

Explanation:
A. Global tables provide multi-region replication for disaster recovery purposes, they may not meet the desired RPO of 15 minutes without additional configuration and potential data loss.
C. Exporting and importing data on a daily basis does not align with the desired RPO of 15 minutes.
D. EBS snapshots can be used for data backup, they are not directly applicable to DynamoDB and cannot provide the desired RPO and RTO without custom implementation.
In comparison, option B utilizing DynamoDB's built-in point-in-time recovery functionality provides the most straightforward and effective solution for meeting the specified RPO of 15 minutes and RTO of 1 hour. By enabling PITR and restoring the table to the desired point in time, the company can recover the customer information with minimal data loss and within the required time frame.

Question 680
A company’s website hosted on Amazon EC2 instances processes classified data stored in Amazon S3. Due to security concerns, the company requires a private and secure connection between its EC2 resources and Amazon S3.
Which solution meets these requirements?
A.
Set up S3 bucket policies to allow access from a VPC endpoint.
B.
Set up an IAM policy to grant read-write access to the S3 bucket.
C.
Set up a NAT gateway to access resources outside the private subnet.
D.
Set up an access key ID and a secret access key to access the S3 bucket.

Answer: A

Explanation:
I think this question asks about the connection not about authorization, and for a secure S3 connection (e.g. without internet exposure, etc. ) should be a VPC endpoint.

Question 681
An ecommerce company runs its application on AWS. The application uses an Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL cluster in Multi-AZ mode for the underlying database. During a recent promotional campaign, the application experienced heavy read load and write load. Users experienced timeout issues when they attempted to access the application.
A solutions architect needs to make the application architecture more scalable and highly available.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST downtime?
A.
Create an Amazon EventBridge rule that has the Aurora cluster as a source. Create an AWS Lambda function to log the state change events of the Aurora cluster. Add the Lambda function as a target for the EventBridge rule. Add additional reader nodes to fail over to.
B.
Modify the Aurora cluster and activate the zero-downtime restart (ZDR) feature. Use Database Activity Streams on the cluster to track the cluster status.
C.
Add additional reader instances to the Aurora cluster. Create an Amazon RDS Proxy target group for the Aurora cluster.
D.
Create an Amazon ElastiCache for Redis cache. Replicate data from the Aurora cluster to Redis by using AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) with a write-around approach.

Answer: C

Explanation:
A - "Lambda function to log state changes" - doesn't help with read/write load.
B - ZDR applies to restarts that Aurora performs automatically to resolve error conditions: doesn't help with read/write load.
D - Write-around approach: data is always written to the database and the data that is read goes to the cache. Doesn't help with read/write load.
C - CORRECT. Even though it doesn't address "write operations", Aurora Replicas to offload read workloads from the primary DB instance. Amazon RDS Proxy allows applications to pool and share connections established with the database, improving database efficiency and application scalability.

Question 682
A company is designing a web application on AWS. The application will use a VPN connection between the company’s existing data centers and the company's VPCs.
The company uses Amazon Route 53 as its DNS service. The application must use private DNS records to communicate with the on-premises services from a VPC.
Which solution will meet these requirements in the MOST secure manner?
A.
Create a Route 53 Resolver outbound endpoint. Create a resolver rule. Associate the resolver rule with the VPC.
B.
Create a Route 53 Resolver inbound endpoint. Create a resolver rule. Associate the resolver rule with the VPC.
C.
Create a Route 53 private hosted zone. Associate the private hosted zone with the VPC.
D.
Create a Route 53 public hosted zone. Create a record for each service to allow service communication

Answer: A

Explanation:
If you have workloads that leverage both VPCs and on-premises resources, you also need to resolve DNS records hosted on-premises. Similarly, these on-premises resources may need to resolve names hosted on AWS. Through Resolver endpoints and conditional forwarding rules, you can resolve DNS queries between your on-premises resources and VPCs to create a hybrid cloud setup over VPN or Direct Connect (DX). Specifically:
Inbound Resolver endpoints allow DNS queries to your VPC from your on-premises network or another VPC.
Outbound Resolver endpoints allow DNS queries from your VPC to your on-premises network or another VPC.
Reference: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resolver.html

Question 683
A company is running a photo hosting service in the us-east-1 Region. The service enables users across multiple countries to upload and view photos. Some photos are heavily viewed for months, and others are viewed for less than a week. The application allows uploads of up to 20 MB for each photo. The service uses the photo metadata to determine which photos to display to each user.
Which solution provides the appropriate user access MOST cost-effectively?
A.
Store the photos in Amazon DynamoDB. Turn on DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) to cache frequently viewed items.
B.
Store the photos in the Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class. Store the photo metadata and its S3 location in DynamoDB.
C.
Store the photos in the Amazon S3 Standard storage class. Set up an S3 Lifecycle policy to move photos older than 30 days to the S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) storage class. Use the object tags to keep track of metadata.
D.
Store the photos in the Amazon S3 Glacier storage class. Set up an S3 Lifecycle policy to move photos older than 30 days to the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class. Store the photo metadata and its S3 location in Amazon OpenSearch Service.

Answer: B

Explanation:
The Intelligent-Tiering storage class automatically moves objects between two access tiers (frequent access and infrequent access) based on their access patterns, which aligns well with the varying view frequencies of the photos. Storing metadata in DynamoDB allows for efficient querying and retrieval of photo metadata.


Question 684
A company runs a highly available web application on Amazon EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer. The company uses Amazon CloudWatch metrics.
As the traffic to the web application increases, some EC2 instances become overloaded with many outstanding requests. The CloudWatch metrics show that the number of requests processed and the time to receive the responses from some EC2 instances are both higher compared to other EC2 instances. The company does not want new requests to be forwarded to the EC2 instances that are already overloaded.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Use the round robin routing algorithm based on the RequestCountPerTarget and ActiveConnectionCount CloudWatch metrics.
B.
Use the least outstanding requests algorithm based on the RequestCountPerTarget and ActiveConnectionCount CloudWatch metrics.
C.
Use the round robin routing algorithm based on the RequestCount and TargetResponseTime CloudWatch metrics.
D.
Use the least outstanding requests algorithm based on the RequestCount and TargetResponseTime CloudWatch metrics.

Answer: B?D?

Explanation:
B
Option B is correct because can use "RequestCountPerTarget" to identify the amount of requests for each EC2 instance. Then use "least outstanding requests algorithm" to route to targets with the lowest number of in progress requests.
Option D is wrong because "RequestCount" cannot identify the amount of requests for each EC2 instance. "RequestCount" is for the whole ALB.

D
This is from an earlier version of the AWS documentation on ALB target groups - for some reason they removed this information in the current revision:
"Consider using least outstanding requests when the requests for your application vary in complexity or your targets vary in processing capability. Round robin is a good choice when the requests and targets are similar, or if you need to distribute requests equally among targets. You can compare the effect of round robin versus least outstanding requests using the following CloudWatch metrics: RequestCount, TargetConnectionErrorCount, and TargetResponseTime."

A company uses Amazon EC2, AWS Fargate, and AWS Lambda to run multiple workloads in the company's AWS account. The company wants to fully make use of its Compute Savings Plans. The company wants to receive notification when coverage of the Compute Savings Plans drops.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the MOST operational efficiency?
A.
Create a daily budget for the Savings Plans by using AWS Budgets. Configure the budget with a coverage threshold to send notifications to the appropriate email message recipients.
B.
Create a Lambda function that runs a coverage report against the Savings Plans. Use Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES) to email the report to the appropriate email message recipients.
C.
Create an AWS Budgets report for the Savings Plans budget. Set the frequency to daily.
D.
Create a Savings Plans alert subscription. Enable all notification options. Enter an email address to receive notifications.

Answer: A?D?

Explanation:
A
A - describes exactly what is said in this link:

Question 686
A company runs a real-time data ingestion solution on AWS. The solution consists of the most recent version of Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (Amazon MSK). The solution is deployed in a VPC in private subnets across three Availability Zones.
A solutions architect needs to redesign the data ingestion solution to be publicly available over the internet. The data in transit must also be encrypted.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the MOST operational efficiency?
A.
Configure public subnets in the existing VPC. Deploy an MSK cluster in the public subnets. Update the MSK cluster security settings to enable mutual TLS authentication.
B.
Create a new VPC that has public subnets. Deploy an MSK cluster in the public subnets. Update the MSK cluster security settings to enable mutual TLS authentication.
C.
Deploy an Application Load Balancer (ALB) that uses private subnets. Configure an ALB security group inbound rule to allow inbound traffic from the VPC CIDR block for HTTPS protocol.
D.
Deploy a Network Load Balancer (NLB) that uses private subnets. Configure an NLB listener for HTTPS communication over the internet.

Answer: A

Explanation:
"You can turn on public access to an MSK cluster at no additional cost... 
To turn on public access to a cluster, first ensure that the cluster meets all of the following conditions:
- The subnets that are associated with the cluster must be public.
- Unauthenticated access control must be off and at least one of the following access-control methods must be on: SASL/IAM, SASL/SCRAM, mTLS.
- ..."

Question 687
A company wants to migrate an on-premises legacy application to AWS. The application ingests customer order files from an on-premises enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. The application then uploads the files to an SFTP server. The application uses a scheduled job that checks for order files every hour.
The company already has an AWS account that has connectivity to the on-premises network. The new application on AWS must support integration with the existing ERP system. The new application must be secure and resilient and must use the SFTP protocol to process orders from the ERP system immediately.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Create an AWS Transfer Family SFTP internet-facing server in two Availability Zones. Use Amazon S3 storage. Create an AWS Lambda function to process order files. Use S3 Event Notifications to send s3:ObjectCreated:* events to the Lambda function.
B.
Create an AWS Transfer Family SFTP internet-facing server in one Availability Zone. Use Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) storage. Create an AWS Lambda function to process order files. Use a Transfer Family managed workflow to invoke the Lambda function.
C.
Create an AWS Transfer Family SFTP internal server in two Availability Zones. Use Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) storage. Create an AWS Step Functions state machine to process order files. Use Amazon EventBridge Scheduler to invoke the state machine to periodically check Amazon EFS for order files.
D.
Create an AWS Transfer Family SFTP internal server in two Availability Zones. Use Amazon S3 storage. Create an AWS Lambda function to process order files. Use a Transfer Family managed workflow to invoke the Lambda function.

Answer: D

Explanation:
A and B is out since it is public facing and we don't need public facing SFTP since Company already have Connection to AWS thro ON-PREMISES. 
Initially i thought it will C since it was doing scheduled as they were doing scheduled job every hour on on-premises. Then the read thro question and saw they are saying with new solution, they want to process the file immediately after it is uploaded so D is correct since it will trigger the Lambda file as soon as file appears on S3.

Question 688
A company’s applications use Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark to process data on premises. The existing infrastructure is not scalable and is complex to manage.
A solutions architect must design a scalable solution that reduces operational complexity. The solution must keep the data processing on premises.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Use AWS Site-to-Site VPN to access the on-premises Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) data and application. Use an Amazon EMR cluster to process the data.
B.
Use AWS DataSync to connect to the on-premises Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) cluster. Create an Amazon EMR cluster to process the data.
C.
Migrate the Apache Hadoop application and the Apache Spark application to Amazon EMR clusters on AWS Outposts. Use the EMR clusters to process the data.
D.
Use an AWS Snowball device to migrate the data to an Amazon S3 bucket. Create an Amazon EMR cluster to process the data.

Answer: C

Explanation:

Question 689
A company is migrating a large amount of data from on-premises storage to AWS. Windows, Mac, and Linux based Amazon EC2 instances in the same AWS Region will access the data by using SMB and NFS storage protocols. The company will access a portion of the data routinely. The company will access the remaining data infrequently.
The company needs to design a solution to host the data.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?
A.
Create an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) volume that uses EFS Intelligent-Tiering. Use AWS DataSync to migrate the data to the EFS volume.
B.
Create an Amazon FSx for ONTAP instance. Create an FSx for ONTAP file system with a root volume that uses the auto tiering policy. Migrate the data to the FSx for ONTAP volume.
C.
Create an Amazon S3 bucket that uses S3 Intelligent-Tiering. Migrate the data to the S3 bucket by using an AWS Storage Gateway Amazon S3 File Gateway.
D.
Create an Amazon FSx for OpenZFS file system. Migrate the data to the new volume.

Answer: B

Explanation:
Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP provides fully managed shared storage in the AWS Cloud with the popular data access and management capabilities of ONTAP.
Move workloads running on NetApp or other NFS/SMB/iSCSI servers to AWS without modifying application code or how you manage data.
And FsX for NetAPP ONTAP support "Reducing storage costs with automatic and intelligent storage tiering."

Question 690
A company runs a photo processing application that needs to frequently upload and download pictures from Amazon S3 buckets that are located in the same AWS Region. A solutions architect has noticed an increased cost in data transfer fees and needs to implement a solution to reduce these costs.
How can the solutions architect meet this requirement?
A.
Deploy Amazon API Gateway into a public subnet and adjust the route table to route S3 calls through it.
B.
Deploy a NAT gateway into a public subnet and attach an endpoint policy that allows access to the S3 buckets.
C.
Deploy the application into a public subnet and allow it to route through an internet gateway to access the S3 buckets.
D.
Deploy an S3 VPC gateway endpoint into the VPC and attach an endpoint policy that allows access to the S3 buckets.

Answer: D

Explanation:
By deploying an S3 VPC gateway endpoint, the application can access the S3 buckets over a private network connection within the VPC, eliminating the need for data transfer over the internet. This can help reduce data transfer fees as well as improve the performance of the application. The endpoint policy can be used to specify which S3 buckets the application has access to.

***WRONG***
Option A, deploying Amazon API Gateway into a public subnet and adjusting the route table, would not address the issue of data transfer fees as the application would still be transferring data over the internet. 
Option B, deploying a NAT gateway into a public subnet and attaching an endpoint policy, would not address the issue of data transfer fees either as the NAT gateway is used to enable outbound internet access for instances in a private subnet, rather than for connecting to S3. 
Option C, deploying the application into a public subnet and allowing it to route through an internet gateway, would not reduce data transfer fees as the application would still be transferring data over the internet.

Question 691
A manufacturing company runs its report generation application on AWS. The application generates each report in about 20 minutes. The application is built as a monolith that runs on a single Amazon EC2 instance. The application requires frequent updates to its tightly coupled modules. The application becomes complex to maintain as the company adds new features.
Each time the company patches a software module, the application experiences downtime. Report generation must restart from the beginning after any interruptions. The company wants to redesign the application so that the application can be flexible, scalable, and gradually improved. The company wants to minimize application downtime.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Run the application on AWS Lambda as a single function with maximum provisioned concurrency.
B.
Run the application on Amazon EC2 Spot Instances as microservices with a Spot Fleet default allocation strategy.
C.
Run the application on Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) as microservices with service auto scaling.
D.
Run the application on AWS Elastic Beanstalk as a single application environment with an all-at-once deployment strategy.

Answer: C

Explanation:

Question 692
A company wants to rearchitect a large-scale web application to a serverless microservices architecture. The application uses Amazon EC2 instances and is written in Python.
The company selected one component of the web application to test as a microservice. The component supports hundreds of requests each second. The company wants to create and test the microservice on an AWS solution that supports Python. The solution must also scale automatically and require minimal infrastructure and minimal operational support.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Use a Spot Fleet with auto scaling of EC2 instances that run the most recent Amazon Linux operating system.
B.
Use an AWS Elastic Beanstalk web server environment that has high availability configured.
C.
Use Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS). Launch Auto Scaling groups of self-managed EC2 instances.
D.
Use an AWS Lambda function that runs custom developed code.

Answer: D

Explanation:
A: auto-scaling of EC2 instances - Lot of overhead + Infra
B: The company selected one component of the web application to test as a microservice. The component supports hundreds of requests each second. > lastic Beanstalk is a bad choice if you need worker processes. The whole point of a worker process is to perform a task in the background without slowing down your main web app. But Elastic Beanstalk doesn't support this option in a scalable way.
Also, they want to test just 1 selected microservice and I think it's a bit of overkill to do it using Elastic Beanstalk. Happy to be challenged though!
C: self-managed EC2 instances > infra + operational overhead
D: Lambda supports Python, microservice should be quicker than 15 mins, worst case scenario the test will fail.. (that's the purpose tests are conducted for anyway..)

Question 693
A company has an AWS Direct Connect connection from its on-premises location to an AWS account. The AWS account has 30 different VPCs in the same AWS Region. The VPCs use private virtual interfaces (VIFs). Each VPC has a CIDR block that does not overlap with other networks under the company's control.
The company wants to centrally manage the networking architecture while still allowing each VPC to communicate with all other VPCs and on-premises networks.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST amount of operational overhead?
A.
Create a transit gateway, and associate the Direct Connect connection with a new transit VIF. Turn on the transit gateway's route propagation feature.
B.
Create a Direct Connect gateway. Recreate the private VIFs to use the new gateway. Associate each VPC by creating new virtual private gateways.
C.
Create a transit VPConnect the Direct Connect connection to the transit VPCreate a peering connection between all other VPCs in the Region. Update the route tables.
D.
Create AWS Site-to-Site VPN connections from on premises to each VPC. Ensure that both VPN tunnels are UP for each connection. Turn on the route propagation feature.

Answer: A

Explanation:
"You can use AWS Direct Connect gateway to connect your Direct Connect connection over a transit virtual interface to the VPCs or VPNs that are attached to your transit gateway. You associate a Direct Connect gateway with the transit gateway. Then, create a transit virtual interface for your AWS Direct Connect connection to the Direct Connect gateway."

Question 694
A company has applications that run on Amazon EC2 instances. The EC2 instances connect to Amazon RDS databases by using an IAM role that has associated policies. The company wants to use AWS Systems Manager to patch the EC2 instances without disrupting the running applications.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Create a new IAM role. Attach the AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore policy to the new IAM role. Attach the new IAM role to the EC2 instances and the existing IAM role.
B.
Create an IAM user. Attach the AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore policy to the IAM user. Configure Systems Manager to use the IAM user to manage the EC2 instances.
C.
Enable Default Host Configuration Management in Systems Manager to manage the EC2 instances.
D.
Remove the existing policies from the existing IAM role. Add the AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore policy to the existing IAM role.

Answer: C

Explanation:
"The Default Host Management Configuration setting allows AWS Systems Manager to manage your Amazon EC2 instances automatically as managed instances.
Default Host Management Configuration makes it possible to manage EC2 instances without your having to manually create an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) instance profile. Instead, Default Host Management Configuration creates and applies a default IAM role to ensure that Systems Manager has permissions to manage all instances in the AWS account and AWS Region where it's activated."

Question 695
A company runs container applications by using Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) and the Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler. The workload is not consistent throughout the day. A solutions architect notices that the number of nodes does not automatically scale out when the existing nodes have reached maximum capacity in the cluster, which causes performance issues.
Which solution will resolve this issue with the LEAST administrative overhead?
A.
Scale out the nodes by tracking the memory usage.
B.
Use the Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler to manage the number of nodes in the cluster.
C.
Use an AWS Lambda function to resize the EKS cluster automatically.
D.
Use an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group to distribute the workload.

Answer: B

Question 696
A company maintains about 300 TB in Amazon S3 Standard storage month after month. The S3 objects are each typically around 50 GB in size and are frequently replaced with multipart uploads by their global application. The number and size of S3 objects remain constant, but the company's S3 storage costs are increasing each month.
How should a solutions architect reduce costs in this situation?
A.
Switch from multipart uploads to Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration.
B.
Enable an S3 Lifecycle policy that deletes incomplete multipart uploads.
C.
Configure S3 inventory to prevent objects from being archived too quickly.
D.
Configure Amazon CloudFront to reduce the number of objects stored in Amazon S3.

Answer: B

Explanation:
Optimize multipart uploads to reduce costs associated with storing incomplete multipart upload parts. Ensure that multipart uploads are completed and the parts are assembled into complete objects in a timely manner to avoid unnecessary storage costs.

Question 697
A company has deployed a multiplayer game for mobile devices. The game requires live location tracking of players based on latitude and longitude. The data store for the game must support rapid updates and retrieval of locations.
The game uses an Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance with read replicas to store the location data. During peak usage periods, the database is unable to maintain the performance that is needed for reading and writing updates. The game's user base is increasing rapidly.
What should a solutions architect do to improve the performance of the data tier?
A.
Take a snapshot of the existing DB instance. Restore the snapshot with Multi-AZ enabled.
B.
Migrate from Amazon RDS to Amazon OpenSearch Service with OpenSearch Dashboards.
C.
Deploy Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) in front of the existing DB instance. Modify the game to use DAX.
D.
Deploy an Amazon ElastiCache for Redis cluster in front of the existing DB instance. Modify the game to use Redis.

Answer: D

Explanation:
ElastiCache is a fully managed, in-memory caching service that provides microsecond read and write latencies that support flexible, real-time use cases.

Question 698
A company stores critical data in Amazon DynamoDB tables in the company's AWS account. An IT administrator accidentally deleted a DynamoDB table. The deletion caused a significant loss of data and disrupted the company's operations. The company wants to prevent this type of disruption in the future.
Which solution will meet this requirement with the LEAST operational overhead?
A.
Configure a trail in AWS CloudTrail. Create an Amazon EventBridge rule for delete actions. Create an AWS Lambda function to automatically restore deleted DynamoDB tables.
B.
Create a backup and restore plan for the DynamoDB tables. Recover the DynamoDB tables manually.
C.
Configure deletion protection on the DynamoDB tables.
D.
Enable point-in-time recovery on the DynamoDB tables.

Answer: C

Explanation:
https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/03/amazon-dynamodb-table-deletion-protection/
Deletion protection is now available for Amazon DynamoDB tables in all AWS Regions. DynamoDB now makes it possible for you to protect your tables from accidental deletion when performing regular table management operations. When creating new tables or managing existing tables, authorized administrators can set the deletion protection property for each table, which will govern whether a table can be deleted.

Question 699
A company has an on-premises data center that is running out of storage capacity. The company wants to migrate its storage infrastructure to AWS while minimizing bandwidth costs. The solution must allow for immediate retrieval of data at no additional cost.
How can these requirements be met?
A.
Deploy Amazon S3 Glacier Vault and enable expedited retrieval. Enable provisioned retrieval capacity for the workload.
B.
Deploy AWS Storage Gateway using cached volumes. Use Storage Gateway to store data in Amazon S3 while retaining copies of frequently accessed data subsets locally.
C.
Deploy AWS Storage Gateway using stored volumes to store data locally. Use Storage Gateway to asynchronously back up point-in-time snapshots of the data to Amazon S3.
D.
Deploy AWS Direct Connect to connect with the on-premises data center. Configure AWS Storage Gateway to store data locally. Use Storage Gateway to asynchronously back up point-in-time snapshots of the data to Amazon S3.

Answer: B

Explanation:
B. Deploy AWS Storage Gateway using cached volumes. Use Storage Gateway to store data in Amazon S3 while retaining copies of frequently accessed data subsets locally.
AWS Storage Gateway’s cached volumes let you use Amazon S3 as your primary data storage while retaining frequently accessed data locally in your storage gateway. Cached volumes minimize the need to scale your on-premises storage infrastructure, while still providing your applications with low-latency access to their frequently accessed data. All data transferred between your gateway and AWS storage is encrypted for security. You can also save on data transfer costs as AWS Storage Gateway compresses all data transferred between the gateway and AWS, allowing you to store more data in AWS while reducing your data transfer costs.

Question 700
A company runs a three-tier web application in a VPC across multiple Availability Zones. Amazon EC2 instances run in an Auto Scaling group for the application tier.
The company needs to make an automated scaling plan that will analyze each resource's daily and weekly historical workload trends. The configuration must scale resources appropriately according to both the forecast and live changes in utilization.
Which scaling strategy should a solutions architect recommend to meet these requirements?
A.
Implement dynamic scaling with step scaling based on average CPU utilization from the EC2 instances.
B.
Enable predictive scaling to forecast and scale. Configure dynamic scaling with target tracking
C.
Create an automated scheduled scaling action based on the traffic patterns of the web application.
D.
Set up a simple scaling policy. Increase the cooldown period based on the EC2 instance startup time.

Answer: B

Explanation:
By configuring dynamic scaling with target tracking, the company can automatically adjust resources based on the forecasted demand while also responding to live changes in utilization

Question 701
A company recently launched Linux-based application instances on Amazon EC2 in a private subnet and launched a Linux-based bastion host on an Amazon EC2 instance in a public subnet of a VPC. A solutions architect needs to connect from the on-premises network, through the company's internet connection, to the bastion host, and to the application servers. The solutions architect must make sure that the security groups of all the EC2 instances will allow that access.
Which combination of steps should the solutions architect take to meet these requirements? (Choose two.)
A.
Replace the current security group of the bastion host with one that only allows inbound access from the application instances.
B.
Replace the current security group of the bastion host with one that only allows inbound access from the internal IP range for the company.
C.
Replace the current security group of the bastion host with one that only allows inbound access from the external IP range for the company.
D.
Replace the current security group of the application instances with one that allows inbound SSH access from only the private IP address of the bastion host.
E.
Replace the current security group of the application instances with one that allows inbound SSH access from only the public IP address of the bastion host.

Answer: CD?CE?

Explanation:
CD
C. This will restrict access to the bastion host from the specific IP range of the on-premises network, ensuring secure connectivity. This step ensures that only authorized users from the on-premises network can access the bastion host.
D. This step enables SSH connectivity from the bastion host to the application instances in the private subnet. By allowing inbound SSH access only from the private IP address of the bastion host, you ensure that SSH access is restricted to the bastion host only

CE
Application is in private subnet 
Bastion Host is in public subnet 
D does not make sense because the bastion host is in public subnet and they don't have a private IP but only a public IP address attached to them. The IP wanting to connect is Public as well. 
Bastion host in public subnet allows external IP (via internet) of the company to access it. Which than leaves us to give permission to the application private subnet and for that the private subnet with the application accepts the IP coming from Bastion Host by changing its SG. C&E

Question 702
A package delivery company has an application that uses Amazon EC2 instances and an Amazon Aurora MySQL DB cluster. As the application becomes more popular, EC2 instance usage increases only slightly. DB cluster usage increases at a much faster rate.
The company adds a read replica, which reduces the DB cluster usage for a short period of time. However, the load continues to increase. The operations that cause the increase in DB cluster usage are all repeated read statements that are related to delivery details. The company needs to alleviate the effect of repeated reads on the DB cluster.
Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?
A.
Implement an Amazon ElastiCache for Redis cluster between the application and the DB cluster.
B.
Add an additional read replica to the DB cluster.
C.
Configure Aurora Auto Scaling for the Aurora read replicas.
D.
Modify the DB cluster to have multiple writer instances.

Answer: A

Explanation:
After topic reconsideration I will go with Aurora autoscaling
To meet your connectivity and workload requirements, Aurora Auto Scaling dynamically adjusts the number of Aurora Replicas (reader DB instances) provisioned for an Aurora DB cluster. Aurora Auto Scaling is available for both Aurora MySQL and Aurora PostgreSQL. Aurora Auto Scaling enables your Aurora DB cluster to handle sudden increases in connectivity or workload. When the connectivity or workload decreases, Aurora Auto Scaling removes unnecessary Aurora Replicas so that you don't pay for unused provisioned DB instances.
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.Integrating.AutoScaling.html

Question 703
A company has an application that uses an Amazon DynamoDB table for storage. A solutions architect discovers that many requests to the table are not returning the latest data. The company's users have not reported any other issues with database performance. Latency is in an acceptable range.
Which design change should the solutions architect recommend?
A.
Add read replicas to the table.
B.
Use a global secondary index (GSI).
C.
Request strongly consistent reads for the table.
D.
Request eventually consistent reads for the table.

Answer: C

Explanation:
DynamoDB by default provides eventual consistency for read operations, which means that a query may not reflect the most recent data changes immediately after an update. Instead, it may take some time for the data to propagate across all replicas in the DynamoDB global table.
To ensure that read operations return the latest data and address the issue of stale data being returned to users, the solutions architect should recommend switching the read consistency level from eventually consistent reads to strongly consistent reads.

Question 704
A company has deployed its application on Amazon EC2 instances with an Amazon RDS database. The company used the principle of least privilege to configure the database access credentials. The company's security team wants to protect the application and the database from SQL injection and other web-based attacks.

A.
Use security groups and network ACLs to secure the database and application servers.
B.
Use AWS WAF to protect the application. Use RDS parameter groups to configure the security settings.
C.
Use AWS Network Firewall to protect the application and the database.
D.
Use different database accounts in the application code for different functions. Avoid granting excessive privileges to the database users.

Answer: B

Explanation:

Question 705
An ecommerce company runs applications in AWS accounts that are part of an organization in AWS Organizations. The applications run on Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL databases across all the accounts. The company needs to prevent malicious activity and must identify abnormal failed and incomplete login attempts to the databases.

A.
Attach service control policies (SCPs) to the root of the organization to identity the failed login attempts.
B.
Enable the Amazon RDS Protection feature in Amazon GuardDuty for the member accounts of the organization.
C.
Publish the Aurora general logs to a log group in Amazon CloudWatch Logs. Export the log data to a central Amazon S3 bucket.
D.
Publish all the Aurora PostgreSQL database events in AWS CloudTrail to a central Amazon S3 bucket.

Answer: B

Explanation:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/CHAP_BestPractices.Security.html

Question 706
A company has an AWS Direct Connect connection from its corporate data center to its VPC in the us-east-1 Region. The company recently acquired a corporation that has several VPCs and a Direct Connect connection between its on-premises data center and the eu-west-2 Region. The CIDR blocks for the VPCs of the company and the corporation do not overlap. The company requires connectivity between two Regions and the data centers. The company needs a solution that is scalable while reducing operational overhead.
What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements?
A.
Set up inter-Region VPC peering between the VPC in us-east-1 and the VPCs in eu-west-2.
B.
Create private virtual interfaces from the Direct Connect connection in us-east-1 to the VPCs in eu-west-2.
C.
Establish VPN appliances in a fully meshed VPN network hosted by Amazon EC2. Use AWS VPN CloudHub to send and receive data between the data centers and each VPC.
D.
Connect the existing Direct Connect connection to a Direct Connect gateway. Route traffic from the virtual private gateways of the VPCs in each Region to the Direct Connect gateway.

Answer: D

Explanation:
Connect the existing Direct Connect connection to a Direct Connect gateway. Route traffic from the virtual private gateways of the VPCs in each Region to the Direct Connect gateway. 
Explanation:
Scalability and Reduced Overhead:
Using a Direct Connect gateway allows for easy scaling by adding more virtual private gateways from different regions to the same Direct Connect gateway, eliminating the need to manage separate connections for each region and minimizing operational overhead.
Inter-Region Connectivity:
A Direct Connect gateway acts as a central hub for routing traffic between VPCs in different regions through the Direct Connect connection, providing the required connectivity between the US-East-1 and EU-West-2 regions

Question 707
A company is developing a mobile game that streams score updates to a backend processor and then posts results on a leaderboard. A solutions architect needs to design a solution that can handle large traffic spikes, process the mobile game updates in order of receipt, and store the processed updates in a highly available database. The company also wants to minimize the management overhead required to maintain the solution.
What should the solutions architect do to meet these requirements?
A.
Push score updates to Amazon Kinesis Data Streams. Process the updates in Kinesis Data Streams with AWS Lambda. Store the processed updates in Amazon DynamoDB.
B.
Push score updates to Amazon Kinesis Data Streams. Process the updates with a fleet of Amazon EC2 instances set up for Auto Scaling. Store the processed updates in Amazon Redshift.
C.
Push score updates to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic. Subscribe an AWS Lambda function to the SNS topic to process the updates. Store the processed updates in a SQL database running on Amazon EC2.
D.
Push score updates to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Use a fleet of Amazon EC2 instances with Auto Scaling to process the updates in the SQS queue. Store the processed updates in an Amazon RDS Multi-AZ DB instance.

Answer: A

Explanation:
requirement -1: "Stream + process in order + Minimum Overhead" = Kinesis Data Stream + Lambda 
requirement-2: "Highly available database + Min Management overhead" = DynamoDb
Setting Up Ec2 instance or MultiAZ DB = overhead

Question 708
A company has multiple AWS accounts with applications deployed in the us-west-2 Region. Application logs are stored within Amazon S3 buckets in each account. The company wants to build a centralized log analysis solution that uses a single S3 bucket. Logs must not leave us-west-2, and the company wants to incur minimal operational overhead.
Which solution meets these requirements and is MOST cost-effective?
A.
Create an S3 Lifecycle policy that copies the objects from one of the application S3 buckets to the centralized S3 bucket.
B.
Use S3 Same-Region Replication to replicate logs from the S3 buckets to another S3 bucket in us-west-2. Use this S3 bucket for log analysis.
C.
Write a script that uses the PutObject API operation every day to copy the entire contents of the buckets to another S3 bucket in us-west-2. Use this S3 bucket for log analysis.
D.
Write AWS Lambda functions in these accounts that are triggered every time logs are delivered to the S3 buckets (s3:ObjectCreated:* event). Copy the logs to another S3 bucket in us-west-2. Use this S3 bucket for log analysis.

Answer: B

Explanation:
The main Use case of S3 same region replication is "log aggregation, live replication between production and test accounts".

Option C and D is out ot question since it required operation overhead. 
Between A and B, Lifecycle is used to transfer between S3storage classes and not within same S3 Buckets. So B is correct answer.

Question 709
A company has an application that delivers on-demand training videos to students around the world. The application also allows authorized content developers to upload videos. The data is stored in an Amazon S3 bucket in the us-east-2 Region.
The company has created an S3 bucket in the eu-west-2 Region and an S3 bucket in the ap-southeast-1 Region. The company wants to replicate the data to the new S3 buckets. The company needs to minimize latency for developers who upload videos and students who stream videos near eu-west-2 and ap-southeast-1.
Which combination of steps will meet these requirements with the FEWEST changes to the application? (Choose two.)
A.
Configure one-way replication from the us-east-2 S3 bucket to the eu-west-2 S3 bucket. Configure one-way replication from the us-east-2 S3 bucket to the ap-southeast-1 S3 bucket.
B.
Configure one-way replication from the us-east-2 S3 bucket to the eu-west-2 S3 bucket. Configure one-way replication from the eu-west-2 S3 bucket to the ap-southeast-1 S3 bucket.
C.
Configure two-way (bidirectional) replication among the S3 buckets that are in all three Regions.
D.
Create an S3 Multi-Region Access Point. Modify the application to use the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Multi-Region Access Point for video streaming. Do not modify the application for video uploads.
E.
Create an S3 Multi-Region Access Point. Modify the application to use the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Multi-Region Access Point for video streaming and uploads.

Answer: CD?CE?

Explanation:
CD
C => Although stem did not specify which region S# bucket the developers will upload their contents, this will allow new contents in 1 S3 bucket to replicate over to the other 2 S3 buckets.
D => uploads needs to be performed to the first region only (Closest???) and accessed by remaining two S3 buckets.


CE
To keep replication in SYNC across all three regions, we use Bi-directional.
Multi-Region Access Point for video streaming and uploads. -> uploads to nearest Low latency region and Bi-directional replication will keep other two regions in SYNC this reducing the upload and streaming latency

Question 710
A company has a new mobile app. Anywhere in the world, users can see local news on topics they choose. Users also can post photos and videos from inside the app.
Users access content often in the first minutes after the content is posted. New content quickly replaces older content, and then the older content disappears. The local nature of the news means that users consume 90% of the content within the AWS Region where it is uploaded.
Which solution will optimize the user experience by providing the LOWEST latency for content uploads?
A.
Upload and store content in Amazon S3. Use Amazon CloudFront for the uploads.
B.
Upload and store content in Amazon S3. Use S3 Transfer Acceleration for the uploads.
C.
Upload content to Amazon EC2 instances in the Region that is closest to the user. Copy the data to Amazon S3.
D.
Upload and store content in Amazon S3 in the Region that is closest to the user. Use multiple distributions of Amazon CloudFront.

Answer: B?D?

Explanation:
B
Question says - " LOWEST latency for content uploads"
Hence Use S3 Transfer Acceleration for the uploads.

D
CloudFront does support upload acceleration

Question 711
A company is building a new application that uses serverless architecture. The architecture will consist of an Amazon API Gateway REST API and AWS Lambda functions to manage incoming requests.
The company wants to add a service that can send messages received from the API Gateway REST API to multiple target Lambda functions for processing. The service must offer message filtering that gives the target Lambda functions the ability to receive only the messages the functions need.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?
A.
Send the requests from the API Gateway REST API to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic. Subscribe Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queues to the SNS topic. Configure the target Lambda functions to poll the different SQS queues.
B.
Send the requests from the API Gateway REST API to Amazon EventBridge. Configure EventBridge to invoke the target Lambda functions.
C.
Send the requests from the API Gateway REST API to Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (Amazon MSK). Configure Amazon MSK to publish the messages to the target Lambda functions.
D.
Send the requests from the API Gateway REST API to multiple Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queues. Configure the target Lambda functions to poll the different SQS queues.

Answer: A?B?

Explanation:
A
The main issue with B is that with Eventbrige, you can only define up to five targets for each rule. 
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-targets.html

B
Least operational overhead:
EventBridge is designed specifically for event routing and filtering, making it the most efficient option for managing which Lambda functions receive messages based on specific criteria, minimizing operational overhead compared to the other choices.
Message filtering:
EventBridge allows you to define detailed rules with attributes and conditions to filter messages and send them only to the relevant Lambda functions, fulfilling the requirement for message filtering.
Scalability:
Both EventBridge and SNS can handle large volumes of messages, but EventBridge offers better management and control over message routing, especially when dealing with complex event patterns.

Question 712
A solutions architect is designing a two-tier web application. The application consists of a public-facing web tier hosted on Amazon EC2 in public subnets. The database tier consists of Microsoft SQL Server running on Amazon EC2 in a private subnet. Security is a high priority for the company.
How should security groups be configured in this situation? (Choose two.)
A.
Configure the security group for the web tier to allow inbound traffic on port 443 from 0.0.0.0/0.
B.
Configure the security group for the web tier to allow outbound traffic on port 443 from 0.0.0.0/0.
C.
Configure the security group for the database tier to allow inbound traffic on port 1433 from the security group for the web tier.
D.
Configure the security group for the database tier to allow outbound traffic on ports 443 and 1433 to the security group for the web tier.
E.
Configure the security group for the database tier to allow inbound traffic on ports 443 and 1433 from the security group for the web tier.

Answer: AC

Explanation:
A. This configuration allows external users to access the web tier over HTTPS (port 443). However, it's important to note that it is generally recommended to restrict the source IP range to a more specific range rather than allowing access from 0.0.0.0/0 (anywhere). This would limit access to only trusted sources.
C. By allowing inbound traffic on port 1433 (default port for Microsoft SQL Server) from the security group associated with the web tier, you ensure that the database tier can only be accessed by the EC2 instances in the web tier. This provides a level of isolation and restricts direct access to the database tier from external sources.

Question 713
A company migrated millions of archival files to Amazon S3. A solutions architect needs to implement a solution that will encrypt all the archival data by using a customer-provided key. The solution must encrypt existing unencrypted objects and future objects.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Create a list of unencrypted objects by filtering an Amazon S3 Inventory report. Configure an S3 Batch Operations job to encrypt the objects from the list with a server-side encryption with a customer-provided key (SSE-C). Configure the S3 default encryption feature to use a server-side encryption with a customer-provided key (SSE-C).
B.
Use S3 Storage Lens metrics to identify unencrypted S3 buckets. Configure the S3 default encryption feature to use a server-side encryption with AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS).
C.
Create a list of unencrypted objects by filtering the AWS usage report for Amazon S3. Configure an AWS Batch job to encrypt the objects from the list with a server-side encryption with AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS). Configure the S3 default encryption feature to use a server-side encryption with AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS).
D.
Create a list of unencrypted objects by filtering the AWS usage report for Amazon S3. Configure the S3 default encryption feature to use a server-side encryption with a customer-provided key (SSE-C).

Answer: A

Explanation:
S3 inventory list has "Encryption status" field so you can use this to filter the unencrypted objects. and use S3 batch to encrypt it with SSE-C key.
AWS Usage report does not provide details about encryption status of individual objects

Question 714

Answer: A

Explanation:
A -> Correct as we need to route to a Company in public network.
B -> No, because it routes only within one or more VPC
C -> Added as a distractor
D -> Inbound resolver is for traffic from On-Prem to VPC

Question 715
A company is building an application on AWS that connects to an Amazon RDS database. The company wants to manage the application configuration and to securely store and retrieve credentials for the database and other services.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST administrative overhead?
A.
Use AWS AppConfig to store and manage the application configuration. Use AWS Secrets Manager to store and retrieve the credentials.
B.
Use AWS Lambda to store and manage the application configuration. Use AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store to store and retrieve the credentials.
C.
Use an encrypted application configuration file. Store the file in Amazon S3 for the application configuration. Create another S3 file to store and retrieve the credentials.
D.
Use AWS AppConfig to store and manage the application configuration. Use Amazon RDS to store and retrieve the credentials.

Answer: A

Explanation:
AppConfig useCase = You can use AWS AppConfig to deploy configuration data stored in the AWS AppConfig hosted configuration store, AWS Secrets Manager, Systems Manager Parameter Store, or Amazon S3.
So B and C are out.
use RDS to store credentials is not a good practise. So D is out.

Question 716
To meet security requirements, a company needs to encrypt all of its application data in transit while communicating with an Amazon RDS MySQL DB instance. A recent security audit revealed that encryption at rest is enabled using AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS), but data in transit is not enabled.
What should a solutions architect do to satisfy the security requirements?
A.
Enable IAM database authentication on the database.
B.
Provide self-signed certificates. Use the certificates in all connections to the RDS instance.
C.
Take a snapshot of the RDS instance. Restore the snapshot to a new instance with encryption enabled.
D.
Download AWS-provided root certificates. Provide the certificates in all connections to the RDS instance.

Answer: D

Explanation:
To encrypt data in transit to an RDS MySQL instance, you need to configure the database connection to use TLS/SSL, which requires using AWS-provided root certificates to establish a secure connection.

A (IAM database authentication): While important for user access control, this does not address data encryption in transit. 
B (Self-signed certificates): Using self-signed certificates is not recommended for production environments as they cannot be verified by the client and might raise security concerns. 
C (Snapshot and restore): Taking a snapshot and restoring to a new instance with encryption enabled only affects data at rest, not data in transit.

Question 717
A company is designing a new web service that will run on Amazon EC2 instances behind an Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) load balancer. However, many of the web service clients can only reach IP addresses authorized on their firewalls.
What should a solutions architect recommend to meet the clients’ needs?
A.
A Network Load Balancer with an associated Elastic IP address.
B.
An Application Load Balancer with an associated Elastic IP address.
C.
An A record in an Amazon Route 53 hosted zone pointing to an Elastic IP address.
D.
An EC2 instance with a public IP address running as a proxy in front of the load balancer.

Answer: A

Explanation:

B -> Application Load Balancer cannot be assigned an Elastic IP address (static IP address).
C -> Its DNS after all, "Associated elastic IP" is what IP? Makes no sense
D -> "If you require a persistent public IP address that can be associated to and from instances as you require, use an Elastic IP address instead." PUBLIC IP of an EC2 is not persistent, although we can give an Elastic Ip, Using EC2 in front of a Load Balancer is tooooo much. What if it gets a million request? So to scale that EC2 you use another LB and an ASG>? This makes no sense
A is correct because a NLB can have an elastic IP and we can use this in our firewall as per the use case

Question 718
A company has established a new AWS account. The account is newly provisioned and no changes have been made to the default settings. The company is concerned about the security of the AWS account root user.
What should be done to secure the root user?
A.
Create IAM users for daily administrative tasks. Disable the root user.
B.
Create IAM users for daily administrative tasks. Enable multi-factor authentication on the root user.
C.
Generate an access key for the root user. Use the access key for daily administration tasks instead of the AWS Management Console.
D.
Provide the root user credentials to the most senior solutions architect. Have the solutions architect use the root user for daily administration tasks.

Answer: B

Explanation:
"As a best practice, do not use the AWS account root user for any task where it's not required. Instead, create a new IAM user for each person that requires administrator access."

C. Run the EC2 instances in a cluster placement group. A cluster placement group is a logical grouping of instances within a single Availability Zone. This configuration is recommended for applications that need low network latency, high network throughput, or both.

Question 720
A financial services company wants to shut down two data centers and migrate more than 100 TB of data to AWS. The data has an intricate directory structure with millions of small files stored in deep hierarchies of subfolders. Most of the data is unstructured, and the company’s file storage consists of SMB-based storage types from multiple vendors. The company does not want to change its applications to access the data after migration.
What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?
A.
Use AWS Direct Connect to migrate the data to Amazon S3.
B.
Use AWS DataSync to migrate the data to Amazon FSx for Lustre.
C.
Use AWS DataSync to migrate the data to Amazon FSx for Windows File Server.
D.
Use AWS Direct Connect to migrate the data on-premises file storage to an AWS Storage Gateway volume gateway.

Answer: C

Explanation:
AWS DataSync is a data transfer service that simplifies, automates, and accelerates moving and replicating data between on-premises storage systems and AWS storage services over the internet or AWS Direct Connect. DataSync can transfer your file data, and also file system metadata such as ownership, time stamps, and access permissions.
In DataSync, a location for Amazon FSx for Windows is an endpoint for an FSx for Windows File Server. You can transfer files between a location for Amazon FSx for Windows and a location for other file systems. For information, see Working with Locations in the AWS DataSync User Guide.
DataSync accesses your FSx for Windows File Server using the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol.

Question 722
A company’s website is used to sell products to the public. The site runs on Amazon EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB). There is also an Amazon CloudFront distribution, and AWS WAF is being used to protect against SQL injection attacks. The ALB is the origin for the CloudFront distribution. A recent review of security logs revealed an external malicious IP that needs to be blocked from accessing the website.
What should a solutions architect do to protect the application?
A.
Modify the network ACL on the CloudFront distribution to add a deny rule for the malicious IP address.
B.
Modify the configuration of AWS WAF to add an IP match condition to block the malicious IP address.
C.
Modify the network ACL for the EC2 instances in the target groups behind the ALB to deny the malicious IP address.
D.
Modify the security groups for the EC2 instances in the target groups behind the ALB to deny the malicious IP address.

Answer: B

Explanation:
There was option from disttribution Security Tab ==> Request logs for the specified time range where someone could target an IP address and block it - which action won't do more than creating a block rule under the associated Web ACL- but function has vanished, i don't ask me why.
So the only feasable option in WEBACLv2 is to go for an Ipset and ad a WebACL ip match block condition.
I really liked the option A the first time i experimented it.

Question 723
A company wants to move a multi-tiered application from on premises to the AWS Cloud to improve the application's performance. The application consists of application tiers that communicate with each other by way of RESTful services. Transactions are dropped when one tier becomes overloaded. A solutions architect must design a solution that resolves these issues and modernizes the application.
Which solution meets these requirements and is the MOST operationally efficient?
A.
Use Amazon API Gateway and direct transactions to the AWS Lambda functions as the application layer. Use Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) as the communication layer between application services.
B.
Use Amazon CloudWatch metrics to analyze the application performance history to determine the servers' peak utilization during the performance failures. Increase the size of the application server's Amazon EC2 instances to meet the peak requirements.
C.
Use Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) to handle the messaging between application servers running on Amazon EC2 in an Auto Scaling group. Use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor the SNS queue length and scale up and down as required.
D.
Use Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) to handle the messaging between application servers running on Amazon EC2 in an Auto Scaling group. Use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor the SQS queue length and scale up when communication failures are detected.

Answer: A?D?

Explanation:
A
The catch phrase is "scale up when communication failures are detected" Scaling should not be based on communication failures, that'll be crying over spilled milk ! or rather too late. So D is wrong.

D
This solution addresses the issue of dropped transactions by decoupling the communication between application tiers using SQS. It ensures that transactions are not lost even if one tier becomes overloaded.
By using EC2 in ASG, the application can automatically scale based on the demand and the length of the SQS. This allows for efficient utilization of resources and ensures that the application can handle increased workload and communication failures.
CloudWatch is used to monitor the length of SQS. When queue length exceeds a certain threshold, indicating potential communication failures, the ASG can be configured to scale up by adding more instances to handle the load.
D. This solution utilizes Lambda and API Gateway, which can be a valid approach for building serverless applications. However, it may introduce additional complexity and operational overhead compared to the requirement of modernizing an existing multi-tiered application.

Question 724
A company sets up an organization in AWS Organizations that contains 10 AWS accounts. A solutions architect must design a solution to provide access to the accounts for several thousand employees. The company has an existing identity provider (IdP). The company wants to use the existing IdP for authentication to AWS.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Create IAM users for the employees in the required AWS accounts. Connect IAM users to the existing IdP. Configure federated authentication for the IAM users.
B.
Set up AWS account root users with user email addresses and passwords that are synchronized from the existing IdP.
C.
Configure AWS IAM Identity Center (AWS Single Sign-On). Connect IAM Identity Center to the existing IdP. Provision users and groups from the existing IdP.
D.
Use AWS Resource Access Manager (AWS RAM) to share access to the AWS accounts with the users in the existing IdP.

Answer: C

Explanation:
Regardless of how you provision users, IAM Identity Center redirects the AWS Management Console, command line interface, and application authentication to your external IdP. IAM Identity Center then grants access to those resources based on policies you create in IAM Identity Center https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/manage-your-identity-source-idp.html#provisioning-when-external-idp

Question 725
A solutions architect is designing an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) authorization model for a company's AWS account. The company has designated five specific employees to have full access to AWS services and resources in the AWS account.
The solutions architect has created an IAM user for each of the five designated employees and has created an IAM user group.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Attach the AdministratorAccess resource-based policy to the IAM user group. Place each of the five designated employee IAM users in the IAM user group.
B.
Attach the SystemAdministrator identity-based policy to the IAM user group. Place each of the five designated employee IAM users in the IAM user group.
C.
Attach the AdministratorAccess identity-based policy to the IAM user group. Place each of the five designated employee IAM users in the IAM user group.
D.
Attach the SystemAdministrator resource-based policy to the IAM user group. Place each of the five designated employee IAM users in the IAM user group.

Answer: C

Explanation:
The question says "full access to AWS services and resources in the AWS account" and "created an IAM user group."
You can see it is identity-based policy, not resource-based.--->A and D are out.
SystemAdministrator: Allow 28 of 412 services.--->B is out.
AdministratorAccess: Allow 412 of 412 services.--->C is the correct answer.
If you are curious about what a policy can allow for, just log in you AWS account and go to IAM-policies to find out.

Question 726
A company has a multi-tier payment processing application that is based on virtual machines (VMs). The communication between the tiers occurs asynchronously through a third-party middleware solution that guarantees exactly-once delivery.
The company needs a solution that requires the least amount of infrastructure management. The solution must guarantee exactly-once delivery for application messaging.
Which combination of actions will meet these requirements? (Choose two.)
A.
Use AWS Lambda for the compute layers in the architecture.
B.
Use Amazon EC2 instances for the compute layers in the architecture.
C.
Use Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) as the messaging component between the compute layers.
D.
Use Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) FIFO queues as the messaging component between the compute layers.
E.
Use containers that are based on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) for the compute layers in the architecture.

Answer: AD

Explanation:
"As its name suggests, exactly-once semantics means that each message is delivered precisely once. The message can neither be lost nor delivered twice (or more times)."
- SNS doesn't provide exactly-once delivery. Thus, we need SQS.
- To achieve "least amount of intra management", we go with Lambda for compute layer.

Question 727
A company has a nightly batch processing routine that analyzes report files that an on-premises file system receives daily through SFTP. The company wants to move the solution to the AWS Cloud. The solution must be highly available and resilient. The solution also must minimize operational effort.

A.
Deploy AWS Transfer for SFTP and an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file system for storage. Use an Amazon EC2 instance in an Auto Scaling group with a scheduled scaling policy to run the batch operation.
B.
Deploy an Amazon EC2 instance that runs Linux and an SFTP service. Use an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume for storage. Use an Auto Scaling group with the minimum number of instances and desired number of instances set to 1.
C.
Deploy an Amazon EC2 instance that runs Linux and an SFTP service. Use an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file system for storage. Use an Auto Scaling group with the minimum number of instances and desired number of instances set to 1.
D.
Deploy AWS Transfer for SFTP and an Amazon S3 bucket for storage. Modify the application to pull the batch files from Amazon S3 to an Amazon EC2 instance for processing. Use an EC2 instance in an Auto Scaling group with a scheduled scaling policy to run the batch operation.

Answer: A

Explanation:
The Answer should be A not D because ...
Modify the application to pull the batch files from Amazon S3 to an Amazon EC2 instance for processing.--Why we need to do this when we can move the file directly to EFS in EC2 system
AWS Transfer Family now also supports file transfers to Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file systems as well as Amazon S3.

Question 728
A company has users all around the world accessing its HTTP-based application deployed on Amazon EC2 instances in multiple AWS Regions. The company wants to improve the availability and performance of the application. The company also wants to protect the application against common web exploits that may affect availability, compromise security, or consume excessive resources. Static IP addresses are required.
What should a solutions architect recommend to accomplish this?
A.
Put the EC2 instances behind Network Load Balancers (NLBs) in each Region. Deploy AWS WAF on the NLBs. Create an accelerator using AWS Global Accelerator and register the NLBs as endpoints.
B.
Put the EC2 instances behind Application Load Balancers (ALBs) in each Region. Deploy AWS WAF on the ALBs. Create an accelerator using AWS Global Accelerator and register the ALBs as endpoints.
C.
Put the EC2 instances behind Network Load Balancers (NLBs) in each Region. Deploy AWS WAF on the NLBs. Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution with an origin that uses Amazon Route 53 latency-based routing to route requests to the NLBs.
D.
Put the EC2 instances behind Application Load Balancers (ALBs) in each Region. Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution with an origin that uses Amazon Route 53 latency-based routing to route requests to the ALBs. Deploy AWS WAF on the CloudFront distribution.

Answer: B

Explanation:
HTTP based application so ALB is required.
because static IP addresses are required, we should use global accelerator:
"By default, Global Accelerator provides you with static IP addresses that you associate with your accelerator."

Question 729
A company’s data platform uses an Amazon Aurora MySQL database. The database has multiple read replicas and multiple DB instances across different Availability Zones. Users have recently reported errors from the database that indicate that there are too many connections. The company wants to reduce the failover time by 20% when a read replica is promoted to primary writer.
Which solution will meet this requirement?
A.
Switch from Aurora to Amazon RDS with Multi-AZ cluster deployment.
B.
Use Amazon RDS Proxy in front of the Aurora database.
C.
Switch to Amazon DynamoDB with DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) for read connections.
D.
Switch to Amazon Redshift with relocation capability.

Answer: B

Explanation:
By using Amazon RDS Proxy, your applications can pool and share database connections. This pooling improves scalability by allowing multiple application instances to reuse existing connections.
It also makes your applications more resilient to database failures. When a primary database instance fails, RDS Proxy automatically connects to a standby DB instance while preserving application connections. =>https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/rds-proxy.html

Question 730
A company stores text files in Amazon S3. The text files include customer chat messages, date and time information, and customer personally identifiable information (PII).
The company needs a solution to provide samples of the conversations to an external service provider for quality control. The external service provider needs to randomly pick sample conversations up to the most recent conversation. The company must not share the customer PII with the external service provider. The solution must scale when the number of customer conversations increases.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?
A.
Create an Object Lambda Access Point. Create an AWS Lambda function that redacts the PII when the function reads the file. Instruct the external service provider to access the Object Lambda Access Point.
B.
Create a batch process on an Amazon EC2 instance that regularly reads all new files, redacts the PII from the files, and writes the redacted files to a different S3 bucket. Instruct the external service provider to access the bucket that does not contain the PII. B. Create a web application on an Amazon EC2 instance that presents a list of the files, redacts the PII from the files, and allows the external service provider to download new versions of the files that have the PII redacted.
C.
Create an Amazon DynamoDB table. Create an AWS Lambda function that reads only the data in the files that does not contain PII. Configure the Lambda function to store the non-PII data in the DynamoDB table when a new file is written to Amazon S3. Grant the external service provider access to the DynamoDB table.

Answer: A

Explanation:
Use AWS Lambda functions to change the Object before it is retrieved by the caller application. Only one S3 bucket is needed, on top of which we create S3 Access Point And S3 Object Lambda Access Points
Use case: 
1. Redact PII for analytics or non-production environment
2. Convert across data formats ex: XML to Json
3. Resizing and watermaking images on fly using caller-specific details ex: user who requested the object

Question 731

A.
Enable termination protection for the EC2 instance.
B.
Configure the EC2 instance for Multi-AZ deployment.
C.
Create an Amazon CloudWatch alarm to recover the EC2 instance in case of failure.
D.
Launch the EC2 instance with two Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes that use RAID configurations for storage redundancy.

Answer: C

Explanation:
A. Enable termination protection for the EC2 instance.
No. Termination protection is about avoid accidentally delete the instance
B. Configure the EC2 instance for Multi-AZ deployment.
No. Question says "cannot run on more than one instance"
C. Create an Amazon CloudWatch alarm to recover the EC2 instance in case of failure.
Yes. CloudWatch can be used to recover the instance: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/UsingAlarmActions.html#AddingRecoverActions
D. Launch the EC2 instance with two Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes that use RAID configurations for storage redundancy.
No. Raid could be helpful to increase resilience, but does not help with "improve the recovery time"

Question 732
A company wants to deploy its containerized application workloads to a VPC across three Availability Zones. The company needs a solution that is highly available across Availability Zones. The solution must require minimal changes to the application.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?
A.
Use Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS). Configure Amazon ECS Service Auto Scaling to use target tracking scaling. Set the minimum capacity to 3. Set the task placement strategy type to spread with an Availability Zone attribute.
B.
Use Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) self-managed nodes. Configure Application Auto Scaling to use target tracking scaling. Set the minimum capacity to 3.
C.
Use Amazon EC2 Reserved Instances. Launch three EC2 instances in a spread placement group. Configure an Auto Scaling group to use target tracking scaling. Set the minimum capacity to 3.
D.
Use an AWS Lambda function. Configure the Lambda function to connect to a VPC. Configure Application Auto Scaling to use Lambda as a scalable target. Set the minimum capacity to 3.

Answer: A

Explanation:
Amazon EKS self-managed nodes require you to manually install and configure the Kubernetes node components, such as kubelet, kube-proxy, and Docker, on your Amazon EC2 instances. You also need to manage the security group, IAM role, and subnet for your node group. Amazon ECS handles these tasks for you when you use the Amazon EC2 launch type .

Question 733
A media company stores movies in Amazon S3. Each movie is stored in a single video file that ranges from 1 GB to 10 GB in size.
The company must be able to provide the streaming content of a movie within 5 minutes of a user purchase. There is higher demand for movies that are less than 20 years old than for movies that are more than 20 years old. The company wants to minimize hosting service costs based on demand.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Store all media content in Amazon S3. Use S3 Lifecycle policies to move media data into the Infrequent Access tier when the demand for a movie decreases.
B.
Store newer movie video files in S3 Standard. Store older movie video files in S3 Standard-infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA). When a user orders an older movie, retrieve the video file by using standard retrieval.
C.
Store newer movie video files in S3 Intelligent-Tiering. Store older movie video files in S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval. When a user orders an older movie, retrieve the video file by using expedited retrieval.
D.
Store newer movie video files in S3 Standard. Store older movie video files in S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval. When a user orders an older movie, retrieve the video file by using bulk retrieval.

Answer: B?C?

Explanation:
B
S3 Standard-IA is for data that is accessed less frequently, but requires rapid access when needed. S3 Standard-IA offers the high durability, high throughput, and low latency of S3 Standard, with a low per GB storage price and per GB retrieval chargehttps://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/

C
Expedited retrievals is typically made available within 1–5 minutes. Each unit of capacity provides that at least three Expedited retrievals can be performed every 5 minutes and provides up to 150 megabytes per second (MBps) of retrieval throughput.
There are some limitations but the bottom line is 5 minutes and I believe this leads us to Expedited retrievals.

Question 734
A company receives 10 TB of instrumentation data each day from several machines located at a single factory. The data consists of JSON files stored on a storage area network (SAN) in an on-premises data center located within the factory. The company wants to send this data to Amazon S3 where it can be accessed by several additional systems that provide critical near-real-time analytics. A secure transfer is important because the data is considered sensitive.
Which solution offers the MOST reliable data transfer?
A.
AWS DataSync over public internet
B.
AWS DataSync over AWS Direct Connect
C.
AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) over public internet
D.
AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) over AWS Direct Connect

Answer: B

Explanation:
DataSync is a service specifically designed for data transfer and synchronization between on-premises storage systems and AWS storage services like S3. It provides reliable and efficient data transfer capabilities, ensuring the secure movement of large volumes of data.
By leveraging Direct Connect, which establishes a dedicated network connection between the on-premises data center and AWS, the data transfer is conducted over a private and dedicated network link. This approach offers increased reliability, lower latency, and consistent network performance compared to transferring data over the public internet.
Database Migration Service is primarily focused on database migration and replication, and it may not be the most appropriate tool for general-purpose data transfer like JSON files.
Transferring data over the public internet may introduce potential security risks and performance variability due to factors like network congestion, latency, and potential interruptions.

Question 735
A solutions architect needs to design the architecture for an application that a vendor provides as a Docker container image. The container needs 50 GB of storage available for temporary files. The infrastructure must be serverless.

A.
Create an AWS Lambda function that uses the Docker container image with an Amazon S3 mounted volume that has more than 50 GB of space.
B.
Create an AWS Lambda function that uses the Docker container image with an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume that has more than 50 GB of space.
C.
Create an Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) cluster that uses the AWS Fargate launch type. Create a task definition for the container image with an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) volume. Create a service with that task definition.
D.
Create an Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) cluster that uses the Amazon EC2 launch type with an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume that has more than 50 GB of space. Create a task definition for the container image. Create a service with that task definition.

Answer: C

Explanation:
Options A and B involve AWS Lambda, which is suitable for event-driven, short-lived compute tasks, but it's NOT ideal for long-running containerized applications and managing large volumes of data.

Question 736
A company needs to use its on-premises LDAP directory service to authenticate its users to the AWS Management Console. The directory service is not compatible with Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML).
Which solution meets these requirements?
A.
Enable AWS IAM Identity Center (AWS Single Sign-On) between AWS and the on-premises LDAP.
B.
Create an IAM policy that uses AWS credentials, and integrate the policy into LDAP.
C.
Set up a process that rotates the IAM credentials whenever LDAP credentials are updated.
D.
Develop an on-premises custom identity broker application or process that uses AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS) to get short-lived credentials.

Answer: D

Explanation:
The solution that best meets the requirements. This approach provides a pathway for authenticating LDAP users to AWS without requiring direct LDAP to AWS IAM Identity Center integration or SAML compatibility, offering a flexible and secure method to extend on-premises authentication mechanisms to AWS services.

Question 737
A company stores multiple Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) in an AWS account to launch its Amazon EC2 instances. The AMIs contain critical data and configurations that are necessary for the company’s operations. The company wants to implement a solution that will recover accidentally deleted AMIs quickly and efficiently.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?
A.
Create Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) snapshots of the AMIs. Store the snapshots in a separate AWS account.
B.
Copy all AMIs to another AWS account periodically.
C.
Create a retention rule in Recycle Bin.
D.
Upload the AMIs to an Amazon S3 bucket that has Cross-Region Replication.

Answer: C

Explanation:
Recycle Bin is a data recovery feature that enables you to restore accidentally deleted Amazon EBS snapshots and EBS-backed AMIs. When using Recycle Bin, if your resources are deleted, they are retained in the Recycle Bin for a time period that you specify before being permanently deleted. You can restore a resource from the Recycle Bin at any time before its retention period expires. This solution has the least operational overhead, as you do not need to create, copy, or upload any additional resources. You can also manage tags and permissions for AMIs in the Recycle Bin. AMIs in the Recycle Bin do not incur any additional charges.Reference:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/recycle-bin-working-with-rules.html

Question 738
A company has 150 TB of archived image data stored on-premises that needs to be moved to the AWS Cloud within the next month. The company’s current network connection allows up to 100 Mbps uploads for this purpose during the night only.
What is the MOST cost-effective mechanism to move this data and meet the migration deadline?
A.
Use AWS Snowmobile to ship the data to AWS.
B.
Order multiple AWS Snowball devices to ship the data to AWS.
C.
Enable Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration and securely upload the data.
D.
Create an Amazon S3 VPC endpoint and establish a VPN to upload the data.

Answer: B

Explanation:
SnowBall Storage will give us 80TB. To transfer data we will need 2 devices. Taking into consideration that 1 device = ~300$ we will spend 600$. Option B is most Cost effective and will allow us to end operation in lest then month.

Question 739
A company wants to migrate its three-tier application from on premises to AWS. The web tier and the application tier are running on third-party virtual machines (VMs). The database tier is running on MySQL.
The company needs to migrate the application by making the fewest possible changes to the architecture. The company also needs a database solution that can restore data to a specific point in time.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?
A.
Migrate the web tier and the application tier to Amazon EC2 instances in private subnets. Migrate the database tier to Amazon RDS for MySQL in private subnets.
B.
Migrate the web tier to Amazon EC2 instances in public subnets. Migrate the application tier to EC2 instances in private subnets. Migrate the database tier to Amazon Aurora MySQL in private subnets.
C.
Migrate the web tier to Amazon EC2 instances in public subnets. Migrate the application tier to EC2 instances in private subnets. Migrate the database tier to Amazon RDS for MySQL in private subnets.
D.
Migrate the web tier and the application tier to Amazon EC2 instances in public subnets. Migrate the database tier to Amazon Aurora MySQL in public subnets.

Answer: B

Explanation:
I'm between B and C. Since RDS requires an additional configuration for PTR, it adds an operational overhead. So I will go with B.
Aurora provides automated backup and point-in-time recovery, simplifying backup management and data protection. Continuous incremental backups are taken automatically and stored in Amazon S3, and data retention periods can be specified to meet compliance requirements. 
RDS provides the same but first, the users should set a retention period for these backups, allowing historical data recovery in case of accidental data loss or corruption, and point-in-time recovery (PITR) allows users to restore the database to any specific moment within the set retention period.

Question 741
A company’s developers want a secure way to gain SSH access on the company's Amazon EC2 instances that run the latest version of Amazon Linux. The developers work remotely and in the corporate office.
The company wants to use AWS services as a part of the solution. The EC2 instances are hosted in a VPC private subnet and access the internet through a NAT gateway that is deployed in a public subnet.
What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?
A.
Create a bastion host in the same subnet as the EC2 instances. Grant the ec2:CreateVpnConnection IAM permission to the developers. Install EC2 Instance Connect so that the developers can connect to the EC2 instances.
B.
Create an AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection between the corporate network and the VPC. Instruct the developers to use the Site-to-Site VPN connection to access the EC2 instances when the developers are on the corporate network. Instruct the developers to set up another VPN connection for access when they work remotely.
C.
Create a bastion host in the public subnet of the VPConfigure the security groups and SSH keys of the bastion host to only allow connections and SSH authentication from the developers’ corporate and remote networks. Instruct the developers to connect through the bastion host by using SSH to reach the EC2 instances.
D.
Attach the AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore IAM policy to an IAM role that is associated with the EC2 instances. Instruct the developers to use AWS Systems Manager Session Manager to access the EC2 instances.

Answer: D

Explanation:
AWS Systems Manager Session Manager is a service that enables you to securely connect to your EC2 instances without using SSH keys or bastion hosts. You can use Session Manager to access your instances through the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the AWS SDKs. Session Manager uses IAM policies and roles to control who can access which instances. By attaching the AmazonSSMManagedlnstanceCore IAM policy to an IAM role that is associated with the EC2 instances, you grant the Session Manager service the necessary permissions to perform actions on your instances. You also need to attach another IAM policy to the developers' IAM users or roles that allows them to start sessions to the instances.

Question 742
A pharmaceutical company is developing a new drug. The volume of data that the company generates has grown exponentially over the past few months. The company's researchers regularly require a subset of the entire dataset to be immediately available with minimal lag. However, the entire dataset does not need to be accessed on a daily basis. All the data currently resides in on-premises storage arrays, and the company wants to reduce ongoing capital expenses.
Which storage solution should a solutions architect recommend to meet these requirements?
A.
Run AWS DataSync as a scheduled cron job to migrate the data to an Amazon S3 bucket on an ongoing basis.
B.
Deploy an AWS Storage Gateway file gateway with an Amazon S3 bucket as the target storage. Migrate the data to the Storage Gateway appliance.
C.
Deploy an AWS Storage Gateway volume gateway with cached volumes with an Amazon S3 bucket as the target storage. Migrate the data to the Storage Gateway appliance.
D.
Configure an AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection from the on-premises environment to AWS. Migrate data to an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file system.

Answer: C

Explanation:
Deploying an AWS Storage Gateway volume gateway with cached volumes will allow to store all data in AWS but the most frequently accessed data will be stored/cached localy (on-premises) = low latency for most used data while all data will be stored in the cloud.

Question 743
A company has a business-critical application that runs on Amazon EC2 instances. The application stores data in an Amazon DynamoDB table. The company must be able to revert the table to any point within the last 24 hours.
Which solution meets these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?
A.
Configure point-in-time recovery for the table.
B.
Use AWS Backup for the table.
C.
Use an AWS Lambda function to make an on-demand backup of the table every hour.
D.
Turn on streams on the table to capture a log of all changes to the table in the last 24 hours. Store a copy of the stream in an Amazon S3 bucket.

Answer: A

Explanation:
Point-in-time recovery helps protect your DynamoDB tables from accidental write or delete operations. With point-in-time recovery, you don't have to worry about creating, maintaining, or scheduling on-demand backups. For example, suppose that a test script writes accidentally to a production DynamoDB table. With point-in-time recovery, you can restore that table to any point in time during the last 35 days. After you enable point-in-time recovery, you can restore to any point in time from five minutes before the current time until 35 days ago. DynamoDB maintains incremental backups of your table.

Question 745
A company needs to configure a real-time data ingestion architecture for its application. The company needs an API, a process that transforms data as the data is streamed, and a storage solution for the data.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?
A.
Deploy an Amazon EC2 instance to host an API that sends data to an Amazon Kinesis data stream. Create an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream that uses the Kinesis data stream as a data source. Use AWS Lambda functions to transform the data. Use the Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream to send the data to Amazon S3.
B.
Deploy an Amazon EC2 instance to host an API that sends data to AWS Glue. Stop source/destination checking on the EC2 instance. Use AWS Glue to transform the data and to send the data to Amazon S3.
C.
Configure an Amazon API Gateway API to send data to an Amazon Kinesis data stream. Create an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream that uses the Kinesis data stream as a data source. Use AWS Lambda functions to transform the data. Use the Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream to send the data to Amazon S3.
D.
Configure an Amazon API Gateway API to send data to AWS Glue. Use AWS Lambda functions to transform the data. Use AWS Glue to send the data to Amazon S3.

Answer: C

Explanation:
C. By leveraging these services together, you can achieve a real-time data ingestion architecture with minimal operational overhead. The data flows from the API Gateway to the Kinesis data stream, undergoes transformations with Lambda, and is then sent to S3 via the Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream for storage.
A. This adds operational overhead as you need to handle EC2 management, scaling, and maintenance. It is less efficient compared to using a serverless solution like API Gateway.
B. It requires deploying and managing an EC2 to host the API and configuring Glue. This adds operational overhead, including EC2 management and potential scalability limitations.
D. It still requires managing and configuring Glue, which adds operational overhead. Additionally, it may not be the most efficient solution as Glue is primarily used for ETL scenarios, and in this case, real-time data transformation is required.

The company needs an API = Amazon API Gateway API 
A real-time data ingestion = Amazon Kinesis data stream
A process that transforms data = AWS Lambda functions
Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream to send the data to Amazon S3
A storage solution for the data = Amazon S3

Question 746
A company’s application is deployed on Amazon EC2 instances and uses AWS Lambda functions for an event-driven architecture. The company uses nonproduction development environments in a different AWS account to test new features before the company deploys the features to production.
The production instances show constant usage because of customers in different time zones. The company uses nonproduction instances only during business hours on weekdays. The company does not use the nonproduction instances on the weekends. The company wants to optimize the costs to run its application on AWS.
Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?
A.
Use On-Demand Instances for the production instances. Use Dedicated Hosts for the nonproduction instances on weekends only.
B.
Use Reserved Instances for the production instances and the nonproduction instances. Shut down the nonproduction instances when not in use.
C.
Use Compute Savings Plans for the production instances. Use On-Demand Instances for the nonproduction instances. Shut down the nonproduction instances when not in use.
D.
Use Dedicated Hosts for the production instances. Use EC2 Instance Savings Plans for the nonproduction instances.

Answer: C

Explanation:
https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/dedicated-hosts/
That already eliminates "A" and "D". No need to pay extra since there is no requirement for eligible software licences. 
B is INCORRECT = no need to use reserved instances for non-prod, since they will only be active during business hours during weekdays.

It eliminates the need to manually configure and maintain backup processes, making it easier to ensure data retention compliance without significant operational effort.

Question 757
A company has hired an external vendor to perform work in the company’s AWS account. The vendor uses an automated tool that is hosted in an AWS account that the vendor owns. The vendor does not have IAM access to the company’s AWS account. The company needs to grant the vendor access to the company’s AWS account.
Which solution will meet these requirements MOST securely?
A.
Create an IAM role in the company’s account to delegate access to the vendor’s IAM role. Attach the appropriate IAM policies to the role for the permissions that the vendor requires.
B.
Create an IAM user in the company’s account with a password that meets the password complexity requirements. Attach the appropriate IAM policies to the user for the permissions that the vendor requires.
C.
Create an IAM group in the company’s account. Add the automated tool’s IAM user from the vendor account to the group. Attach the appropriate IAM policies to the group for the permissions that the vendor requires.
D.
Create an IAM user in the company’s account that has a permission boundary that allows the vendor’s account. Attach the appropriate IAM policies to the user for the permissions that the vendor requires.

Answer: A

Explanation:
Least privilege principle: Using an IAM role instead of a user adheres to the least privilege principle as it only grants the vendor access to specific actions needed for their task, not full account access like a user would have.
No direct access to the company account: By delegating access through a role, the vendor's IAM user in their own account does not need to have direct login credentials to the company's AWS account, enhancing security.
Granular control: IAM policies attached to the role can be carefully crafted to provide only the necessary permissions for the vendor's automated tool, limiting potential damage in case of unauthorized access

For example (...), through AWS CloudFormation, the proactive control can prevent the creation of update of any S3 bucket that has public access enabled."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/aws-security-controls/proactive-controls.html

D
Proactive controls check whether resources are compliant with your company policies and objectives, before the resources are provisioned in your accounts.
Detective controls detect specific events when they occur and log the action in CloudTrail. 
Preventive controls prevent actions from occurring. 
Preventive controls are implemented with SCPs. Detective controls are implemented with AWS Config rules. Proactive controls are implemented with AWS CloudFormation hooks.

Question 767
A company is planning to use an Amazon DynamoDB table for data storage. The company is concerned about cost optimization. The table will not be used on most mornings. In the evenings, the read and write traffic will often be unpredictable. When traffic spikes occur, they will happen very quickly.
What should a solutions architect recommend?
A.
Create a DynamoDB table in on-demand capacity mode.
B.
Create a DynamoDB table with a global secondary index.
C.
Create a DynamoDB table with provisioned capacity and auto scaling.
D.
Create a DynamoDB table in provisioned capacity mode, and configure it as a global table.

Answer: A?C?

Explanation:
A
I have a feeling that the need for cost-optimisation is a distractor, and that people will jump on "provisioned with auto-scaling" without considering that provisioned capacity mode is not a good fit for the requirements. On-demand may end up cheaper as you avoid over- or underprovisioning capacity (when using auto-scaling, you still need to define a min and max). You can later switch capacity mode once your usage pattern becomes stable (if it ever does).
AWS say that on-demand capacity mode is a good fit for:
- Unpredictable workloads with sudden spikes (mentioned in the requirements)
- Frequently idle workloads (where the DB isn't used at all; The requirements say that it won't be used most mornings)
- Events with unknown traffic (which this is - traffic in the evenings is unpredictable)
Whereas provisioned capacity mode is used for:
- Predictable workloads
- Gradual ramps (no sudden spikes, as auto-scaling isn't instant and can cause traffic to get throttled)
- Events iwth known traffic
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/HowItWorks.ReadWriteCapacityMode.html

C
By choosing provisioned capacity, you can allocate a specific amount of read and write capacity units based on your expected usage during peak times. This helps in cost optimization as you only pay for the provisioned capacity, which can be adjusted according to your anticipated traffic.
Enabling auto scaling allows DynamoDB to automatically adjust the provisioned capacity up or down based on the actual usage. This is beneficial in handling quick traffic spikes without manual intervention and ensuring that the required capacity is available to handle increased load efficiently. Auto scaling helps to optimize costs by dynamically adjusting the capacity to match the demand, avoiding overprovisioning during periods of low usage.
A. Creating a DynamoDB table in on-demand capacity mode, may not be the most cost-effective solution in this scenario. On-demand capacity mode charges you based on the actual usage of read and write requests, which can be beneficial for sporadic or unpredictable workloads. However, it may not be the optimal choice if the table is not used on most mornings.

Question 772
A company wants to analyze and generate reports to track the usage of its mobile app. The app is popular and has a global user base. The company uses a custom report building program to analyze application usage.
The program generates multiple reports during the last week of each month. The program takes less than 10 minutes to produce each report. The company rarely uses the program to generate reports outside of the last week of each month The company wants to generate reports in the least amount of time when the reports are requested.
Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?
A.
Run the program by using Amazon EC2 On-Demand Instances. Create an Amazon EventBridge rule to start the EC2 instances when reports are requested. Run the EC2 instances continuously during the last week of each month.
B.
Run the program in AWS Lambda. Create an Amazon EventBridge rule to run a Lambda function when reports are requested.
C.

D.
Run the program by using Amazon EC2 Spot Instances. Create an Amazon EventBndge rule to start the EC2 instances when reports are requested. Run the EC2 instances continuously during the last week of each month.

Answer: B?C?

Explanation:
B
< 10 minutes means Lambda is OK

C
Option A and D are saying abount Running the EC2 instances countinously during the last week of each month which is not necessery from my understanding and will be not so cheap.
Option B - 10min per report and we have couple of reports. So it looks like program is running for at least 20 min so in theory Lambda is not useful here
Option C - ECS is allowing us to run Fargate which will allow to run program for more then 15 min, hence all reports which program is preparing should be created. I'm not sure but I think ECS API is allowing to run task on demand/request.

Question 778
A company is migrating a distributed application to AWS. The application serves variable workloads. The legacy platform consists of a primary server that coordinates jobs across multiple compute nodes. The company wants to modernize the application with a solution that maximizes resiliency and scalability.
How should a solutions architect design the architecture to meet these requirements?
A.
Configure an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue as a destination for the jobs. Implement the compute nodes with Amazon EC2 instances that are managed in an Auto Scaling group. Configure EC2 Auto Scaling to use scheduled scaling.
B.
Configure an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue as a destination for the jobs. Implement the compute nodes with Amazon EC2 instances that are managed in an Auto Scaling group. Configure EC2 Auto Scaling based on the size of the queue.
C.
Implement the primary server and the compute nodes with Amazon EC2 instances that are managed in an Auto Scaling group. Configure AWS CloudTrail as a destination for the jobs. Configure EC2 Auto Scaling based on the load on the primary server.
D.
Implement the primary server and the compute nodes with Amazon EC2 instances that are managed in an Auto Scaling group. Configure Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) as a destination for the jobs. Configure EC2 Auto Scaling based on the load on the compute nodes.

Answer: B

Explanation:
Configuring an Amazon SQS queue as a destination for the jobs, implementing compute nodes with EC2 instances managed in an Auto Scaling group, and configuring EC2 Auto Scaling based on the size of the queue is the most suitable solution. With this approach, the primary server can enqueue jobs into the SQS queue, and the compute nodes can dynamically scale based on the size of the queue. This ensures that the compute capacity adjusts according to the workload, maximizing resiliency and scalability. The SQS queue acts as a buffer, decoupling the primary server from the compute nodes and providing fault tolerance in case of failures or spikes in the workload.

Question 779
A company recently signed a contract with an AWS Managed Service Provider (MSP) Partner for help with an application migration initiative. A solutions architect needs ta share an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) from an existing AWS account with the MSP Partner's AWS account. The AMI is backed by Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) and uses an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer managed key to encrypt EBS volume snapshots.
What is the MOST secure way for the solutions architect to share the AMI with the MSP Partner's AWS account?
A.
Make the encrypted AMI and snapshots publicly available. Modify the key policy to allow the MSP Partner's AWS account to use the key.
B.
Modify the launchPermission property of the AMI. Share the AMI with the MSP Partner's AWS account only. Modify the key policy to allow the MSP Partner's AWS account to use the key.
C.
Modify the launchPermission property of the AMI. Share the AMI with the MSP Partner's AWS account only. Modify the key policy to trust a new KMS key that is owned by the MSP Partner for encryption.
D.
Export the AMI from the source account to an Amazon S3 bucket in the MSP Partner's AWS account, Encrypt the S3 bucket with a new KMS key that is owned by the MSP Partner. Copy and launch the AMI in the MSP Partner's AWS account.

Answer: B

Explanation:
By modifying the launchPermission property of the AMI and sharing it with the MSP Partner's account only, the solutions architect restricts access to the AMI and ensures that it is not publicly available.
Additionally, modifying the key policy to allow the MSP Partner's account to use KMS customer managed key used for encrypting the EBS snapshots ensures that the MSP Partner has the necessary permissions to access and use the key for decryption.

Question 780
A company needs to create an AWS Lambda function that will run in a VPC in the company's primary AWS account. The Lambda function needs to access files that the company stores in an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file system. The EFS file system is located in a secondary AWS account. As the company adds files to the file system, the solution must scale to meet the demand.
Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?
A.
Create a new EFS file system in the primary account. Use AWS DataSync to copy the contents of the original EFS file system to the new EFS file system.
B.
Create a VPC peering connection between the VPCs that are in the primary account and the secondary account.
C.
Create a second Lambda function in the secondary account that has a mount that is configured for the file system. Use the primary account's Lambda function to invoke the secondary account's Lambda function.
D.
Move the contents of the file system to a Lambda layer. Configure the Lambda layer's permissions to allow the company's secondary account to use the Lambda layer.

Answer: B

Explanation:
You can configure a function to mount an Amazon EFS file system in another AWS account. Before you mount the file system, you must ensure the following:
VPC peering must be configured, and appropriate routes must be added to the route tables in each VPC.

Question 781

Create an Amazon API Gateway API. Integrate the API with AWS Lambda to receive payment notifications from mobile devices. Invoke a Lambda function to validate payment notifications and send the notifications to the backend application. Deploy the backend application on Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS). Configure Amazon ECS with an AWS Fargate launch type.

Answer: D

Explanation:
I would go with Lambda function to do basic validation it should not take more then 15min hence Lambda is perfect for that job. Then we have information that backend processing application is long running and we need to make compute and memory adjustment, and everythink need to be automatic as company do not want to manage infrastucture. In that situation Fargate with ECS will be ideal as it can run background application for every paymant separetly we need only adjust amunt of resources in use. More payments more application running, mmore resources in use and oposite,

Question 786
A social media company has workloads that collect and process data. The workloads store the data in on-premises NFS storage. The data store cannot scale fast enough to meet the company’s expanding business needs. The company wants to migrate the current data store to AWS.
Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?
A.
Set up an AWS Storage Gateway Volume Gateway. Use an Amazon S3 Lifecycle policy to transition the data to the appropriate storage class.
B.
Set up an AWS Storage Gateway Amazon S3 File Gateway. Use an Amazon S3 Lifecycle policy to transition the data to the appropriate storage class.
C.
Use the Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) Standard-Infrequent Access (Standard-IA) storage class. Activate the infrequent access lifecycle policy.
D.
Use the Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) One Zone-Infrequent Access (One Zone-IA) storage class. Activate the infrequent access lifecycle policy.

Answer: B?D?

Explanation:
B
This solution meets the requirements most cost-effectively because it enables the company to migrate its on-premises NFS data store to AWS without changing the existing applications or workflows. AWS Storage Gateway is a hybrid cloud storage service that provides seamless and secure integration between on-premises and AWS storage. Amazon S3 File Gateway is a type of AWS Storage Gateway that provides a file interface to Amazon S3, with local caching for low-latency access. By setting up an Amazon S3 File Gateway, the company can store and retrieve files as objects in Amazon S3 using standard file protocols such as NFS.

D
Taking into consideration that we are talking about social media company probably storing a lot of quite small files i would say it cannot be Option A or B. 
For example
Amazon S3 File Gateway pricing
Storage Pricing 
Storage Pricing Stored and billed as Amazon S3 objects.
Request Pricing 
Data written to AWS storage by your gateway $0.01 per GB†
File storage in S3 Billed as Amazon S3 requests.
It can be quite expensive, especially when we will be working on small files.
I would go with EFS with OneZone-IA (option D) which should be less expensive taking into consideration that we are paying only for Storage and Data Transfer (per GB).
But to be honest we need more information to device which solution will be better.

Question 787
A company uses high concurrency AWS Lambda functions to process a constantly increasing number of messages in a message queue during marketing events. The Lambda functions use CPU intensive code to process the messages. The company wants to reduce the compute costs and to maintain service latency for its customers.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Configure reserved concurrency for the Lambda functions. Decrease the memory allocated to the Lambda functions.
B.
Configure reserved concurrency for the Lambda functions. Increase the memory according to AWS Compute Optimizer recommendations.
C.
Configure provisioned concurrency for the Lambda functions. Decrease the memory allocated to the Lambda functions.
D.
Configure provisioned concurrency for the Lambda functions. Increase the memory according to AWS Compute Optimizer recommendations.

Answer: B?D?

Explanation:
B
R eserved concurrency — It guarantees the maximum number of concurrent instances for the function which can be invoked. When a function has being with a reserved concurrency configuration then no other lambda function within the same AWS account and region can use that concurrency. There is no charge for configuring reserved concurrency for a function.
Provisioned concurrency — This concurrency initializes a requested number of execution environments so that they are prepared to respond immediately to your function’s invocations. Note that configuring provisioned concurrency incurs charges to your AWS account.

D
Also Lambda provisioned concurrency incure additionnal Account charges (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/provisioned-concurrency.html), it's the best option because it is stated:
- The company wants to reduce the compute costs and to maintain service latency for its customers.
So maintaining service latency while reducing compute cost is requested.
That being said, Lambda optimization is not a trivial task, that's why one should rely on AWS Compute Optimizer recommendations to analyze usage and find the best fit.

Question 788
A company runs its workloads on Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS). The container images that the ECS task definition uses need to be scanned for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs). New container images that are created also need to be scanned.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the FEWEST changes to the workloads?
A.
Use Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) as a private image repository to store the container images. Specify scan on push filters for the ECR basic scan.
B.
Store the container images in an Amazon S3 bucket. Use Amazon Macie to scan the images. Use an S3 Event Notification to initiate a Macie scan for every event with an s3:ObjectCreated:Put event type.
C.
Deploy the workloads to Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS). Use Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) as a private image repository. Specify scan on push filters for the ECR enhanced scan.
D.
Store the container images in an Amazon S3 bucket that has versioning enabled. Configure an S3 Event Notification for s3:ObjectCreated:* events to invoke an AWS Lambda function. Configure the Lambda function to initiate an Amazon Inspector scan.

Answer: A

Explanation:
need less workload changes and CVEs

Question 789
A company uses an AWS Batch job to run its end-of-day sales process. The company needs a serverless solution that will invoke a third-party reporting application when the AWS Batch job is successful. The reporting application has an HTTP API interface that uses username and password authentication.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Configure an Amazon EventBridge rule to match incoming AWS Batch job SUCCEEDED events. Configure the third-party API as an EventBridge API destination with a username and password. Set the API destination as the EventBridge rule target.
B.
Configure Amazon EventBridge Scheduler to match incoming AWS Batch job SUCCEEDED events. Configure an AWS Lambda function to invoke the third-party API by using a username and password. Set the Lambda function as the EventBridge rule target.
C.
Configure an AWS Batch job to publish job SUCCEEDED events to an Amazon API Gateway REST API. Configure an HTTP proxy integration on the API Gateway REST API to invoke the third-party API by using a username and password.
D.
Configure an AWS Batch job to publish job SUCCEEDED events to an Amazon API Gateway REST API. Configure a proxy integration on the API Gateway REST API to an AWS Lambda function. Configure the Lambda function to invoke the third-party API by using a username and password.

Answer: A

Explanation:
EventBridge Schedule will not work as it will allow us to "do something" per schedule. 
EventBridge rule will allow us to "do something" when event will occur.
I think there is no possibility to publish/send job "SUCCEEDED" to AMAZON API Gateway REST API or that we can do anykind of integration with AMAZON API Gateway, hence I would choose A

Question 790
A solutions architect is designing the cloud architecture for a new application being deployed on AWS. The process should run in parallel while adding and removing application nodes as needed based on the number of jobs to be processed. The processor application is stateless. The solutions architect must ensure that the application is loosely coupled and the job items are durably stored.
Which design should the solutions architect use?
A.
Create an Amazon SNS topic to send the jobs that need to be processed. Create an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) that consists of the processor application. Create a launch configuration that uses the AMI. Create an Auto Scaling group using the launch configuration. Set the scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to add and remove nodes based on CPU usage.
B.
Create an Amazon SQS queue to hold the jobs that need to be processed. Create an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) that consists of the processor application. Create a launch configuration that uses the AMI. Create an Auto Scaling group using the launch configuration. Set the scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to add and remove nodes based on network usage.
C.
Create an Amazon SQS queue to hold the jobs that need to be processed. Create an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) that consists of the processor application. Create a launch template that uses the AMI. Create an Auto Scaling group using the launch template. Set the scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to add and remove nodes based on the number of items in the SQS queue.
D.
Create an Amazon SNS topic to send the jobs that need to be processed. Create an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) that consists of the processor application. Create a launch template that uses the AMI. Create an Auto Scaling group using the launch template. Set the scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to add and remove nodes based on the number of messages published to the SNS topic.

Answer: C

Explanation:
This design follows the best practices for loosely coupled and scalable architecture. By using SQS, the jobs are durably stored in the queue, ensuring they are not lost. The processor application is stateless, which aligns with the design requirement. The AMI allows for consistent deployment of the application. The launch template and ASG facilitate the dynamic scaling of the application based on the number of items in the SQS, ensuring parallel processing of jobs.
Options A and D suggest using SNS, which is a publish/subscribe messaging service and may not provide the durability required for job storage.
Option B suggests using network usage as a scaling metric, which may not be directly related to the number of jobs to be processed. The number of items in the SQS provides a more accurate metric for scaling based on the workload.

Question 791
A company collects and processes data from a vendor. The vendor stores its data in an Amazon RDS for MySQL database in the vendor's own AWS account. The company’s VPC does not have an internet gateway, an AWS Direct Connect connection, or an AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection. The company needs to access the data that is in the vendor database.
Which solution will meet this requirement?
A.
Instruct the vendor to sign up for the AWS Hosted Connection Direct Connect Program. Use VPC peering to connect the company's VPC and the vendor's VPC.
B.
Configure a client VPN connection between the company's VPC and the vendor's VPC. Use VPC peering to connect the company's VPC and the vendor's VPC.
C.
Instruct the vendor to create a Network Load Balancer (NLB). Place the NLB in front of the Amazon RDS for MySQL database. Use AWS PrivateLink to integrate the company's VPC and the vendor's VPC.
D.
Use AWS Transit Gateway to integrate the company's VPC and the vendor's VPC. Use VPC peering to connect the company’s VPC and the vendor's VPC.

Answer: C

Explanation:
AWS PrivateLink enables you to connect to some AWS services, services hosted by other AWS accounts (referred to as endpoint services), and supported AWS Marketplace partner services, via private IP addresses in your VPC. The interface endpoints are created directly inside of your VPC, using elastic network interfaces and IP addresses in your VPC’s subnets. That means that VPC Security Groups can be used to manage access to the endpoints.

Question 792
A company wants to set up Amazon Managed Grafana as its visualization tool. The company wants to visualize data from its Amazon RDS database as one data source. The company needs a secure solution that will not expose the data over the internet.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Create an Amazon Managed Grafana workspace without a VPC. Create a public endpoint for the RDS database. Configure the public endpoint as a data source in Amazon Managed Grafana.
B.
Create an Amazon Managed Grafana workspace in a VPC. Create a private endpoint for the RDS database. Configure the private endpoint as a data source in Amazon Managed Grafana.
C.
Create an Amazon Managed Grafana workspace without a VPCreate an AWS PrivateLink endpoint to establish a connection between Amazon Managed Grafana and Amazon RDS. Set up Amazon RDS as a data source in Amazon Managed Grafana.
D.
Create an Amazon Managed Grafana workspace in a VPC. Create a public endpoint for the RDS database. Configure the public endpoint as a data source in Amazon Managed Grafana.

Answer: B?C?

Explanation:
B
Choice B or C could be resolved in this way:
B. Create an Amazon Managed Grafana workspace in a VPC
C. Create an Amazon Managed Grafana workspace without a VPC
As far as I know we cannot create workspace without VCP

C
After searching effort, I agree C is correct because AMG workspace can't include in VPC. When you have not configured a private VPC, and Amazon Managed Grafana is connecting to publicly accessible data sources, it connects to some AWS services in the same region via AWS PrivateLink. This includes services such as CloudWatch, Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus and AWS X-Ray. Traffic to those services does not flow via the public Internet.

Question 793
A company hosts a data lake on Amazon S3. The data lake ingests data in Apache Parquet format from various data sources. The company uses multiple transformation steps to prepare the ingested data. The steps include filtering of anomalies, normalizing of data to standard date and time values, and generation of aggregates for analyses.
The company must store the transformed data in S3 buckets that data analysts access. The company needs a prebuilt solution for data transformation that does not require code. The solution must provide data lineage and data profiling. The company needs to share the data transformation steps with employees throughout the company.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Configure an AWS Glue Studio visual canvas to transform the data. Share the transformation steps with employees by using AWS Glue jobs.
B.
Configure Amazon EMR Serverless to transform the data. Share the transformation steps with employees by using EMR Serverless jobs.
C.
Configure AWS Glue DataBrew to transform the data. Share the transformation steps with employees by using DataBrew recipes.
D.
Create Amazon Athena tables for the data. Write Athena SQL queries to transform the data. Share the Athena SQL queries with employees.

Answer: C

Explanation:
AWS Glue DataBrew is a visual data preparation tool that enables users to clean and normalize data without writing any code. Using DataBrew helps reduce the time it takes to prepare data for analytics and machine learning (ML) by up to 80 percent, compared to custom developed data preparation. You can choose from over 250 ready-made transformations to automate data preparation tasks, such as filtering anomalies, converting data to standard formats, and correcting invalid values.

Question 794
A solutions architect runs a web application on multiple Amazon EC2 instances that are in individual target groups behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB). Users can reach the application through a public website.
The solutions architect wants to allow engineers to use a development version of the website to access one specific development EC2 instance to test new features for the application. The solutions architect wants to use an Amazon Route 53 hosted zone to give the engineers access to the development instance. The solution must automatically route to the development instance even if the development instance is replaced.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Create an A Record for the development website that has the value set to the ALB. Create a listener rule on the ALB that forwards requests for the development website to the target group that contains the development instance.
B.
Recreate the development instance with a public IP address. Create an A Record for the development website that has the value set to the public IP address of the development instance.
C.
Create an A Record for the development website that has the value set to the ALB. Create a listener rule on the ALB to redirect requests for the development website to the public IP address of the development instance.
D.
Place all the instances in the same target group. Create an A Record for the development website. Set the value to the ALB. Create a listener rule on the ALB that forwards requests for the development website to the target group.

Answer: A

Explanation:
Both A and C look correct but with the C you pass through the ALB to be redirected to a public IP (so go outside) to come back again through this public IP which is not ideal.
The answer A is much cleaner and simplier with a dedicated target group and a listener rule pointing it.

By setting the A Record to point to the ALB, you ensure that even if the development instance is replaced, the DNS record will still direct traffic to the correct target group which contains the new development instance, maintaining accessibility for engineers.

Question 795
A company runs a container application on a Kubernetes cluster in the company's data center. The application uses Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) to communicate with a message queue. The data center cannot scale fast enough to meet the company’s expanding business needs. The company wants to migrate the workloads to AWS.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?
A.
Migrate the container application to Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS). Use Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) to retrieve the messages.
B.
Migrate the container application to Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS). Use Amazon MQ to retrieve the messages.
C.
Use highly available Amazon EC2 instances to run the application. Use Amazon MQ to retrieve the messages.
D.
Use AWS Lambda functions to run the application. Use Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) to retrieve the messages.

Answer: B

Explanation:
This question is a trap because A is definitely the answer for a Least overhead (ECS + SQS) and in a real life scenario could be good in 99% of cases.
However SQS do not implement AMQP (SQS is only a simple queueing system very basic) so we have to use Amazon MQ.
In terms of containers EKS will always be a better solution than a manual setup of Docker.
Good solution would have been ECS+AmazonMQ not given here
Lambda can work with containers, but since there are limitations like 15 minutes limit we can't really consider it as a good solution.
So B is the least bad solution.

Question 796
An online gaming company hosts its platform on Amazon EC2 instances behind Network Load Balancers (NLBs) across multiple AWS Regions. The NLBs can route requests to targets over the internet. The company wants to improve the customer playing experience by reducing end-to-end load time for its global customer base.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Create Application Load Balancers (ALBs) in each Region to replace the existing NLBs. Register the existing EC2 instances as targets for the ALBs in each Region.
B.
Configure Amazon Route 53 to route equally weighted traffic to the NLBs in each Region.
C.
Create additional NLBs and EC2 instances in other Regions where the company has large customer bases.
D.
Create a standard accelerator in AWS Global Accelerator. Configure the existing NLBs as target endpoints.

Answer: D

Explanation:
Acceleration for latency-sensitive applications
Many applications, especially in areas such as gaming, media, mobile apps, ad-tech, and financials, require very low latency for a great user experience. To improve the user experience, Global Accelerator directs user traffic to the application endpoint that is nearest to the client, which reduces internet latency and jitter. Global Accelerator routes traffic to the closest edge location by using Anycast, and then routes it to the closest regional endpoint over the AWS global network. Global Accelerator quickly reacts to changes in network performance to improve your users’ application performance.

Question 797
A company has an on-premises application that uses SFTP to collect financial data from multiple vendors. The company is migrating to the AWS Cloud. The company has created an application that uses Amazon S3 APIs to upload files from vendors.
Some vendors run their systems on legacy applications that do not support S3 APIs. The vendors want to continue to use SFTP-based applications to upload data. The company wants to use managed services for the needs of the vendors that use legacy applications.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?
A.
Create an AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) instance to replicate data from the storage of the vendors that use legacy applications to Amazon S3. Provide the vendors with the credentials to access the AWS DMS instance.
B.
Create an AWS Transfer Family endpoint for vendors that use legacy applications.
C.
Configure an Amazon EC2 instance to run an SFTP server. Instruct the vendors that use legacy applications to use the SFTP server to upload data.
D.
Configure an Amazon S3 File Gateway for vendors that use legacy applications to upload files to an SMB file share.

Answer: B

Explanation:
AWS Transfer Family is a fully managed service that allows you to set up SFTP, FTPS, and FTP endpoints for accessing Amazon S3 and Amazon EFS storage.
By creating an AWS Transfer Family endpoint, the company can provide vendors with the familiar SFTP interface to upload data directly to Amazon S3 without requiring them to make any changes to their legacy applications.
This solution eliminates the need for the company to manage and maintain additional infrastructure such as EC2 instances or file gateways.
AWS Transfer Family handles scalability, availability, and security, reducing operational overhead for the company.

Question 798
A marketing team wants to build a campaign for an upcoming multi-sport event. The team has news reports from the past five years in PDF format. The team needs a solution to extract insights about the content and the sentiment of the news reports. The solution must use Amazon Textract to process the news reports.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?
A.
Provide the extracted insights to Amazon Athena for analysis. Store the extracted insights and analysis in an Amazon S3 bucket.
B.
Store the extracted insights in an Amazon DynamoDB table. Use Amazon SageMaker to build a sentiment model.
C.
Provide the extracted insights to Amazon Comprehend for analysis. Save the analysis to an Amazon S3 bucket.
D.
Store the extracted insights in an Amazon S3 bucket. Use Amazon QuickSight to visualize and analyze the data.

Answer: C

Explanation:
Amazon Comprehend uses natural language processing (NLP) to extract insights about the content of documents. It develops insights by recognizing the entities, key phrases, language, sentiments, and other common elements in a document. Use Amazon Comprehend to create new products based on understanding the structure of documents. For example, using Amazon Comprehend you can search social networking feeds for mentions of products or scan an entire document repository for key phrases.

Question 799
A company's application runs on Amazon EC2 instances that are in multiple Availability Zones. The application needs to ingest real-time data from third-party applications.
The company needs a data ingestion solution that places the ingested raw data in an Amazon S3 bucket.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Create Amazon Kinesis data streams for data ingestion. Create Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery streams to consume the Kinesis data streams. Specify the S3 bucket as the destination of the delivery streams.
B.
Create database migration tasks in AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS). Specify replication instances of the EC2 instances as the source endpoints. Specify the S3 bucket as the target endpoint. Set the migration type to migrate existing data and replicate ongoing changes.
C.
Create and configure AWS DataSync agents on the EC2 instances. Configure DataSync tasks to transfer data from the EC2 instances to the S3 bucket.
D.
Create an AWS Direct Connect connection to the application for data ingestion. Create Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery streams to consume direct PUT operations from the application. Specify the S3 bucket as the destination of the delivery streams.

Answer: A

Explanation:
Kinesis Data Streams: This is designed for real-time data ingestion, which is exactly what the scenario requires.
Kinesis Data Firehose: This service can then be used to efficiently deliver the ingested data from Kinesis streams to an S3 bucket, fulfilling the need to store raw data in S3

Why the other options are incorrect:
B. AWS Database Migration Service (DMS):
DMS is primarily used for migrating databases, not for real-time data ingestion from third-party applications.
C. AWS DataSync:
While DataSync can transfer data to S3, it's not optimized for real-time data ingestion and would likely not be the best choice for this scenario.
D. AWS Direct Connect:
Direct Connect is used for dedicated private network connections between your on-premises network and AWS, not for real-time data ingestion from third-party applications.

Question 800
A company’s application is receiving data from multiple data sources. The size of the data varies and is expected to increase over time. The current maximum size is 700 KB. The data volume and data size continue to grow as more data sources are added.
The company decides to use Amazon DynamoDB as the primary database for the application. A solutions architect needs to identify a solution that handles the large data sizes.
Which solution will meet these requirements in the MOST operationally efficient way?
A.
Create an AWS Lambda function to filter the data that exceeds DynamoDB item size limits. Store the larger data in an Amazon DocumentDB (with MongoDB compatibility) database.
B.
Store the large data as objects in an Amazon S3 bucket. In a DynamoDB table, create an item that has an attribute that points to the S3 URL of the data.
C.
Split all incoming large data into a collection of items that have the same partition key. Write the data to a DynamoDB table in a single operation by using the BatchWriteItem API operation.
D.
Create an AWS Lambda function that uses gzip compression to compress the large objects as they are written to a DynamoDB table.

Answer: B

Explanation:
Compresion of data in DynamoDB is a good idea especially for text data link from forum, but to do that we do not need AWS Lambda if I'm not wrong.
In other head Storing big object on S3 and seving URL to it in DynamoDB is one of best practices mentioned by Amazon. Hence we do not know what kind of data we are storing in DB and how big objects will be in the future option B looks like the best solution.

Question 801
A company hosts its web applications in the AWS Cloud. The company configures Elastic Load Balancers to use certificates that are imported into AWS Certificate Manager (ACM). The company's security team must be notified 30 days before the expiration of each certificate.
What should a solutions architect recommend to meet this requirement?
A.
Add a rule in ACM to publish a custom message to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic every day, beginning 30 days before any certificate will expire.
B.
Create an AWS Config rule that checks for certificates that will expire within 30 days. Configure Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) to invoke a custom alert by way of Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) when AWS Config reports a noncompliant resource.
C.
Use AWS Trusted Advisor to check for certificates that will expire within 30 days. Create an Amazon CloudWatch alarm that is based on Trusted Advisor metrics for check status changes. Configure the alarm to send a custom alert by way of Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS).
D.
Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule to detect any certificates that will expire within 30 days. Configure the rule to invoke an AWS Lambda function. Configure the Lambda function to send a custom alert by way of Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS).

Answer: D

Explanation:
Option D is the best answer because it involves using Amazon EventBridge (formerly known as Amazon CloudWatch Events), which is a fully managed event bus that makes it easy to set up and run event-driven applications. You can use EventBridge to create rules that trigger based on the occurrence of an event, such as the expiration of a certificate. By creating a rule that detects any certificates that will expire within 30 days, you can ensure that the security team is notified in a timely manner.
In addition, Option D involves using an AWS Lambda function, which is a compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. You can configure the Lambda function to send a custom alert by way of Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) when it is triggered by the EventBridge rule. This allows you to automate the process of sending notifications to the security team.

***WRONG***
Option A is not a viable solution because it would involve sending a daily message to the Amazon SNS topic, which would not be necessary or efficient.
Option B is not the best choice because it involves using AWS Config, which is designed for monitoring and recording resource configurations. It is not well suited for monitoring the expiration of certificates.
Option C is not a good fit because it involves using AWS Trusted Advisor, which is a tool that helps you optimize your AWS resources. It is not designed for monitoring the expiration of certificates.

Question 802
A company is migrating a legacy application from an on-premises data center to AWS. The application relies on hundreds of cron jobs that run between 1 and 20 minutes on different recurring schedules throughout the day.
The company wants a solution to schedule and run the cron jobs on AWS with minimal refactoring. The solution must support running the cron jobs in response to an event in the future.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Create a container image for the cron jobs. Use Amazon EventBridge Scheduler to create a recurring schedule. Run the cron job tasks as AWS Lambda functions.
B.
Create a container image for the cron jobs. Use AWS Batch on Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) with a scheduling policy to run the cron jobs.
C.
Create a container image for the cron jobs. Use Amazon EventBridge Scheduler to create a recurring schedule. Run the cron job tasks on AWS Fargate.
D.
Create a container image for the cron jobs. Create a workflow in AWS Step Functions that uses a Wait state to run the cron jobs at a specified time. Use the RunTask action to run the cron job tasks on AWS Fargate.

Answer: C

Explanation:
Lambda has 15 mins limit, so A is out.
B works, but you have to run highly-available virtual machines or containers waiting for the event to happen.
C is the best answer in this question, with AWS Fargate allows you to pay for only what you use and free you from provisioning, configuring, and scaling clusters of Amazon EC2 instances.

Question 803
A company uses Salesforce. The company needs to load existing data and ongoing data changes from Salesforce to Amazon Redshift for analysis. The company does not want the data to travel over the public internet.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST development effort?
A.
Establish a VPN connection from the VPC to Salesforce. Use AWS Glue DataBrew to transfer data.
B.
Establish an AWS Direct Connect connection from the VPC to Salesforce. Use AWS Glue DataBrew to transfer data.
C.
Create an AWS PrivateLink connection in the VPC to Salesforce. Use Amazon AppFlow to transfer data.
D.
Create a VPC peering connection to Salesforce. Use Amazon AppFlow to transfer data.

Answer: C

Explanation:
To connect your own VPC with third-party VPC we need to use ProvateLink.
AWS PrivateLink is a highly available, scalable technology that you can use to privately connect your VPC to services as if they were in your VPC. You do not need to use an internet gateway, NAT device, public IP address, AWS Direct Connect connection, or AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection to allow communication with the service from your private subnets. Therefore, you control the specific API endpoints, sites, and services that are reachable from your VPC.

Question 804
A company recently migrated its application to AWS. The application runs on Amazon EC2 Linux instances in an Auto Scaling group across multiple Availability Zones. The application stores data in an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file system that uses EFS Standard-Infrequent Access storage. The application indexes the company's files. The index is stored in an Amazon RDS database.
The company needs to optimize storage costs with some application and services changes.
Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?
A.
Create an Amazon S3 bucket that uses an Intelligent-Tiering lifecycle policy. Copy all files to the S3 bucket. Update the application to use Amazon S3 API to store and retrieve files.
B.
Deploy Amazon FSx for Windows File Server file shares. Update the application to use CIFS protocol to store and retrieve files.
C.
Deploy Amazon FSx for OpenZFS file system shares. Update the application to use the new mount point to store and retrieve files.
D.
Create an Amazon S3 bucket that uses S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval. Copy all files to the S3 bucket. Update the application to use Amazon S3 API to store and retrieve files as standard retrievals.

Answer: A

Explanation:
Since the company is ok with "some application and services changes", then A is definitely the most cost-effective option.
D can take up to few hours to complete retrievals.

Question 805
A robotics company is designing a solution for medical surgery. The robots will use advanced sensors, cameras, and AI algorithms to perceive their environment and to complete surgeries.
The company needs a public load balancer in the AWS Cloud that will ensure seamless communication with backend services. The load balancer must be capable of routing traffic based on the query strings to different target groups. The traffic must also be encrypted.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Use a Network Load Balancer with a certificate attached from AWS Certificate Manager (ACM). Use query parameter-based routing.
B.
Use a Gateway Load Balancer. Import a generated certificate in AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM). Attach the certificate to the load balancer. Use HTTP path-based routing.
C.
Use an Application Load Balancer with a certificate attached from AWS Certificate Manager (ACM). Use query parameter-based routing.
D.
Use a Network Load Balancer. Import a generated certificate in AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM). Attach the certificate to the load balancer. Use query parameter-based routing.

Answer: C

Explanation:
I was thinking that it will be network LB but after checks it occurs that only Application LB is able to redirect/forward traffic based on query string. and for encrypted traffic ACM is needed
We recommend that you create certificates for your load balancer using AWS Certificate Manager (ACM). ACM supports RSA certificates with 2048, 3072, and 4096-bit key lengths, and all ECDSA certificates. ACM integrates with Elastic Load Balancing so that you can deploy the certificate on your load balancer. For more information, see the AWS Certificate Manager User Guide.

Question 806
A company has an application that runs on a single Amazon EC2 instance. The application uses a MySQL database that runs on the same EC2 instance. The company needs a highly available and automatically scalable solution to handle increased traffic.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Deploy the application to EC2 instances that run in an Auto Scaling group behind an Application Load Balancer. Create an Amazon Redshift cluster that has multiple MySQL-compatible nodes.
B.
Deploy the application to EC2 instances that are configured as a target group behind an Application Load Balancer. Create an Amazon RDS for MySQL cluster that has multiple instances.
C.
Deploy the application to EC2 instances that run in an Auto Scaling group behind an Application Load Balancer. Create an Amazon Aurora Serverless MySQL cluster for the database layer.
D.
Deploy the application to EC2 instances that are configured as a target group behind an Application Load Balancer. Create an Amazon ElastiCache for Redis cluster that uses the MySQL connector.

Answer: C

Explanation:
Option B: 
Target Group: it doesn't inherently imply automatic scaling. You would need to manage scaling separately, either manually or through other mechanisms like scheduled actions.
Option C: 
Auto Scaling Group: This ensures that the EC2 instances can automatically scale in or out based on traffic and demand. 
"The company needs a highly available and automatically scalable solution" => C

Question 807
A company is planning to migrate data to an Amazon S3 bucket. The data must be encrypted at rest within the S3 bucket. The encryption key must be rotated automatically every year.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?
A.
Migrate the data to the S3 bucket. Use server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3). Use the built-in key rotation behavior of SSE-S3 encryption keys.
B.
Create an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer managed key. Enable automatic key rotation. Set the S3 bucket's default encryption behavior to use the customer managed KMS key. Migrate the data to the S3 bucket.
C.
Create an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer managed key. Set the S3 bucket's default encryption behavior to use the customer managed KMS key. Migrate the data to the S3 bucket. Manually rotate the KMS key every year.
D.
Use customer key material to encrypt the data. Migrate the data to the S3 bucket. Create an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key without key material. Import the customer key material into the KMS key. Enable automatic key rotation.

Answer: B

Explanation:
Looks like key rotation is only possible when KMS is in use. If we will use AWS managed keys Rotation is forced and if we will not provide any specifications regarding rotation time for key, KMS will rotate key every 365days.

Question 808
A company is migrating applications from an on-premises Microsoft Active Directory that the company manages to AWS. The company deploys the applications in multiple AWS accounts. The company uses AWS Organizations to manage the accounts centrally.
The company's security team needs a single sign-on solution across all the company's AWS accounts. The company must continue to manage users and groups that are in the on-premises Active Directory.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Create an Enterprise Edition Active Directory in AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory. Configure the Active Directory to be the identity source for AWS IAM Identity Center.
B.
Enable AWS IAM Identity Center. Configure a two-way forest trust relationship to connect the company's self-managed Active Directory with IAM Identity Center by using AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory.
C.
Use AWS Directory Service and create a two-way trust relationship with the company's self-managed Active Directory.
D.
Deploy an identity provider (IdP) on Amazon EC2. Link the IdP as an identity source within AWS IAM Identity Center.

Answer: B

Explanation:
AWS Directory Service lets you run Microsoft Active Directory (AD) as a managed service. AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory, also referred to as AWS Managed Microsoft AD, is powered by Windows Server 2019.
With AWS Managed Microsoft AD, you can run directory-aware workloads in the AWS Cloud, including Microsoft SharePoint and custom .NET and SQL Server-based applications. You can also configure a trust relationship between AWS Managed Microsoft AD in the AWS Cloud and your existing on-premises Microsoft Active Directory, providing users and groups with access to resources in either domain, using AWS IAM Identity Center.

Question 809
A company is planning to deploy its application on an Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL Serverless v2 cluster. The application will receive large amounts of traffic. The company wants to optimize the storage performance of the cluster as the load on the application increases.
Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?
A.
Configure the cluster to use the Aurora Standard storage configuration.
B.
Configure the cluster storage type as Provisioned IOPS.
C.
Configure the cluster storage type as General Purpose.
D.
Configure the cluster to use the Aurora I/O-Optimized storage configuration.

Answer: D

Explanation:
For Aurora we have 2 storage type/options: 
A - Standard 
B -- I/O-Optimized 
hence answers B and C options are incorrect.
Because customer inform us that there will be a big amount of traffic for their application I would go with I/O-Optimized. Maybe we are giving more $$ per GB-month but we are not paing for I/O operations/request.
https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/pricing/
In general question is not precise and it is hard to say which option will be more beneficial (cost effective)

Question 811
A company uses an Amazon S3 bucket as its data lake storage platform. The S3 bucket contains a massive amount of data that is accessed randomly by multiple teams and hundreds of applications. The company wants to reduce the S3 storage costs and provide immediate availability for frequently accessed objects.
What is the MOST operationally efficient solution that meets these requirements?
A.
Create an S3 Lifecycle rule to transition objects to the S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class.
B.
Store objects in Amazon S3 Glacier. Use S3 Select to provide applications with access to the data.
C.
Use data from S3 storage class analysis to create S3 Lifecycle rules to automatically transition objects to the S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) storage class.
D.
Transition objects to the S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) storage class. Create an AWS Lambda function to transition objects to the S3 Standard storage class when they are accessed by an application.

Answer: A

Explanation:
The Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class automatically stores objects in three access tiers. One tier is optimized for frequent access, one lower-cost tier is optimized for infrequent access, and another very low-cost tier is optimized for rarely accessed data. For a low monthly object monitoring and automation charge, S3 Intelligent-Tiering monitors access patterns and automatically moves objects to the Infrequent Access tier when they haven't been accessed for 30 consecutive days. After 90 days of no access, the objects are moved to the Archive Instant Access tier without performance impact or operational overhead.

Question 812
A company's dynamic website is hosted using on-premises servers in the United States. The company is launching its product in Europe, and it wants to optimize site loading times for new European users. The site's backend must remain in the United States. The product is being launched in a few days, and an immediate solution is needed.
What should the solutions architect recommend?
A.
Launch an Amazon EC2 instance in us-east-1 and migrate the site to it.
B.
Move the website to Amazon S3. Use Cross-Region Replication between Regions.
C.
Use Amazon CloudFront with a custom origin pointing to the on-premises servers.
D.
Use an Amazon Route 53 geoproximity routing policy pointing to on-premises servers.

Answer: C

Explanation:
C. This solution leverages the global network of CloudFront edge locations to cache and serve the website's static content from the edge locations closest to the European users.
A. Hosting the website in a single region would still result in increased latency for European users accessing the site.
B. Moving the website to S3 and implementing Cross-Region Replication would distribute the website's content across multiple regions, including Europe. S3 is primarily used for static content hosting, and it does not provide server-side processing capabilities necessary for dynamic website functionality.
D. Using a geoproximity routing policy in Route 53 would allow you to direct traffic to the on-premises servers based on the geographic location of the users. However, this option does not optimize site loading times for European users as it still requires them to access the website from the on-premises servers in the United States. It does not leverage the benefits of content caching and edge locations for improved performance.

Question 813
A company has 5 TB of datasets. The datasets consist of 1 million user profiles and 10 million connections. The user profiles have connections as many-to-many relationships. The company needs a performance efficient way to find mutual connections up to five levels.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Use an Amazon S3 bucket to store the datasets. Use Amazon Athena to perform SQL JOIN queries to find connections.
B.

A.
Implement a client VPN.
B.
Implement AWS Direct Connect.
C.
Implement a bastion host on Amazon EC2.
D.
Implement an AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection.

Answer: D

Explanation:
Not A because for individual conenction not company
Not B because overkill, usually for high bandwidth, but qns clearly stated no need for high bandwidth and handle small traffic
Not C because bastion host for remote access
D because ideal for small amt of traffic

Question 815
A company has an on-premises SFTP file transfer solution. The company is migrating to the AWS Cloud to scale the file transfer solution and to optimize costs by using Amazon S3. The company's employees will use their credentials for the on-premises Microsoft Active Directory (AD) to access the new solution. The company wants to keep the current authentication and file access mechanisms.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?
A.
Configure an S3 File Gateway. Create SMB file shares on the file gateway that use the existing Active Directory to authenticate.
B.
Configure an Auto Scaling group with Amazon EC2 instances to run an SFTP solution. Configure the group to scale up at 60% CPU utilization.
C.
Create an AWS Transfer Family server with SFTP endpoints. Choose the AWS Directory Service option as the identity provider. Use AD Connector to connect the on-premises Active Directory.
D.
Create an AWS Transfer Family SFTP endpoint. Configure the endpoint to use the AWS Directory Service option as the identity provider to connect to the existing Active Directory.

Answer: C

Explanation:
1. Create one or more AWS Managed Microsoft AD directories using the AWS Directory Service console.
2. Use the Transfer Family console to create a **server** that uses **AWS Managed Microsoft AD** as its identity provider.
3. Add access from one or more of your AWS Directory Service groups.
4. Although not required, we recommend that you test and verify user access.

We need Transfer Family SFTP enabled server (with SFTP endpoint). Additiionally AWS Directory Service with AD connector to reach on-premises AD for authentication and authorization.

Question 816
A company is designing an event-driven order processing system. Each order requires multiple validation steps after the order is created. An idempotent AWS Lambda function performs each validation step. Each validation step is independent from the other validation steps. Individual validation steps need only a subset of the order event information.
The company wants to ensure that each validation step Lambda function has access to only the information from the order event that the function requires. The components of the order processing system should be loosely coupled to accommodate future business changes.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Create an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue for each validation step. Create a new Lambda function to transform the order data to the format that each validation step requires and to publish the messages to the appropriate SQS queues. Subscribe each validation step Lambda function to its corresponding SQS queue.
B.
Create an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic. Subscribe the validation step Lambda functions to the SNS topic. Use message body filtering to send only the required data to each subscribed Lambda function.
C.
Create an Amazon EventBridge event bus. Create an event rule for each validation step. Configure the input transformer to send only the required data to each target validation step Lambda function.
D.
Create an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Create a new Lambda function to subscribe to the SQS queue and to transform the order data to the format that each validation step requires. Use the new Lambda function to perform synchronous invocations of the validation step Lambda functions in parallel on separate threads.

Answer: C

Explanation:
- With SNS, message filtering allows you to control which subscribers receive messages based on attributes. However, the entire message is sent to each subscribed Lambda function; only those that match the filter criteria are processed.
EventBridge and Input Transformation
- EventBridge enables you to define rules that transform or modify events before they reach their targets. This allows you to customize the event payload, ensuring each validation step receives only the relevant information.
"The company wants to ensure that each validation step Lambda function has access to only the information from the order event that the function requires."
Therefore, C is the answer.

Question 817
A company is migrating a three-tier application to AWS. The application requires a MySQL database. In the past, the application users reported poor application performance when creating new entries. These performance issues were caused by users generating different real-time reports from the application during working hours.
Which solution will improve the performance of the application when it is moved to AWS?
A.
Import the data into an Amazon DynamoDB table with provisioned capacity. Refactor the application to use DynamoDB for reports.
B.
Create the database on a compute optimized Amazon EC2 instance. Ensure compute resources exceed the on-premises database.
C.
Create an Amazon Aurora MySQL Multi-AZ DB cluster with multiple read replicas. Configure the application to use the reader endpoint for reports.
D.
Create an Amazon Aurora MySQL Multi-AZ DB cluster. Configure the application to use the backup instance of the cluster as an endpoint for the reports.

Answer: C

Explanation:
Any replica of Amazon Aurora Db will be read-only replica (even backup one). Option C is better then D because we will use multiple replicas which when used will signicially allow to increase performance for creating reports. In the same time no write operation should be affected.
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/AuroraMySQL.Replication.html

Question 818
A company is expanding a secure on-premises network to the AWS Cloud by using an AWS Direct Connect connection. The on-premises network has no direct internet access. An application that runs on the on-premises network needs to use an Amazon S3 bucket.
Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?
A.
Create a public virtual interface (VIF). Route the AWS traffic over the public VIF.
B.
Create a VPC and a NAT gateway. Route the AWS traffic from the on-premises network to the NAT gateway.
C.
Create a VPC and an Amazon S3 interface endpoint. Route the AWS traffic from the on-premises network to the S3 interface endpoint.
D.
Create a VPC peering connection between the on-premises network and Direct Connect. Route the AWS traffic over the peering connection.

Answer: A?C?

Explanation:
A
1) I need to connect to public services only, thus public VIF will be enough.
2) Interface endpoints is charged per hour, not cost effective.

C
Amazon S3 interface endpoint seems to be the best and only option as we are forced to use Private IP addressation.
Interface endpoints for Amazon S3
Your network traffic remains on the AWS network.
Use private IP addresses from your VPC to access Amazon S3
Require endpoint-specific Amazon S3 DNS names
Allow access from on premises
Allow access from a VPC in another AWS Region by using VPC peering or AWS Transit Gateway

Question 819
A company serves its website by using an Auto Scaling group of Amazon EC2 instances in a single AWS Region. The website does not require a database.
The company is expanding, and the company's engineering team deploys the website to a second Region. The company wants to distribute traffic across both Regions to accommodate growth and for disaster recovery purposes. The solution should not serve traffic from a Region in which the website is unhealthy.
Which policy or resource should the company use to meet these requirements?
A.
An Amazon Route 53 simple routing policy
B.
An Amazon Route 53 multivalue answer routing policy
C.
An Application Load Balancer in one Region with a target group that specifies the EC2 instance IDs from both Regions
D.
An Application Load Balancer in one Region with a target group that specifies the IP addresses of the EC2 instances from both Regions

Answer: B

Explanation:
53 with multivalue is the best option for this case
Multivalue answer routing lets you configure Amazon Route 53 to return multiple values, such as IP addresses for your web servers, in response to DNS queries. You can specify multiple values for almost any record, but multivalue answer routing also lets you check the health of each resource, so Route 53 returns only values for healthy resources. It's not a substitute for a load balancer, but the ability to return multiple health-checkable IP addresses is a way to use DNS to improve availability and load balancing.

Question 820
A company runs its applications on Amazon EC2 instances that are backed by Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS). The EC2 instances run the most recent Amazon Linux release. The applications are experiencing availability issues when the company's employees store and retrieve files that are 25 GB or larger. The company needs a solution that does not require the company to transfer files between EC2 instances. The files must be available across many EC2 instances and across multiple Availability Zones.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Migrate all the files to an Amazon S3 bucket. Instruct the employees to access the files from the S3 bucket.
B.
Take a snapshot of the existing EBS volume. Mount the snapshot as an EBS volume across the EC2 instances. Instruct the employees to access the files from the EC2 instances.
C.
Mount an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file system across all the EC2 instances. Instruct the employees to access the files from the EC2 instances.
D.
Create an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) from the EC2 instances. Configure new EC2 instances from the AMI that use an instance store volume. Instruct the employees to access the files from the EC2 instances.

Answer: C

Explanation:
"files must be available across many EC2 instances" means need some sort of shared system
immediately i look for EFS

Question 821
A company is running a highly sensitive application on Amazon EC2 backed by an Amazon RDS database. Compliance regulations mandate that all personally identifiable information (PII) be encrypted at rest.
Which solution should a solutions architect recommend to meet this requirement with the LEAST amount of changes to the infrastructure?
A.
Deploy AWS Certificate Manager to generate certificates. Use the certificates to encrypt the database volume.
B.
Deploy AWS CloudHSM, generate encryption keys, and use the keys to encrypt database volumes.
C.
Configure SSL encryption using AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) keys to encrypt database volumes.
D.
Configure Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) encryption and Amazon RDS encryption with AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) keys to encrypt instance and database volumes.

Answer: D

Explanation:
- Option D requires the least infrastructure modification as it leverages existing features of EBS and RDS to enable encryption with KMS keys.
- This is the most straightforward way to meet the compliance requirement without significant changes to the existing setup.

Question 822
A company runs an AWS Lambda function in private subnets in a VPC. The subnets have a default route to the internet through an Amazon EC2 NAT instance. The Lambda function processes input data and saves its output as an object to Amazon S3.
Intermittently, the Lambda function times out while trying to upload the object because of saturated traffic on the NAT instance's network. The company wants to access Amazon S3 without traversing the internet.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Replace the EC2 NAT instance with an AWS managed NAT gateway.
B.
Increase the size of the EC2 NAT instance in the VPC to a network optimized instance type.
C.
Provision a gateway endpoint for Amazon S3 in the VPUpdate the route tables of the subnets accordingly.
D.
Provision a transit gateway. Place transit gateway attachments in the private subnets where the Lambda function is running.

Answer: C

Explanation:
By provisioning a gateway endpoint for Amazon S3 in the VPC, you enable the Lambda function running in the private subnets to access S3 directly without needing to go through the NAT instance or traverse the internet. This solution helps alleviate the network congestion issue and reduces latency since the traffic between Lambda and S3 stays within the AWS network. Additionally, updating the route tables of the subnets to route S3 traffic through the gateway endpoint ensures that the Lambda function can seamlessly communicate with S3 without encountering timeouts caused by network saturation on the NAT instance.
	
Question 823
A company wants to reduce the cost of its existing three-tier web architecture. The web, application, and database servers are running on Amazon EC2 instances for the development, test, and production environments. The EC2 instances average 30% CPU utilization during peak hours and 10% CPU utilization during non-peak hours.
The production EC2 instances run 24 hours a day. The development and test EC2 instances run for at least 8 hours each day. The company plans to implement automation to stop the development and test EC2 instances when they are not in use.
Which EC2 instance purchasing solution will meet the company's requirements MOST cost-effectively?
A.
Use Spot Instances for the production EC2 instances. Use Reserved Instances for the development and test EC2 instances.
B.
Use Reserved Instances for the production EC2 instances. Use On-Demand Instances for the development and test EC2 instances.
C.
Use Spot blocks for the production EC2 instances. Use Reserved Instances for the development and test EC2 instances.
D.
Use On-Demand Instances for the production EC2 instances. Use Spot blocks for the development and test EC2 instances.

Answer: B

Explanation:
Option B, would indeed be the most cost-effective solution. Reserved Instances provide cost savings for instances that run consistently, such as the production environment in this case, while On-Demand Instances offer flexibility and are suitable for instances with variable usage patterns like the development and test environments. This combination ensures cost optimization based on the specific requirements and usage patterns described in the question.

Question 824
A news company that has reporters all over the world is hosting its broadcast system on AWS. The reporters send live broadcasts to the broadcast system. The reporters use software on their phones to send live streams through the Real Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP).
A solutions architect must design a solution that gives the reporters the ability to send the highest quality streams. The solution must provide accelerated TCP connections back to the broadcast system.
What should the solutions architect use to meet these requirements?
A.
Amazon CloudFront
B.
AWS Global Accelerator
C.
AWS Client VPN
D.
Amazon EC2 instances and AWS Elastic IP addresses

Answer: B

Explanation:
We can eliminate C and D, A is for Web apps hence B should be ok

Looks like the question is very old, but before the right answer was Cloudfront. Now AWS says that "All RTMP workloads should begin migrating to a standard CloudFront Web distribution and use one of several HTTP streaming protocols such as HTTP Live Streaming (HLS), Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH), Microsoft Smooth Streaming (MSS), or HTTP Dynamic Streaming (HDS)." https://repost.aws/questions/QUoUZgHZh7SEWlnQUPlBmVNQ/announcement-rtmp-support-discontinuing-on-december-31-2020

Question 825
A company uses Amazon EC2 instances and Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) to run its self-managed database. The company has 350 TB of data spread across all EBS volumes. The company takes daily EBS snapshots and keeps the snapshots for 1 month. The daily change rate is 5% of the EBS volumes.
Because of new regulations, the company needs to keep the monthly snapshots for 7 years. The company needs to change its backup strategy to comply with the new regulations and to ensure that data is available with minimal administrative effort.
Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?
A.
Keep the daily snapshot in the EBS snapshot standard tier for 1 month. Copy the monthly snapshot to Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive with a 7-year retention period.
B.
Continue with the current EBS snapshot policy. Add a new policy to move the monthly snapshot to Amazon EBS Snapshots Archive with a 7-year retention period.
C.
Keep the daily snapshot in the EBS snapshot standard tier for 1 month. Keep the monthly snapshot in the standard tier for 7 years. Use incremental snapshots.
D.
Keep the daily snapshot in the EBS snapshot standard tier. Use EBS direct APIs to take snapshots of all the EBS volumes every month. Store the snapshots in an Amazon S3 bucket in the Infrequent Access tier for 7 years.

Answer: A?B?

Explanation:
A
How much does EBS snapshots archive cost?
Pricing and billing. Archived snapshots are billed at a rate of $0.0125 per GB-month. For example, if you archive a 100 GiB snapshot, you are billed $1.25 (100 GiB * $0.0125) per month.
What is the cost of Glacier?
Even though uploading data to Amazon S3 Glacier is free, there is a pricing method for upload requests, which is $0.03 per 1,000 requests. Transferring data out of S3 Glacier to the same region is free; however, there is a cost for transferring data to a different region.
• $0.0036 per GB / Month

B
The problem is that we need to choose best solution which is most cost-effective and have minimal administrative effort.
Glacier is the best choice for 1st look, but there is one problem with that solution. From what I know there is no easy way to copy from EBS to Glacier and additionally curent strategy is to make incremental snapshots. To copy file from EBS to (s3) Glacier we would need to run linux to which we will mount EBS and we will need copy everything to S3 and then move to glaceir deep archive. And what is more you will have only incremental snapshot. Hence every solution which will say copy/move to S3 is not minimal administrative effort. Not mentionig that you will not have full snapshot

Question 826
A company runs an application on several Amazon EC2 instances that store persistent data on an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file system. The company needs to replicate the data to another AWS Region by using an AWS managed service solution.
Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?
A.
Use the EFS-to-EFS backup solution to replicate the data to an EFS file system in another Region.
B.
Run a nightly script to copy data from the EFS file system to an Amazon S3 bucket. Enable S3 Cross-Region Replication on the S3 bucket.
C.
Create a VPC in another Region. Establish a cross-Region VPC peer. Run a nightly rsync to copy data from the original Region to the new Region.
D.
Use AWS Backup to create a backup plan with a rule that takes a daily backup and replicates it to another Region. Assign the EFS file system resource to the backup plan.

Answer: D

Explanation:
I think the most cost effective would solution presented in C, but hence in question it's clearly wrote that we should use AWS Managed Services Solution, hence I think we have no other choice then to choose AWS backup (Option D)

C.
Migrate the web application to Amazon EC2 instances that run in an Auto Scaling group across two Availability Zones behind an Application Load Balancer. Migrate the database to Amazon RDS with Multi-AZ deployment.
D.
Migrate the web application to three Amazon EC2 instances across three Availability Zones behind an Application Load Balancer. Migrate the database to three EC2 instances across three Availability Zones.

Answer: C

Explanation:
I would de-couple as many elements as possible with appopriate redundancy (HA), hence Auto-Scale in 2 AZ for EC2, Database in Multi-AZ and ALB infront of EC2. It will allow to increase amount of servers in case of need and will prevent from service unavailability in case if something fail ;)

Question 828
A company has an on-premises business application that generates hundreds of files each day. These files are stored on an SMB file share and require a low-latency connection to the application servers. A new company policy states all application-generated files must be copied to AWS. There is already a VPN connection to AWS.
The application development team does not have time to make the necessary code modifications to move the application to AWS.
Which service should a solutions architect recommend to allow the application to copy files to AWS?
A.
Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS)
B.
Amazon FSx for Windows File Server
C.
AWS Snowball
D.
AWS Storage Gateway

Answer: D

Explanation:
AWS Storage Gateway provides a set of hybrid cloud storage services that offer on-premises access to virtually unlimited cloud storage. The File Gateway configuration of AWS Storage Gateway supports the SMB protocol (and NFS), enabling on-premises applications to seamlessly store and retrieve files in Amazon S3 using existing file system protocols. It fits perfectly for applications that need to continue operating without modification, while also adhering to the new policy of copying files to AWS.
Given these descriptions, Option D (AWS Storage Gateway) is the recommended service. It allows for a smooth integration by maintaining the existing SMB file-sharing capabilities and connects seamlessly to AWS through the VPN, enabling daily file transfers without significant changes to application code or infrastructure.

Question 832
A company runs its application on Oracle Database Enterprise Edition. The company needs to migrate the application and the database to AWS. The company can use the Bring Your Own License (BYOL) model while migrating to AWS. The application uses third-party database features that require privileged access.
A solutions architect must design a solution for the database migration.
Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?
A.
Migrate the database to Amazon RDS for Oracle by using native tools. Replace the third-party features with AWS Lambda.
B.
Migrate the database to Amazon RDS Custom for Oracle by using native tools. Customize the new database settings to support the third-party features.
C.
Migrate the database to Amazon DynamoDB by using AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS). Customize the new database settings to support the third-party features.
D.
Migrate the database to Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL by using AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS). Rewrite the application code to remove the dependency on third-party features.

Answer: B

Explanation:
BYOL + third-party features/applications = RDS Custom. Hence customer is using Oracle so we should use RDS customer for Oracle

Question 834
A company has a production web application in which users upload documents through a web interface or a mobile app. According to a new regulatory requirement. new documents cannot be modified or deleted after they are stored.
What should a solutions architect do to meet this requirement?
A.
Store the uploaded documents in an Amazon S3 bucket with S3 Versioning and S3 Object Lock enabled.
B.
Store the uploaded documents in an Amazon S3 bucket. Configure an S3 Lifecycle policy to archive the documents periodically.
C.
Store the uploaded documents in an Amazon S3 bucket with S3 Versioning enabled. Configure an ACL to restrict all access to read-only.
D.
Store the uploaded documents on an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) volume. Access the data by mounting the volume in read-only mode.

Answer: A

Explanation:
S3 Versioning allows you to preserve every version of a document as it is uploaded or modified. This prevents accidental or intentional modifications or deletions of the documents.
S3 Object Loc allows you to set a retention period or legal hold on the objects, making them immutable during the specified period. This ensures that the stored documents cannot be modified or deleted, even by privileged users or administrators.
B. Configuring an S3 Lifecycle policy to archive documents periodically does not guarantee the prevention of document modification or deletion after they are stored.
C. Enabling S3 Versioning alone does not prevent modifications or deletions of objects. Configuring an ACL does not guarantee the prevention of modifications or deletions by authorized users.
D. Using EFS does not prevent modifications or deletions of the documents by users or processes with write permissions.

Question 835
A company wants to build a map of its IT infrastructure to identify and enforce policies on resources that pose security risks. The company's security team must be able to query data in the IT infrastructure map and quickly identify security risks.

Use Amazon RDS to store the data. Use SQL to query the data to identify security risks.
B.
Use Amazon Neptune to store the data. Use SPARQL to query the data to identify security risks.
C.
Use Amazon Redshift to store the data. Use SQL to query the data to identify security risks.
D.
Use Amazon DynamoDB to store the data. Use PartiQL to query the data to identify security risks.

Answer: B

Explanation:
Neptune is the only Graph database from all options which seems to be most suitable.
I'm not sure about SPARQL but hence Neptun is the best option hence SPARQL should be to.

Question 836
A large company wants to provide its globally located developers separate, limited size, managed PostgreSQL databases for development purposes. The databases will be low volume. The developers need the databases only when they are actively working.
Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?
A.
Give the developers the ability to launch separate Amazon Aurora instances. Set up a process to shut down Aurora instances at the end of the workday and to start Aurora instances at the beginning of the next workday.
B.
Develop an AWS Service Catalog product that enforces size restrictions for launching Amazon Aurora instances. Give the developers access to launch the product when they need a development database.
C.
Create an Amazon Aurora Serverless cluster. Develop an AWS Service Catalog product to launch databases in the cluster with the default capacity settings. Grant the developers access to the product.
D.
Monitor AWS Trusted Advisor checks for idle Amazon RDS databases. Create a process to terminate identified idle RDS databases.

Answer: B?C?

Explanation:
B
Requirement: Each developer needs a separate DB. In a cluster, DB is shared among developers.

C
(A,B,D) eliminated. Aurora instances & Amazon RDS use On-Demand or Reserved INSTANCES. These are more expensive than a serverless solution.
(C) is correct. Amazon Aurora Serverless automatically starts up, shuts down & scales capacity up or down based on your application's needs; you pay only for capacity consumed.

Question 837
A company is building a web application that serves a content management system. The content management system runs on Amazon EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB). The EC2 instances run in an Auto Scaling group across multiple Availability Zones. Users are constantly adding and updating files, blogs, and other website assets in the content management system.
A solutions architect must implement a solution in which all the EC2 instances share up-to-date website content with the least possible lag time.
Which solution meets these requirements?
A.
Update the EC2 user data in the Auto Scaling group lifecycle policy to copy the website assets from the EC2 instance that was launched most recently. Configure the ALB to make changes to the website assets only in the newest EC2 instance.
B.
Copy the website assets to an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file system. Configure each EC2 instance to mount the EFS file system locally. Configure the website hosting application to reference the website assets that are stored in the EFS file system.
C.
Copy the website assets to an Amazon S3 bucket. Ensure that each EC2 instance downloads the website assets from the S3 bucket to the attached Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume. Run the S3 sync command once each hour to keep files up to date.
D.
Restore an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) snapshot with the website assets. Attach the EBS snapshot as a secondary EBS volume when a new EC2 instance is launched. Configure the website hosting application to reference the website assets that are stored in the secondary EBS volume.

Answer: B

Explanation:

Question 838
A company's web application consists of multiple Amazon EC2 instances that run behind an Application Load Balancer in a VPC. An Amazon RDS for MySQL DB instance contains the data. The company needs the ability to automatically detect and respond to suspicious or unexpected behavior in its AWS environment. The company already has added AWS WAF to its architecture.
What should a solutions architect do next to protect against threats?
A.
Use Amazon GuardDuty to perform threat detection. Configure Amazon EventBridge to filter for GuardDuty findings and to invoke an AWS Lambda function to adjust the AWS WAF rules.
B.
Use AWS Firewall Manager to perform threat detection. Configure Amazon EventBridge to filter for Firewall Manager findings and to invoke an AWS Lambda function to adjust the AWS WAF web ACL.

Question 839
A company is planning to run a group of Amazon EC2 instances that connect to an Amazon Aurora database. The company has built an AWS CloudFormation template to deploy the EC2 instances and the Aurora DB cluster. The company wants to allow the instances to authenticate to the database in a secure way. The company does not want to maintain static database credentials.
Which solution meets these requirements with the LEAST operational effort?
A.
Create a database user with a user name and password. Add parameters for the database user name and password to the CloudFormation template. Pass the parameters to the EC2 instances when the instances are launched.
B.
Create a database user with a user name and password. Store the user name and password in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store. Configure the EC2 instances to retrieve the database credentials from Parameter Store.
C.
Configure the DB cluster to use IAM database authentication. Create a database user to use with IAM authentication. Associate a role with the EC2 instances to allow applications on the instances to access the database.
D.
Configure the DB cluster to use IAM database authentication with an IAM user. Create a database user that has a name that matches the IAM user. Associate the IAM user with the EC2 instances to allow applications on the instances to access the database.

Answer: C

Explanation:
Customer would like to not manage password rotation from my understanding, hence A and B are not the best solution here. I don't think we can associate IAM user with EC2 instance, but we can associate IAM role.
In summary C

Which solution will deploy the certificate without incurring any additional costs?
A.
Request an Amazon issued private certificate from AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) in the us-east-1 Region.
B.
Request an Amazon issued private certificate from AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) in the us-west-1 Region.
C.
Request an Amazon issued public certificate from AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) in the us-east-1 Region.
D.
Request an Amazon issued public certificate from AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) in the us-west-1 Region.

Answer: C

Explanation:
Per AWS "Public SSL/TLS certificates provisioned through AWS Certificate Manager are free. You pay only for the AWS resources you create to run your application."
https://aws.amazon.com/certificate-manager/pricing/?nc=sn&loc=3
But hence AWS is recommending to use US east 1 I think I would go with C
Note
We recommend that you use ACM to provision, manage, and deploy SSL/TLS certificates on AWS managed resources. You must request an ACM certificate in the US East (N. Virginia) Region.

Question 843
A company has primary and secondary data centers that are 500 miles (804.7 km) apart and interconnected with high-speed fiber-optic cable. The company needs a highly available and secure network connection between its data centers and a VPC on AWS for a mission-critical workload. A solutions architect must choose a connection solution that provides maximum resiliency.
Which solution meets these requirements?
A.
Two AWS Direct Connect connections from the primary data center terminating at two Direct Connect locations on two separate devices
B.
A single AWS Direct Connect connection from each of the primary and secondary data centers terminating at one Direct Connect location on the same device
C.
Two AWS Direct Connect connections from each of the primary and secondary data centers terminating at two Direct Connect locations on two separate devices
D.
A single AWS Direct Connect connection from each of the primary and secondary data centers terminating at one Direct Connect location on two separate devices

Answer: C

Explanation:
Redundant Connections: Having two Direct Connect connections from each data center provides redundancy in case one connection fails.
Diverse Direct Connect Locations: Terminating the connections at two different Direct Connect locations further eliminates the risk of a single point of failure due to issues at a specific location.
Separate Devices: Using separate devices at each Direct Connect location adds another layer of redundancy, preventing a single device failure from impacting connectivity.

Question 844
A company runs several Amazon RDS for Oracle On-Demand DB instances that have high utilization. The RDS DB instances run in member accounts that are in an organization in AWS Organizations.
The company's finance team has access to the organization's management account and member accounts. The finance team wants to find ways to optimize costs by using AWS Trusted Advisor.
Which combination of steps will meet these requirements? (Choose two.)
A.
Use the Trusted Advisor recommendations in the management account.
B.
Use the Trusted Advisor recommendations in the member accounts where the RDS DB instances are running.
C.
Review the Trusted Advisor checks for Amazon RDS Reserved Instance Optimization.
D.
Review the Trusted Advisor checks for Amazon RDS Idle DB Instances.
E.
Review the Trusted Advisor checks for compute optimization. Crosscheck the results by using AWS Compute Optimizer.

Answer: AC

Explanation:
We have On-Demand instances of RDS. If DB is used very often then it can occur that using Reserved Instrance can bring some $$ savings.
It is mentioned in AWS docs :)
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awssupport/latest/user/cost-optimization-checks.html#amazon-ec2-reserved-instances-optimization

Question 845
A company has several web servers that need to frequently access a common Amazon RDS MySQL Multi-AZ DB instance. The company wants a secure method for the web servers to connect to the database while meeting a security requirement to rotate user credentials frequently.
Which solution meets these requirements?
A.
Store the database user credentials in AWS Secrets Manager. Grant the necessary IAM permissions to allow the web servers to access AWS Secrets Manager.
B.
Store the database user credentials in AWS Systems Manager OpsCenter. Grant the necessary IAM permissions to allow the web servers to access OpsCenter.
C.
Store the database user credentials in a secure Amazon S3 bucket. Grant the necessary IAM permissions to allow the web servers to retrieve credentials and access the database.
D.
Store the database user credentials in files encrypted with AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) on the web server file system. The web server should be able to decrypt the files and access the database.

Answer: A

Explanation:
B. SSM OpsCenter is primarily used for managing and resolving operational issues. It is not designed to securely store and manage credentials like AWS Secrets Manager.
C. Storing credentials in an S3 bucket may provide some level of security, but it lacks the additional features and security controls offered by AWS Secrets Manager.
D. While using KMS for encryption is a good practice, managing credentials directly on the web server file system can introduce complexities and potential security risks. It can be challenging to securely manage and rotate credentials across multiple web servers, especially when considering scalability and automation.
In summary, option A is the recommended solution as it leverages AWS Secrets Manager, which is purpose-built for securely storing and managing secrets, and provides the necessary IAM permissions to allow the web servers to access the credentials securely.

Question 846
A solutions architect is creating an application. The application will run on Amazon EC2 instances in private subnets across multiple Availability Zones in a VPC. The EC2 instances will frequently access large files that contain confidential information. These files are stored in Amazon S3 buckets for processing. The solutions architect must optimize the network architecture to minimize data transfer costs.
What should the solutions architect do to meet these requirements?
A.
Create a gateway endpoint for Amazon S3 in the VPC. In the route tables for the private subnets, add an entry for the gateway endpoint.
B.
Create a single NAT gateway in a public subnet. In the route tables for the private subnets, add a default route that points to the NAT gateway.
C.
Create an AWS PrivateLink interface endpoint for Amazon S3 in the VPIn the route tables for the private subnets, add an entry for the interface endpoint.
D.
Create one NAT gateway for each Availability Zone in public subnets. In each of the route tables for the private subnets, add a default route that points to the NAT gateway in the same Availability Zone.

Answer: A

Explanation:
I think only option A have any sense. It is cheap (no cost), it is secure (traffic is not going to public network).
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/gateway-endpoints.html

Question 847
A company wants to relocate its on-premises MySQL database to AWS. The database accepts regular imports from a client-facing application, which causes a high volume of write operations. The company is concerned that the amount of traffic might be causing performance issues within the application.
How should a solutions architect design the architecture on AWS?
A.
Provision an Amazon RDS for MySQL DB instance with Provisioned IOPS SSD storage. Monitor write operation metrics by using Amazon CloudWatch. Adjust the provisioned IOPS if necessary.
B.
Provision an Amazon RDS for MySQL DB instance with General Purpose SSD storage. Place an Amazon ElastiCache cluster in front of the DB instance. Configure the application to query ElastiCache instead.
C.
Provision an Amazon DocumentDB (with MongoDB compatibility) instance with a memory optimized instance type. Monitor Amazon CloudWatch for performance-related issues. Change the instance class if necessary.
D.
Provision an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file system in General Purpose performance mode. Monitor Amazon CloudWatch for IOPS bottlenecks. Change to Provisioned Throughput performance mode if necessary.

Answer: A

Explanation:
For sure we cannot choose generar purpose IOPS SSD hence I would choos provisioned one. addtionally it is a good idea to monitor performance with CloudWatch and adjust setup(provisioned IOPS) if there will be a need.

Question 848
A company runs an application in the AWS Cloud that generates sensitive archival data files. The company wants to rearchitect the application's data storage. The company wants to encrypt the data files and to ensure that third parties do not have access to the data before the data is encrypted and sent to AWS. The company has already created an Amazon S3 bucket.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Configure the S3 bucket to use client-side encryption with an Amazon S3 managed encryption key. Configure the application to use the S3 bucket to store the archival files.
B.
Configure the S3 bucket to use server-side encryption with AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS). Configure the application to use the S3 bucket to store the archival files.
C.
Configure the S3 bucket to use dual-layer server-side encryption with AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS). Configure the application to use the S3 bucket to store the archival files.
D.
Configure the application to use client-side encryption with a key stored in AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS). Configure the application to store the archival files in the S3 bucket.

Answer: D

Explanation:
"Amazon S3 managed encryption key" (SSE-S3) is a server-side encryption. Therefore it is not a client-side encryption. To encrypt the data before sending to S3, it has to be client-side encryption.

Question 849
A company uses Amazon RDS with default backup settings for its database tier. The company needs to make a daily backup of the database to meet regulatory requirements. The company must retain the backups for 30 days.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?
A.
Write an AWS Lambda function to create an RDS snapshot every day.
B.
Modify the RDS database to have a retention period of 30 days for automated backups.
C.
Use AWS Systems Manager Maintenance Windows to modify the RDS backup retention period.
D.
Create a manual snapshot every day by using the AWS CLI. Modify the RDS backup retention period.

Answer: B

Explanation:
By default, Amazon RDS creates and saves automated backups of your DB instance securely in Amazon S3 for a user-specified retention period. You can set the backup retention period from 1 to 35 days. The maximum retention period currently available for automated snapshots is 35 days. When automated backups are turned on for your DB Instance, Amazon RDS automatically performs a full, daily snapshot of your data and captures transaction logs.

Question 850
A company that runs its application on AWS uses an Amazon Aurora DB cluster as its database. During peak usage hours when multiple users access and read the data, the monitoring system shows degradation of database performance for the write queries. The company wants to increase the scalability of the application to meet peak usage demands.
Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?
A.
Create a second Aurora DB cluster. Configure a copy job to replicate the users’ data to the new database. Update the application to use the second database to read the data.
B.
Create an Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) cluster in front of the existing Aurora DB cluster. Update the application to use the DAX cluster for read-only queries. Write data directly to the Aurora DB cluster.
C.
Create an Aurora read replica in the existing Aurora DB cluster. Update the application to use the replica endpoint for read-only queries and to use the cluster endpoint for write queries.
D.
Create an Amazon Redshift cluster. Copy the users' data to the Redshift cluster. Update the application to connect to the Redshift cluster and to perform read-only queries on the Redshift cluster.

Answer: C

Explanation:
A - We can create only RO replica of DB hence this is not possible.
D - Redshift is not for a DB from my understanding but more like analitics tools
B - Could be a thinkg but there is no point of Read-Only from DAX and write to DB cluster. beside it is hard to say if it would be cost effective as we are paying per hour not R/W requests as it is with replica.
Hence I would go with C

Question 851
A company's near-real-time streaming application is running on AWS. As the data is ingested, a job runs on the data and takes 30 minutes to complete.

Question 856
A company hosts an application on AWS Lambda functions that are invoked by an Amazon API Gateway API. The Lambda functions save customer data to an Amazon Aurora MySQL database. Whenever the company upgrades the database, the Lambda functions fail to establish database connections until the upgrade is complete. The result is that customer data is not recorded for some of the event.
A solutions architect needs to design a solution that stores customer data that is created during database upgrades.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Provision an Amazon RDS proxy to sit between the Lambda functions and the database. Configure the Lambda functions to connect to the RDS proxy.
B.
Increase the run time of the Lambda functions to the maximum. Create a retry mechanism in the code that stores the customer data in the database.
C.
Persist the customer data to Lambda local storage. Configure new Lambda functions to scan the local storage to save the customer data to the database.
D.
Store the customer data in an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) FIFO queue. Create a new Lambda function that polls the queue and stores the customer data in the database.

Answer: A?D?

Explanation:
A
https://aws.amazon.com/rds/proxy/
RDS Proxy minimizes application disruption from outages affecting the availability of your database by automatically connecting to a new database instance while preserving application connections. When failovers occur, RDS Proxy routes requests directly to the new database instance. This reduces failover times for Aurora and RDS databases by up to 66%.

D
A. It does not address the issue of storing customer data during database upgrades. The problem lies in the Lambda failing to establish connections during upgrades.
B. Increasing the Lambda run time and implementing a retry mechanism can help mitigate some failures, but it does not provide a reliable solution for storing customer data during database upgrades. The issue is not with the Lambda functions' execution time or retry logic, but with the database connection failures during upgrades.
C. Lambda local storage is temporary and is not designed for durable data storage. It is not a reliable solution for persisting customer data, especially during database upgrades.
In summary, option D is the recommended solution as it utilizes an SQS FIFO queue to store customer data. By decoupling the data storage from the database connection, the Lambda can store the data reliably in the queue even during database upgrades. A separate Lambda can then poll the queue and save the customer data to the database, ensuring no data loss during upgrade periods.

Question 857
A company has two AWS accounts: Production and Development. The company needs to push code changes in the Development account to the Production account. In the alpha phase, only two senior developers on the development team need access to the Production account. In the beta phase, more developers will need access to perform testing.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Create two policy documents by using the AWS Management Console in each account. Assign the policy to developers who need access.
B.
Create an IAM role in the Development account. Grant the IAM role access to the Production account. Allow developers to assume the role.
C.
Create an IAM role in the Production account. Define a trust policy that specifies the Development account. Allow developers to assume the role.
D.
Create an IAM group in the Production account. Add the group as a principal in a trust policy that specifies the Production account. Add developers to the group.

Answer: C?D?

Explanation:
C
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_cross-account-with-roles.html
groups can't be used in trust policy.

D
If you want ALL the developers to assume the role in the production, then C using a trust policy to assume the role in production is perfect BUT 
You could allow users in development account to assume the role in production, but in the end you will maintain potentially a big trust policy depending of the total number of users.
Here you want only some developers to connect to the production (others will follow without knowing if they all can connect and without knowing the number) so managing a separate group will give you a little more maintenance but will allow you to have different rights between the users.

Question 860
A company has migrated a fleet of hundreds of on-premises virtual machines (VMs) to Amazon EC2 instances. The instances run a diverse fleet of Windows Server versions along with several Linux distributions. The company wants a solution that will automate inventory and updates of the operating systems. The company also needs a summary of common vulnerabilities of each instance for regular monthly reviews.
What should a solutions architect recommend to meet these requirements?
A.
Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to manage all the EC2 instances. Configure AWS Security Hub to produce monthly reports.
B.
Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to manage all the EC2 instances. Deploy Amazon Inspector, and configure monthly reports.
C.
Set up AWS Shield Advanced, and configure monthly reports. Deploy AWS Config to automate patch installations on the EC2 instances.
D.
Set up Amazon GuardDuty in the account to monitor all EC2 instances. Deploy AWS Config to automate patch installations on the EC2 instances.

Answer: B

Explanation:
AWS Security Hub performs security best practice checks, aggregates alerts, and enables automated remediation.
Amazon Inspector scan workload for vulnerabilities
Guardduty threat detection for malicious activity in all account
AWS Shield DDOS 
Regarding security B and D can be right (maybe D a little too much). For patching B is the only valid option.

Question 861
A company hosts its application in the AWS Cloud. The application runs on Amazon EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group behind an Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) load balancer. The application connects to an Amazon DynamoDB table.
For disaster recovery (DR) purposes, the company wants to ensure that the application is available from another AWS Region with minimal downtime.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST downtime?
A.
Create an Auto Scaling group and an ELB in the DR Region. Configure the DynamoDB table as a global table. Configure DNS failover to point to the new DR Region's ELB.
B.
Create an AWS CloudFormation template to create EC2 instances, ELBs, and DynamoDB tables to be launched when necessary. Configure DNS failover to point to the new DR Region's ELB.
C.
Create an AWS CloudFormation template to create EC2 instances and an ELB to be launched when necessary. Configure the DynamoDB table as a global table. Configure DNS failover to point to the new DR Region's ELB.
D.
Create an Auto Scaling group and an ELB in the DR Region. Configure the DynamoDB table as a global table. Create an Amazon CloudWatch alarm with an evaluation period of 10 minutes to invoke an AWS Lambda function that updates Amazon Route 53 to point to the DR Region's ELB.

Answer: A

Explanation:
Hence there is no information that solution need to be cost effective and the main requirement is minimal downtime i would go with AUTOSCALING in DR region with 1 ELB and 1 server there but in case of need amount of servers can be increased automatically. Hence at least 1 server and ELB will be waiting and DynamoDB thanks to global table will be active in the same DR region as well, hence we need to inform users, using DNS about new destination, hence DNS failover to the ELB in DR region is the best solution here.

Question 862
A company runs an application on Amazon EC2 instances in a private subnet. The application needs to store and retrieve data in Amazon S3 buckets. According to regulatory requirements, the data must not travel across the public internet.
What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?
A.
Deploy a NAT gateway to access the S3 buckets.
B.
Deploy AWS Storage Gateway to access the S3 buckets.
C.
Deploy an S3 interface endpoint to access the S3 buckets.
D.
Deploy an S3 gateway endpoint to access the S3 buckets.

Answer: D

Explanation:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/privatelink-interface-endpoints.html
taking into consideration that in both cases (s3 Instance Endpoint and S3Gateway endpoint), network traffic remains on the AWS network we need to think about other data which we have. For example application is in AWS cloud hence there is no need for access from on-premises. in that situation S3 Gateway endpoint seems to be better (and it is for free)
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/privatelink-interface-endpoints.html#types-of-vpc-endpoints-for-s3

Question 863
A company hosts an application on Amazon EC2 instances that run in a single Availability Zone. The application is accessible by using the transport layer of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model. The company needs the application architecture to have high availability.
Which combination of steps will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively? (Choose two.)
A.
Configure new EC2 instances in a different Availability Zone. Use Amazon Route 53 to route traffic to all instances.
B.
Configure a Network Load Balancer in front of the EC2 instances.
C.
Configure a Network Load Balancer for TCP traffic to the instances. Configure an Application Load Balancer for HTTP and HTTPS traffic to the instances.
D.
Create an Auto Scaling group for the EC2 instances. Configure the Auto Scaling group to use multiple Availability Zones. Configure the Auto Scaling group to run application health checks on the instances.
E.
Create an Amazon CloudWatch alarm. Configure the alarm to restart EC2 instances that transition to a stopped state.

Answer: BD

Explanation:
There is no information about the ports numbers and only that means that we need to use NLB, ALB is only for HTTP hence there is no point of using that solution as connection can be done via any port for exampl 4000 
Autoscaling with instances in multiple AZ is the best solution. it will allow run new EC2 if it fail and in case if whole AZ will go down we will have 2nd one.

Question 864
A company uses Amazon S3 to host its static website. The company wants to add a contact form to the webpage. The contact form will have dynamic server-side components for users to input their name, email address, phone number, and user message.
The company expects fewer than 100 site visits each month. The contact form must notify the company by email when a customer fills out the form.
Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?
A.
Host the dynamic contact form in Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS). Set up Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES) to connect to a third-party email provider.
B.
Create an Amazon API Gateway endpoint that returns the contact form from an AWS Lambda function. Configure another Lambda function on the API Gateway to publish a message to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic.
C.
Host the website by using AWS Amplify Hosting for static content and dynamic content. Use server-side scripting to build the contact form. Configure Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) to deliver the message to the company.
D.
Migrate the website from Amazon S3 to Amazon EC2 instances that run Windows Server. Use Internet Information Services (IIS) for Windows Server to host the webpage. Use client-side scripting to build the contact form. Integrate the form with Amazon WorkMail.

Answer: B

Explanation:
API gateway + Lambda seems to be the best option expecially when SNS is in use which is specially created to push messaged to the subscribers (company appropraiate team in this situation)

Question 865
A company creates dedicated AWS accounts in AWS Organizations for its business units. Recently, an important notification was sent to the root user email address of a business unit account instead of the assigned account owner. The company wants to ensure that all future notifications can be sent to different employees based on the notification categories of billing, operations, or security.
Which solution will meet these requirements MOST securely?
A.
Configure each AWS account to use a single email address that the company manages. Ensure that all account owners can access the email account to receive notifications. Configure alternate contacts for each AWS account with corresponding distribution lists for the billing team, the security team, and the operations team for each business unit.
B.
Configure each AWS account to use a different email distribution list for each business unit that the company manages. Configure each distribution list with administrator email addresses that can respond to alerts. Configure alternate contacts for each AWS account with corresponding distribution lists for the billing team, the security team, and the operations team for each business unit.
C.
Configure each AWS account root user email address to be the individual company managed email address of one person from each business unit. Configure alternate contacts for each AWS account with corresponding distribution lists for the billing team, the security team, and the operations team for each business unit.
D.
Configure each AWS account root user to use email aliases that go to a centralized mailbox. Configure alternate contacts for each account by using a single business managed email distribution list each for the billing team, the security team, and the operations team.

Answer: D

Explanation:
Configuring each AWS account's root user to use email aliases that go to a centralized mailbox ensures that sensitive notifications are not directly sent to individual email addresses. Instead, they are directed to a centralized mailbox, reducing the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive information. Additionally, configuring alternate contacts for each account using a single business-managed email distribution list for the billing team, the security team, and the operations team ensures that notifications are appropriately routed to the respective teams based on the categories of billing, operations, or security. This approach centralizes control and reduces the likelihood of misconfiguration or unauthorized access to sensitive notifications.

Option A doesn't provide the same level of security because it relies on a single email address managed by the company, which could be compromised, and it requires all account owners to access this email account, potentially leading to access control issues.
Option B presents a similar issue as Option A, as it relies on different email distribution lists but still requires administrator email addresses that may be vulnerable to compromise.
Option C also has security concerns because it associates the root user email address with individual employees, which may not be ideal for security and access control purposes.
So, Option D is the most secure solution for ensuring that future notifications can be sent to different employees based on the notification categories of billing, operations, or security.

Question 866
A company runs an ecommerce application on AWS. Amazon EC2 instances process purchases and store the purchase details in an Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster.
Customers are experiencing application timeouts during times of peak usage. A solutions architect needs to rearchitect the application so that the application can scale to meet peak usage demands.
Which combination of actions will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively? (Choose two.)
A.
Configure an Auto Scaling group of new EC2 instances to retry the purchases until the processing is complete. Update the applications to connect to the DB cluster by using Amazon RDS Proxy.
B.
Configure the application to use an Amazon ElastiCache cluster in front of the Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster.
C.
Update the application to send the purchase requests to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Configure an Auto Scaling group of new EC2 instances that read from the SQS queue.
D.
Configure an AWS Lambda function to retry the ticket purchases until the processing is complete.
E.
Configure an Amazon AP! Gateway REST API with a usage plan.

Answer: AC

Explanation:
A) uses RDS Proxy which is mainly for connection pooling and availability issues. Proxy is for too many connections(, not for performance: read replicas, caching) 
B is caching which is designed for solving read-issues. (Here we have timeouts, and connection issues.)
C: SQS is good method for decoupling.

Question 867
A survey company has gathered data for several years from areas in the United States. The company hosts the data in an Amazon S3 bucket that is 3 TB in size and growing. The company has started to share the data with a European marketing firm that has S3 buckets. The company wants to ensure that its data transfer costs remain as low as possible.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Configure the Requester Pays feature on the company's S3 bucket.
B.
Configure S3 Cross-Region Replication from the company's S3 bucket to one of the marketing firm's S3 buckets.
C.
Configure cross-account access for the marketing firm so that the marketing firm has access to the company's S3 bucket.
D.
Configure the company's S3 bucket to use S3 Intelligent-Tiering. Sync the S3 bucket to one of the marketing firm's S3 buckets.

Answer: A?B?C?

Explanation:
A
"Typically, you configure buckets to be Requester Pays buckets when you want to share data but not incur charges associated with others accessing the data. For example, you might use Requester Pays buckets when making available large datasets, such as zip code directories, reference data, geospatial information, or web crawling data."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/RequesterPaysBuckets.html

B
B. Configure S3 Cross-Region Replication from the company's S3 bucket to one of the marketing firm's S3 buckets.
Configuring S3 Cross-Region Replication allows the company to replicate the data from their S3 bucket to one of the marketing firm's S3 buckets in a different region, which can help to reduce data transfer costs. With S3 Cross-Region Replication, data is automatically replicated across regions, which can help to ensure that the data is always available and up to date.

Option A, configuring the Requester Pays feature, would not directly address the goal of reducing data transfer costs. The Requester Pays feature allows the owner of an S3 bucket to specify that requests for objects in the bucket should be charged to the requester, rather than the owner of the bucket. This means that the marketing firm would be responsible for paying the data transfer fees when accessing the data in the company's S3 bucket.
Option C, configuring cross-account access, would allow the marketing firm to access the company's S3 bucket, but it would not directly address the goal of reducing data transfer costs. Cross-account access allows one AWS account to access resources in another AWS account, but it does not affect the cost of data transfer between accounts.

C
A. Enabling the Requester Pays feature would shift the data transfer costs to the European marketing firm, but it may not be the most cost-effective solution.
B. Enabling cross-region replication would copy the data from the company's S3 to the marketing firm's S3, but it would incur additional data transfer costs. This solution doesn't focus on minimizing data transfer costs for the company.
D. Using S3 Intelligent-Tiering and syncing the bucket to the marketing firm's S3 may help optimize storage costs by automatically moving objects to the most cost-effective storage class. However, it does not specifically address the goal of minimizing data transfer costs for the company.
In summary, option C is the recommended solution as it allows the marketing firm to access the company's S3 through cross-account access. This enables the marketing firm to retrieve the data directly from the company's bucket without incurring additional data transfer costs. It ensures that the survey company retains control over its data and can minimize its own data transfer expenses.

Question 868
A company that uses AWS Organizations runs 150 applications across 30 different AWS accounts. The company used AWS Cost and Usage Report to create a new report in the management account. The report is delivered to an Amazon S3 bucket that is replicated to a bucket in the data collection account.
The company’s senior leadership wants to view a custom dashboard that provides NAT gateway costs each day starting at the beginning of the current month.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Share an Amazon QuickSight dashboard that includes the requested table visual. Configure QuickSight to use AWS DataSync to query the new report.
B.
Share an Amazon QuickSight dashboard that includes the requested table visual. Configure QuickSight to use Amazon Athena to query the new report.
C.
Share an Amazon CloudWatch dashboard that includes the requested table visual. Configure CloudWatch to use AWS DataSync to query the new report.
D.
Share an Amazon CloudWatch dashboard that includes the requested table visual. Configure CloudWatch to use Amazon Athena to query the new report.

Answer: B

Explanation:
You definitely use Athena to request S3.
Both cloudwatch and quicksight can interact with S3.
Since we are taking about "The company’s senior leadership" I'd tend to use quicksight for a better format.

Question 869
A company is hosting a high-traffic static website on Amazon S3 with an Amazon CloudFront distribution that has a default TTL of 0 seconds. The company wants to implement caching to improve performance for the website. However, the company also wants to ensure that stale content is not served for more than a few minutes after a deployment.
Which combination of caching methods should a solutions architect implement to meet these requirements? (Choose two.)
A.
Set the CloudFront default TTL to 2 minutes.
B.
Set a default TTL of 2 minutes on the S3 bucket.
C.
Add a Cache-Control private directive to the objects in Amazon S3.
D.
Create an AWS Lambda@Edge function to add an Expires header to HTTP responses. Configure the function to run on viewer response.
E.
Add a Cache-Control max-age directive of 24 hours to the objects in Amazon S3. On deployment, create a CloudFront invalidation to clear any changed files from edge caches.

Answer: AC?AE?

Explanation:
AC
Per table on URL
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html#expiration-individual-objects
answer E is incorrect because if we will change cache-control max-age to 24h it will means that customer browser will cache web for 24h and customer want to be sure that it will be not longer then few min.
Expires header (answer D) from my understanding can be used only on full folder of web not as lambda function which will reply to customer reqeusts.
We are setting Default TTL for CloudFront (answer A) not on S3 (answer B) and it will say CloudFront to cache web for 2min.

Adding Cache-control private (answerC) will work per customer wish but only if we will add them to the objects which are changed very often or if we will set minimum TTL. 
In the 1 situation User Browser will not store files which we designate to be often changed and mentioned files will be downloaded every time from origin.
In the 2 situation, Cloud front will cache web files for min TTL time but customer browser will not store them.
Taking all that in to account I would go with AC

AE
By default, each file automatically expires after 24 hours, but you can change the default behavior in two ways:
1. To change the cache duration for all files that match the same path pattern, you can change the CloudFront settings for Minimum TTL, Maximum TTL, and Default TTL for a cache behavior. 
2. To change the cache duration for an individual file, you can configure your origin to add a Cache-Control header with the max-age or s-maxage directive, or an Expires header to the file.
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html#expiration-individual-objects

Question 870
A company runs its application by using Amazon EC2 instances and AWS Lambda functions. The EC2 instances run in private subnets of a VPC. The Lambda functions need direct network access to the EC2 instances for the application to work.
The application will run for 1 year. The number of Lambda functions that the application uses will increase during the 1-year period. The company must minimize costs on all application resources.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Purchase an EC2 Instance Savings Plan. Connect the Lambda functions to the private subnets that contain the EC2 instances.
B.
Purchase an EC2 Instance Savings Plan. Connect the Lambda functions to new public subnets in the same VPC where the EC2 instances run.
C.
Purchase a Compute Savings Plan. Connect the Lambda functions to the private subnets that contain the EC2 instances.
D.
Purchase a Compute Savings Plan. Keep the Lambda functions in the Lambda service VPC.

Answer: C

Explanation:
Compute Savings Plan: This plan offers significant discounts on Lambda functions compared to on-demand pricing. Since the application will run for a year, a sustained use discount like Compute Savings Plan is ideal.
Private Subnets: Lambda functions in private subnets can directly access EC2 instances within the VPC without needing internet access, reducing security risks and potential egress costs.

Question 871
A company has deployed a multi-account strategy on AWS by using AWS Control Tower. The company has provided individual AWS accounts to each of its developers. The company wants to implement controls to limit AWS resource costs that the developers incur.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?
A.
Instruct each developer to tag all their resources with a tag that has a key of CostCenter and a value of the developer's name. Use the required-tags AWS Config managed rule to check for the tag. Create an AWS Lambda function to terminate resources that do not have the tag. Configure AWS Cost Explorer to send a daily report to each developer to monitor their spending.
B.
Use AWS Budgets to establish budgets for each developer account. Set up budget alerts for actual and forecast values to notify developers when they exceed or expect to exceed their assigned budget. Use AWS Budgets actions to apply a DenyAll policy to the developer's IAM role to prevent additional resources from being launched when the assigned budget is reached.
C.
Use AWS Cost Explorer to monitor and report on costs for each developer account. Configure Cost Explorer to send a daily report to each developer to monitor their spending. Use AWS Cost Anomaly Detection to detect anomalous spending and provide alerts.
D.
Use AWS Service Catalog to allow developers to launch resources within a limited cost range. Create AWS Lambda functions in each AWS account to stop running resources at the end of each work day. Configure the Lambda functions to resume the resources at the start of each work day.

Answer: B

Explanation:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cost-management/latest/userguide/budgets-controls.html
Taking into consideration that AWS Budgets is allowing to will inform you that you exceeded budged and execute actions like for example IAM actions to prevent running new resources in cloud, I think this option is a good and resonable move. In case of need budged can be always increased and "chains" disabled.

Question 872
A solutions architect is designing a three-tier web application. The architecture consists of an internet-facing Application Load Balancer (ALB) and a web tier that is hosted on Amazon EC2 instances in private subnets. The application tier with the business logic runs on EC2 instances in private subnets. The database tier consists of Microsoft SQL Server that runs on EC2 instances in private subnets. Security is a high priority for the company.
Which combination of security group configurations should the solutions architect use? (Choose three.)
A.
Configure the security group for the web tier to allow inbound HTTPS traffic from the security group for the ALB.
B.
Configure the security group for the web tier to allow outbound HTTPS traffic to 0.0.0.0/0.
C.
Configure the security group for the database tier to allow inbound Microsoft SQL Server traffic from the security group for the application tier.
D.
Configure the security group for the database tier to allow outbound HTTPS traffic and Microsoft SQL Server traffic to the security group for the web tier.
E.
Configure the security group for the application tier to allow inbound HTTPS traffic from the security group for the web tier.
F.
Configure the security group for the application tier to allow outbound HTTPS traffic and Microsoft SQL Server traffic to the security group for the web tier.

Answer: ACE

Explanation:
Security Group is protecting instances, it's statefull. by defoult is allowing for outgoing traffic but not incomming.
hence we need to allow for inboud traffic. path looks like below
ALB >>HTTPS>> WEB tier >>HTTPS>> Application >>SQL traffic>> SQL DB
hence we need allow for 
incoming https traffic on web tier 
then 
incomming http on app tier 
and on the end for
incomming sql traffic on DB tier

Question 873
A company has released a new version of its production application. The company's workload uses Amazon EC2, AWS Lambda, AWS Fargate, and Amazon SageMaker.
The company wants to cost optimize the workload now that usage is at a steady state. The company wants to cover the most services with the fewest savings plans.
Which combination of savings plans will meet these requirements? (Choose two.)
A.
Purchase an EC2 Instance Savings Plan for Amazon EC2 and SageMaker.
B.
Purchase a Compute Savings Plan for Amazon EC2, Lambda, and SageMaker.
C.
Purchase a SageMaker Savings Plan.
D.
Purchase a Compute Savings Plan for Lambda, Fargate, and Amazon EC2.
E.
Purchase an EC2 Instance Savings Plan for Amazon EC2 and Fargate.

Answer: CD

B.
Enable Babelfish on Aurora PostgreSQL to run the SQL queries from the applications.
C.
Migrate the database schema and data by using the AWS Schema Conversion Tool (AWS SCT) and AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS).
D.
Use Amazon RDS Proxy to connect the applications to Aurora PostgreSQL.
E.
Use AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) to rewrite the SQL queries in the applications.

Answer: BC

Explanation:
DMS will allow for DATABASE migration and use AWS Schema Conversion Tool (AWS SCT) to create some or all of the target tables, indexes, views, triggers, and so on.
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/Welcome.html
To minimalize amount of code which need to me changes we need to use babelfish

Question 875
A company plans to rehost an application to Amazon EC2 instances that use Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) as the attached storage.
A solutions architect must design a solution to ensure that all newly created Amazon EBS volumes are encrypted by default. The solution must also prevent the creation of unencrypted EBS volumes.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Configure the EC2 account attributes to always encrypt new EBS volumes.
B.
Use AWS Config. Configure the encrypted-volumes identifier. Apply the default AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key.
C.
Configure AWS Systems Manager to create encrypted copies of the EBS volumes. Reconfigure the EC2 instances to use the encrypted volumes.
D.
Create a customer managed key in AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS). Configure AWS Migration Hub to use the key when the company migrates workloads.

Answer: A

Explanation:
The task is to force automatic encryption for every new EBS volume and prevent possibility of creation any unencrypted volume hence:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/work-with-ebs-encr.html#ebs-encryption_key_mgmt
To enable encryption by default for a Region
Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.
From the navigation bar, select the Region.
From the navigation pane, select EC2 Dashboard.
In the upper-right corner of the page, choose Account Attributes, Data protection and security.
Choose Manage.
Select Enable. You keep the AWS managed key with the alias alias/aws/ebs created on your behalf as the default encryption key, or choose a symmetric customer managed encryption key.
Choose Update EBS encryption.

Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Use a data stream in Amazon Kinesis Data Streams in on-demand mode to capture the clickstream data. Use AWS Lambda to process the data in real time.
B.
Use Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose to capture the clickstream data. Use AWS Glue to process the data in real time.
C.
Use Amazon Kinesis Video Streams to capture the clickstream data. Use AWS Glue to process the data in real time.
D.
Use Amazon Managed Service for Apache Flink (previously known as Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics) to capture the clickstream data. Use AWS Lambda to process the data in real time.

Answer: A

Explanation:
Apache Flink (previously known as Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics) seems to not allowing sent data directly to Lambda...
Glue is allowing to integrate data from couple of sources in to one.
Hence I think A is correct answer

Question 877
A global company runs its workloads on AWS. The company's application uses Amazon S3 buckets across AWS Regions for sensitive data storage and analysis. The company stores millions of objects in multiple S3 buckets daily. The company wants to identify all S3 buckets that are not versioning-enabled.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Set up an AWS CloudTrail event that has a rule to identify all S3 buckets that are not versioning-enabled across Regions.
B.
Use Amazon S3 Storage Lens to identify all S3 buckets that are not versioning-enabled across Regions.
C.
Enable IAM Access Analyzer for S3 to identify all S3 buckets that are not versioning-enabled across Regions.
D.
Create an S3 Multi-Region Access Point to identify all S3 buckets that are not versioning-enabled across Regions.

Answer: B

Explanation:
S3 Sorage Lens "can also identify buckets that aren't following data-protection best practices, such as using S3 Replication or S3 Versioning. "
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/storage_lens_basics_metrics_recommendations.html

Question 878
A company uses Amazon S3 to store its confidential audit documents. The S3 bucket uses bucket policies to restrict access to audit team IAM user credentials according to the principle of least privilege. Company managers are worried about accidental deletion of documents in the S3 bucket and want a more secure solution.
What should a solutions architect do to secure the audit documents?
A.
Enable the versioning and MFA Delete features on the S3 bucket.
B.
Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) on the IAM user credentials for each audit team IAM user account.
C.
Add an S3 Lifecycle policy to the audit team's IAM user accounts to deny the s3:DeleteObject action during audit dates.
D.
Use AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) to encrypt the S3 bucket and restrict audit team IAM user accounts from accessing the KMS key.

Answer: A

Explanation:
B. Enabling MFA on the IAM user credentials adds an extra layer of security to the user authentication process. However, it does not specifically address the concern of accidental deletion of documents in the S3 bucket.
C. Adding an S3 Lifecycle policy to deny the delete action during audit dates would prevent intentional deletions during specific time periods. However, it does not address accidental deletions that can occur at any time.
D. Using KMS for encryption and restricting access to the KMS key provides additional security for the data stored in the S3 . However, it does not directly prevent accidental deletion of documents in the S3.
Enabling versioning and MFA Delete on the S3 (option A) is the most appropriate solution for securing the audit documents. Versioning ensures that multiple versions of the documents are stored, allowing for easy recovery in case of accidental deletions. Enabling MFA Delete requires the use of multi-factor authentication to authorize deletion actions, adding an extra layer of protection against unintended deletions.

Question 879
A company needs to optimize its Amazon S3 storage costs for an application that generates many files that cannot be recreated. Each file is approximately 5 MB and is stored in Amazon S3 Standard storage.
The company must store the files for 4 years before the files can be deleted. The files must be immediately accessible. The files are frequently accessed in the first 30 days of object creation, but they are rarely accessed after the first 30 days.
Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?
A.
Create an S3 Lifecycle policy to move the files to S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval 30 days after object creation. Delete the files 4 years after object creation.
B.
Create an S3 Lifecycle policy to move the files to S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA) 30 days after object creation. Delete the files 4 years after object creation.
C.
Create an S3 Lifecycle policy to move the files to S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) 30 days after object creation. Delete the files 4 years after object creation.
D.
Create an S3 Lifecycle policy to move the files to S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) 30 days after object creation. Move the files to S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval 4 years after object creation.

Answer: A

Explanation:
Although it's not stated what is meant by 'rarely accessed', this scenario would primarily be a candidate for the Glacier Instant Retrieval tier as the storage price would be more than 3 times lower compared to Standard IA. In the specific case of files being more frequently retrieved than quarterly, it can qualify for consideration of Standard IA. 
Actually, we don't have the required info, so we have to guess what they are thinking.. which is pretty lame, to be honest..

Question 880
A company runs its critical storage application in the AWS Cloud. The application uses Amazon S3 in two AWS Regions. The company wants the application to send remote user data to the nearest S3 bucket with no public network congestion. The company also wants the application to fail over with the least amount of management of Amazon S3.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Implement an active-active design between the two Regions. Configure the application to use the regional S3 endpoints closest to the user.
B.
Use an active-passive configuration with S3 Multi-Region Access Points. Create a global endpoint for each of the Regions.
C.
Send user data to the regional S3 endpoints closest to the user. Configure an S3 cross-account replication rule to keep the S3 buckets synchronized.
D.
Set up Amazon S3 to use Multi-Region Access Points in an active-active configuration with a single global endpoint. Configure S3 Cross-Region Replication.

Answer: D

Explanation:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/MultiRegionAccessPoints.html
When you create a Multi-Region Access Point, you specify a set of AWS Regions where you want to store data to be served through that Multi-Region Access Point. You can use S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR) to synchronize data among buckets in those Regions. You can then request or write data through the Multi-Region Access Point global endpoint. Amazon S3 automatically serves requests to the replicated dataset from the closest available Region. Multi-Region Access Points are also compatible with applications that are running in Amazon virtual private clouds (VPCs), including those that are using AWS PrivateLink for Amazon S3.
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/replication.html

Question 881
A company is migrating a data center from its on-premises location to AWS. The company has several legacy applications that are hosted on individual virtual servers. Changes to the application designs cannot be made.
Each individual virtual server currently runs as its own EC2 instance. A solutions architect needs to ensure that the applications are reliable and fault tolerant after migration to AWS. The applications will run on Amazon EC2 instances.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Create an Auto Scaling group that has a minimum of one and a maximum of one. Create an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) of each application instance. Use the AMI to create EC2 instances in the Auto Scaling group Configure an Application Load Balancer in front of the Auto Scaling group.
B.
Use AWS Backup to create an hourly backup of the EC2 instance that hosts each application. Store the backup in Amazon S3 in a separate Availability Zone. Configure a disaster recovery process to restore the EC2 instance for each application from its most recent backup.
C.
Create an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) of each application instance. Launch two new EC2 instances from the AMI. Place each EC2 instance in a separate Availability Zone. Configure a Network Load Balancer that has the EC2 instances as targets.
D.
Use AWS Mitigation Hub Refactor Spaces to migrate each application off the EC2 instance. Break down functionality from each application into individual components. Host each application on Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) with an AWS Fargate launch type.

Answer: A?C?

Explanation:
A
Minimum and Maximum of one instance: Ensures that the instance is always running. If the instance fails, Auto Scaling will automatically replace it with a new one, maintaining high availability.
Amazon Machine Image (AMI): Captures the current state of the application instance, ensuring that new instances launched by Auto Scaling will have the same configuration.
Application Load Balancer (ALB):
Load Balancer: Distributes traffic to the instances in the Auto Scaling group, ensuring fault tolerance. Even though there is only one instance, the ALB can help manage incoming traffic and be ready for future scaling if needed.
For C:
While this provides high availability, it does not address fault tolerance as effectively as the Auto Scaling group approach. Without Auto Scaling, if an instance fails, manual intervention is required to launch new instances.


C
#1 AMI creation: Creating an AMI of each application instance allows for easy replication.
#2 Multiple Availability Zones: Launching instances in different Availability Zones provides redundancy in case of regional outages.
#3 Network Load Balancer: A Network Load Balancer distributes traffic across the instances, providing high availability by automatically routing requests to a healthy instance if one fails.

Convert the Aurora cluster to an Aurora global database. Configure managed failover.
C.
Create a new Aurora cluster in us-west-1 that has Cross-Region Replication.
D.
Create a new Aurora cluster in us-west-1. Use AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) to sync both clusters.

Answer: B

Explanation:
https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/global-database/
Cross-Region disaster recovery
If your primary Region suffers a performance degradation or outage, you can promote one of the secondary Regions to take read/write responsibilities. An Aurora cluster can recover in less than 1 minute, even in the event of a complete Regional outage. This provides your application with an effective recovery point objective (RPO) of 1 second and a recovery time objective (RTO) of less than 1 minute, providing a strong foundation for a global business continuity plan.

Question 888
A company is migrating five on-premises applications to VPCs in the AWS Cloud. Each application is currently deployed in isolated virtual networks on premises and should be deployed similarly in the AWS Cloud. The applications need to reach a shared services VPC. All the applications must be able to communicate with each other.
If the migration is successful, the company will repeat the migration process for more than 100 applications.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST administrative overhead?
A.
Deploy software VPN tunnels between the application VPCs and the shared services VPC. Add routes between the application VPCs in their subnets to the shared services VPC.
B.
Deploy VPC peering connections between the application VPCs and the shared services VPC. Add routes between the application VPCs in their subnets to the shared services VPC through the peering connection.
C.
Deploy an AWS Direct Connect connection between the application VPCs and the shared services VPAdd routes from the application VPCs in their subnets to the shared services VPC and the applications VPCs. Add routes from the shared services VPC subnets to the applications VPCs.
D.
Deploy a transit gateway with associations between the transit gateway and the application VPCs and the shared services VPC. Add routes between the application VPCs in their subnets and the application VPCs to the shared services VPC through the transit gateway.

Answer: D

Explanation:
AWS Transit Gateway:
Centralized Connectivity: AWS Transit Gateway provides a hub-and-spoke model for connecting multiple VPCs, simplifying network management by providing a single point of connectivity for all VPCs.
Scalability: It is designed to handle many VPCs, making it suitable for scaling beyond the initial five applications to more than 100 applications.
Reduced Administrative Overhead: Managing VPC peering connections or VPN tunnels for each pair of VPCs would become complex and difficult to manage at scale. Transit Gateway simplifies this by providing centralized routing and connectivity.

Question 889
A company is running an SMB file server in its data center. The file server stores large files that are accessed frequently for the first few days after the files are created. After 7 days the files are rarely accessed.
The total data size is increasing and is close to the company's total storage capacity. A solutions architect must increase the company's available storage space without losing low-latency access to the most recently accessed files. The solutions architect must also provide file lifecycle management to avoid future storage issues.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Use AWS DataSync to copy data that is older than 7 days from the SMB file server to AWS.
B.
Create an Amazon S3 File Gateway to extend the company's storage space. Create an S3 Lifecycle policy to transition the data to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 7 days.
C.
Create an Amazon FSx for Windows File Server file system to extend the company's storage space.
D.
Install a utility on each user's computer to access Amazon S3. Create an S3 Lifecycle policy to transition the data to S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval after 7 days.

Answer: B

Explanation:
Option B: Creating an Amazon S3 File Gateway is the recommended solution. It allows the company to extend their storage space by utilizing Amazon S3 as a scalable and durable storage service. The File Gateway provides low-latency access to the most recently accessed files by maintaining a local cache on-premises. The S3 Lifecycle policy can be configured to transition data to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 7 days, which provides long-term archival storage at a lower cost. This approach addresses both the storage capacity issue and the need for file lifecycle management.

Question 890
A company is using a SQL database to store movie data that is publicly accessible. The database runs on an Amazon RDS Single-AZ DB instance. A script runs queries at random intervals each day to record the number of new movies that have been added to the database. The script must report a final total during business hours.
The company's development team notices that the database performance is inadequate for development tasks when the script is running. A solutions architect must recommend a solution to resolve this issue.
Which solution will meet this requirement with the LEAST operational overhead?
A.
Modify the DB instance to be a Multi-AZ deployment.
B.
Create a read replica of the database. Configure the script to query only the read replica.
C.
Instruct the development team to manually export the entries in the database at the end of each day.
D.
Use Amazon ElastiCache to cache the common queries that the script runs against the database.

Answer: B

Explanation:
A. Modifying the DB to be a Multi-AZ deployment improves high availability and fault tolerance but does not directly address the performance issue during the script execution.
C. Instructing the development team to manually export the entries in the database introduces manual effort and is not a scalable or efficient solution.
D. While using ElastiCache for caching can improve read performance for common queries, it may not be the most suitable solution for the scenario described. Caching is effective for reducing the load on the database for frequently accessed data, but it may not directly address the performance issue during the script execution.
Creating a read replica of the database (option B) provides a scalable solution that offloads read traffic from the primary database. The script can be configured to query the read replica, reducing the impact on the primary database during the script execution.

Question 891
A company wants to use Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) to run its on-premises application in a hybrid environment. The application currently runs on containers on premises.
The company needs a single container solution that can scale in an on-premises, hybrid, or cloud environment. The company must run new application containers in the AWS Cloud and must use a load balancer for HTTP traffic.
Which combination of actions will meet these requirements? (Choose two.)
A.
Set up an ECS cluster that uses the AWS Fargate launch type for the cloud application containers. Use an Amazon ECS Anywhere external launch type for the on-premises application containers.
B.
Set up an Application Load Balancer for cloud ECS services.
C.
Set up a Network Load Balancer for cloud ECS services.
D.
Set up an ECS cluster that uses the AWS Fargate launch type. Use Fargate for the cloud application containers and the on-premises application containers.
E.
Set up an ECS cluster that uses the Amazon EC2 launch type for the cloud application containers. Use Amazon ECS Anywhere with an AWS Fargate launch type for the on-premises application containers.

Answer: AB

Explanation:
We need to load-balance HTTP traffic hence Application Load Balancer is needed. Because Customer want to use container solution we need to use ECS with Fargate which will lunch cloud applications. To run on-premises applications in containers we need to use ECS Anyware.
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/AWS_Fargate.html
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/Welcome.html

Amazon ECS services on AWS Fargate support the Application Load Balancer and Network Load Balancer load balancer types. Application Load Balancers are used to route HTTP/HTTPS (or layer 7) traffic.
Serverless (AWS Fargate (Fargate)) in the AWS cloud
Fargate is a serverless, pay-as-you-go compute engine. With Fargate you don't need to manage servers, handle capacity planning, or isolate container workloads for security.
On-premises virtual machines (VM) or servers
Amazon ECS Anywhere provides support for registering an external instance such as an on-premises server or virtual machine (VM), to your Amazon ECS cluster.

Question 894
A company manages a data lake in an Amazon S3 bucket that numerous applications access. The S3 bucket contains a unique prefix for each application. The company wants to restrict each application to its specific prefix and to have granular control of the objects under each prefix.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?
A.
Create dedicated S3 access points and access point policies for each application.
B.
Create an S3 Batch Operations job to set the ACL permissions for each object in the S3 bucket.
C.
Replicate the objects in the S3 bucket to new S3 buckets for each application. Create replication rules by prefix.
D.
Replicate the objects in the S3 bucket to new S3 buckets for each application. Create dedicated S3 access points for each application.

Answer: A

Explanation:
By creating separate access points for each application, you can enforce access controls specific to their respective prefixes while minimizing administrative complexity. This approach provides a clean separation of permissions and reduces the risk of misconfigurations.
Options B, C, and D are not as efficient or straightforward:
Option B (S3 Batch Operations) involves setting ACL permissions for each object individually, which can be cumbersome and time-consuming.
Option C (replicating objects to new S3 buckets) introduces additional buckets and replication rules, increasing management overhead.
Option D (replicating objects and creating dedicated S3 access points) adds unnecessary complexity by combining replication and access point creation.

Question 895
A company has an application that customers use to upload images to an Amazon S3 bucket. Each night, the company launches an Amazon EC2 Spot Fleet that processes all the images that the company received that day. The processing for each image takes 2 minutes and requires 512 MB of memory.
A solutions architect needs to change the application to process the images when the images are uploaded.
Which change will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?
A.
Use S3 Event Notifications to write a message with image details to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Configure an AWS Lambda function to read the messages from the queue and to process the images.
B.
Use S3 Event Notifications to write a message with image details to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Configure an EC2 Reserved Instance to read the messages from the queue and to process the images.
C.
Use S3 Event Notifications to publish a message with image details to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic. Configure a container instance in Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) to subscribe to the topic and to process the images.
D.
Use S3 Event Notifications to publish a message with image details to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic. Configure an AWS Elastic Beanstalk application to subscribe to the topic and to process the images.

Answer: A

Explanation:
when using SQS we will be sure that all images will be processed and hence to process we need 2 min and 512 MB of memory (Lambda is allowing upto 15 min and upto10K MB) Lambda should be perfect scalable solution which will allow for almost in real time image processing.

B.
Create an Amazon API Gateway REST API that has the S3 bucket as the target. Configure the CloudFormation stack to use the API Gateway URL.
C.
Create a presigned URL for the template object. Configure the CloudFormation stack to use the presigned URL.
D.
Allow public access to the template object in the S3 bucket. Block the public access after the test environment is created.

Answer: C

Explanation:
A presigned URL grants temporary access to an S3 object without making it publicly accessible.

Question 899
A company has applications that run in an organization in AWS Organizations. The company outsources operational support of the applications. The company needs to provide access for the external support engineers without compromising security.
The external support engineers need access to the AWS Management Console. The external support engineers also need operating system access to the company’s fleet ofAmazon EC2 instances that run Amazon Linux in private subnets.
Which solution will meet these requirements MOST securely?
A.
Confirm that AWS Systems Manager Agent (SSM Agent) is installed on all instances. Assign an instance profile with the necessary policy to connect to Systems Manager. Use AWS IAM Identity Center to provide the external support engineers console access. Use Systems Manager Session Manager to assign the required permissions.
B.
Confirm that AWS Systems Manager Agent (SSM Agent) is installed on all instances. Assign an instance profile with the necessary policy to connect to Systems Manager. Use Systems Manager Session Manager to provide local IAM user credentials in each AWS account to the external support engineers for console access.
C.
Confirm that all instances have a security group that allows SSH access only from the external support engineers’ source IP address ranges. Provide local IAM user credentials in each AWS account to the external support engineers for console access. Provide each external support engineer an SSH key pair to log in to the application instances.
D.
Create a bastion host in a public subnet. Set up the bastion host security group to allow access from only the external engineers’ IP address ranges. Ensure that all instances have a security group that allows SSH access from the bastion host. Provide each external support engineer an SSH key pair to log in to the application instances. Provide local account IAM user credentials to the engineers for console access.

Answer: A

Explanation:
Systems Manager Session Manager allows secure, auditable, and controlled access to your EC2 instances without needing to open SSH ports or manage SSH keys, reducing the attack surface. 
Local IAM user credentials are less secure and harder to manage at scale compared to using IAM Identity Center.

Question 900
A company uses Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL to run its applications in the us-east-1 Region. The company also uses machine learning (ML) models to forecast annual revenue based on near real-time reports. The reports are generated by using the same RDS for PostgreSQL database. The database performance slows during business hours. The company needs to improve database performance.
Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?
A.
Create a cross-Region read replica. Configure the reports to be generated from the read replica.
B.
Activate Multi-AZ DB instance deployment for RDS for PostgreSQL. Configure the reports to be generated from the standby database.
C.
Use AWS Data Migration Service (AWS DMS) to logically replicate data to a new database. Configure the reports to be generated from the new database.
D.
Create a read replica in us-east-1. Configure the reports to be generated from the read replica.

Answer: D

Explanation:
Read replicas are typically less expensive than setting up a cross-Region replica or activating Multi-AZ deployments. You only pay for the additional read replica, without the overhead costs associated with cross-Region data transfer or maintaining a synchronous standby in Multi-AZ setups.

Question 901
A company has applications that run on Amazon EC2 instances in a VPC. One of the applications needs to call the Amazon S3 API to store and read objects. According to the company's security regulations, no traffic from the applications is allowed to travel across the internet.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Configure an S3 gateway endpoint.
B.
Create an S3 bucket in a private subnet.
C.
Create an S3 bucket in the same AWS Region as the EC2 instances.
D.
Configure a NAT gateway in the same subnet as the EC2 instances.

Answer: A

Explanation:
B. Creating an S3 in a private subnet restricts direct internet access to the bucket but does not provide a direct and secure connection between the EC2and the S3. The application would still need to traverse the internet to access the S3 API.
C. Creating an S3 in the same Region as the EC2 does not inherently prevent traffic from traversing the internet.
D. Configuring a NAT gateway allows outbound internet connectivity for resources in private subnets, but it does not provide a direct and secure connection to the S3 service. The traffic from the EC2 to the S3 API would still traverse the internet.
The most suitable solution is to configure an S3 gateway endpoint (option A). It provides a secure and private connection between the VPC and the S3 service without requiring the traffic to traverse the internet. With an S3 gateway endpoint, the EC2 can access the S3 API directly within the VPC, meeting the security requirement of preventing traffic from traveling across the internet.

Question 902

Question 910
A company is using AWS DataSync to migrate millions of files from an on-premises system to AWS. The files are 10 KB in size on average.
The company wants to use Amazon S3 for file storage. For the first year after the migration, the files will be accessed once or twice and must be immediately available. After 1 year, the files must be archived for at least 7 years.
Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?
A.
Use an archive tool to group the files into large objects. Use DataSync to migrate the objects. Store the objects in S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval for the first year. Use a lifecycle configuration to transition the files to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 1 year with a retention period of 7 years.
B.
Use an archive tool to group the files into large objects. Use DataSync to copy the objects to S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA). Use a lifecycle configuration to transition the files to S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval after 1 year with a retention period of 7 years.
C.
Configure the destination storage class for the files as S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval. Use a lifecycle policy to transition the files to S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval after 1 year with a retention period of 7 years.
D.
Configure a DataSync task to transfer the files to S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA). Use a lifecycle configuration to transition the files to S3 Deep Archive after 1 year with a retention period of 7 years.

Answer: A?D?

Explanation:
A
took some research but A is correct Per Amazon S# glacier page: "Amazon S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval is an archive storage class that delivers the lowest-cost storage for long-lived data that is rarely accessed and requires retrieval in milliseconds. With S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval, you can save up to 68% on storage costs compared to using the S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) storage class, when your data is accessed once per quarter." After the one year move it to Deep archive.

D
D simplifies the process by directly using S3 Standard-IA and then transitioning to S3 Glacier Deep Archive, which aligns well with access patterns and cost requirements. Option A sounds right but using an archive tool to group files into large objects adds complexity and operational overhead. This step isn’t necessary if you can directly manage the files with S3 lifecycle policies.

Question 911
A company recently performed a lift and shift migration of its on-premises Oracle database workload to run on an Amazon EC2 memory optimized Linux instance. The EC2 Linux instance uses a 1 TB Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1) EBS volume with 64,000 IOPS.
The database storage performance after the migration is slower than the performance of the on-premises database.
Which solution will improve storage performance?
A.
Add more Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1) EBS volumes. Use OS commands to create a Logical Volume Management (LVM) stripe.
B.
Increase the Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1) EBS volume to more than 64,000 IOPS.
C.
Increase the size of the Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1) EBS volume to 2 TB.
D.
Change the EC2 Linux instance to a storage optimized instance type. Do not change the Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1) EBS volume.

Answer: A

Explanation:
The maximum provisioned IOPS for io1 is 64000 and hence you can achieve higher aggregate performance by adding more io1 volumes

Question 912
A company is storing sensitive user information in an Amazon S3 bucket. The company wants to provide secure access to this bucket from the application tier running on Amazon EC2 instances inside a VPC.
Which combination of steps should a solutions architect take to accomplish this? (Choose two.)
A.
Configure a VPC gateway endpoint for Amazon S3 within the VPC.
B.
Create a bucket policy to make the objects in the S3 bucket public.
C.
Create a bucket policy that limits access to only the application tier running in the VPC.
D.
Create an IAM user with an S3 access policy and copy the IAM credentials to the EC2 instance.
E.
Create a NAT instance and have the EC2 instances use the NAT instance to access the S3 bucket.

Answer: AC

Explanation:
A. This eliminates the need for the traffic to go over the internet, providing an added layer of security.
B. It is important to restrict access to the bucket and its objects only to authorized entities.
C. This helps maintain the confidentiality of the sensitive user information by limiting access to authorized resources.
D. In this case, since the EC2 instances are accessing the S3 bucket from within the VPC, using IAM user credentials is unnecessary and can introduce additional security risks.
E. a NAT instance to access the S3 bucket adds unnecessary complexity and overhead.
In summary, the recommended steps to provide secure access to the S3 from the application tier running on EC2 inside a VPC are to configure a VPC gateway endpoint for S3 within the VPC (option A) and create a bucket policy that limits access to only the application tier running in the VPC (option C).

Question 914
A company recently migrated a monolithic application to an Amazon EC2 instance and Amazon RDS. The application has tightly coupled modules. The existing design of the application gives the application the ability to run on only a single EC2 instance.
The company has noticed high CPU utilization on the EC2 instance during peak usage times. The high CPU utilization corresponds to degraded performance on Amazon RDS for read requests. The company wants to reduce the high CPU utilization and improve read request performance.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Resize the EC2 instance to an EC2 instance type that has more CPU capacity. Configure an Auto Scaling group with a minimum and maximum size of 1. Configure an RDS read replica for read requests.
B.
Resize the EC2 instance to an EC2 instance type that has more CPU capacity. Configure an Auto Scaling group with a minimum and maximum size of 1. Add an RDS read replica and redirect all read/write traffic to the replica.
C.
Configure an Auto Scaling group with a minimum size of 1 and maximum size of 2. Resize the RDS DB instance to an instance type that has more CPU capacity.
D.
Resize the EC2 instance to an EC2 instance type that has more CPU capacity. Configure an Auto Scaling group with a minimum and maximum size of 1. Resize the RDS DB instance to an instance type that has more CPU capacity.

Answer: A

Explanation:
Option B incorrectly suggests redirecting all read/write traffic to the replica. RDS read replicas are designed to handle read operations only, not write operations. Writes must still be handled by the primary DB instance

Question 915

Explanation:

Question 916
A company hosts a monolithic web application on an Amazon EC2 instance. Application users have recently reported poor performance at specific times. Analysis of Amazon CloudWatch metrics shows that CPU utilization is 100% during the periods of poor performance.
The company wants to resolve this performance issue and improve application availability.
Which combination of steps will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively? (Choose two.)
A.
Use AWS Compute Optimizer to obtain a recommendation for an instance type to scale vertically.
B.
Create an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) from the web server. Reference the AMI in a new launch template.
C.
Create an Auto Scaling group and an Application Load Balancer to scale vertically.
D.
Use AWS Compute Optimizer to obtain a recommendation for an instance type to scale horizontally.
E.
Create an Auto Scaling group and an Application Load Balancer to scale horizontally.

Answer: AE?BE?

Explanation:
AE
AWS Compute Optimizer analyzes your current EC2 instance usage and recommends the most cost-effective instance type. In this case, the current instance may not have enough CPU capacity, so scaling vertically (upgrading to a larger instance type) could provide immediate relief from the 100% CPU utilization.

BE
BE makes more sense to me. Vertical scaling increases cost continuously even when the instance is in low demand. for a long run, the cost would be higher than just scale horizontally. The questions says the 'poor performance at specific times', so we just need to scale up at specific times. 
Additionally, in order to scale up, we do need AMI and a launch template. Thus, a combination of B & E should be the correct answer

Question 917

Question 918
A company needs to implement a new data retention policy for regulatory compliance. As part of this policy, sensitive documents that are stored in an Amazon S3 bucket must be protected from deletion or modification for a fixed period of time.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Activate S3 Object Lock on the required objects and enable governance mode.
B.
Activate S3 Object Lock on the required objects and enable compliance mode.
C.
Enable versioning on the S3 bucket. Set a lifecycle policy to delete the objects after a specified period.
D.
Configure an S3 Lifecycle policy to transition objects to S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval for the retention duration.

Answer: B

Explanation:
S3 Object Lock:
- This feature allows you to lock objects in an S3 bucket, preventing them from being deleted or modified for a specified retention period.
Compliance mode:
- When enabled, S3 Object Lock in compliance mode provides the most stringent protection, ensuring that once an object is locked, even the account root user cannot delete or modify it, making it ideal for regulatory compliance scenarios where data must be preserved for a fixed period

Question 919

Question 920
A company is building an application in the AWS Cloud. The application is hosted on Amazon EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB). The company uses Amazon Route 53 for the DNS.
The company needs a managed solution with proactive engagement to detect against DDoS attacks.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Enable AWS Config. Configure an AWS Config managed rule that detects DDoS attacks.
B.
Enable AWS WAF on the ALCreate an AWS WAF web ACL with rules to detect and prevent DDoS attacks. Associate the web ACL with the ALB.
C.
Store the ALB access logs in an Amazon S3 bucket. Configure Amazon GuardDuty to detect and take automated preventative actions for DDoS attacks.
D.
Subscribe to AWS Shield Advanced. Configure hosted zones in Route 53. Add ALB resources as protected resources.

Answer: D

Explanation:
Shield Advanced signals a DDoS detection and starts analyzing the traffic for an attack signature. If a signature is found, it is first tested on past traffic to reduce the risk of false positive, then if it's safe to use it, a corresponding WAF rule is placed in the previously created rule group. After a certain time, when the attack is stopped, the rule is automatically removed from the rule group. When successful, this process takes several minutes.

Question 921
A company hosts a video streaming web application in a VPC. The company uses a Network Load Balancer (NLB) to handle TCP traffic for real-time data processing. There have been unauthorized attempts to access the application.
The company wants to improve application security with minimal architectural change to prevent unauthorized attempts to access the application.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Implement a series of AWS WAF rules directly on the NLB to filter out unauthorized traffic.
B.
Recreate the NLB with a security group to allow only trusted IP addresses.
C.
Deploy a second NLB in parallel with the existing NLB configured with a strict IP address allow list.
D.
Use AWS Shield Advanced to provide enhanced DDoS protection and prevent unauthorized access attempts.

Answer: B?D?

Explanation:
B
Real-time data processing normally use RTP Protocol which uses a range of ports to deliver audio and video streams. It doesn't specifically says HTTPS so i assume, it can't use WAF to control the traffic since it operates in HTTP/HTTPS Level only.
Not designed for real-time:
HTTP is primarily designed for request-response communication, which involves sending a request and then waiting for a full response, making it less efficient for continuous data streams needed in real-time applications

D
The answer should be D. It makes no sense to pick B for a public app in cases of DDoS, SGs wouldn't help with that. It's like, the closer the questions end, the more trolls left.

Question 922
A healthcare company is developing an AWS Lambda function that publishes notifications to an encrypted Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic. The notifications contain protected health information (PHI).
The SNS topic uses AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer managed keys for encryption. The company must ensure that the application has the necessary permissions to publish messages securely to the SNS topic.
Which combination of steps will meet these requirements? (Choose three.)
A.
Create a resource policy for the SNS topic that allows the Lambda function to publish messages to the topic.
B.
Use server-side encryption with AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS) for the SNS topic instead of customer managed keys.
C.
Create a resource policy for the encryption key that the SNS topic uses that has the necessary AWS KMS permissions.
D.
Specify the Lambda function's Amazon Resource Name (ARN) in the SNS topic's resource policy.
E.
Associate an Amazon API Gateway HTTP API with the SNS topic to control access to the topic by using API Gateway resource policies.
F.
Configure a Lambda execution role that has the necessary IAM permissions to use a customer managed key in AWS KMS.

Answer: ACF?ADF?

Explanation:
ADF
#A: This is essential because the resource policy on the SNS topic will define which entities (like the Lambda function) are allowed to publish messages to it.
#D: By specifying the Lambda function's ARN in the SNS topic policy, you clearly grant access only to that specific Lambda function.
#F: Since the SNS topic uses a customer-managed KMS key, the Lambda execution role must have the necessary permissions to use that key for encryption/decryption when publishing messages.

ACF
D is correct too and С is not clear, but seems like it is about KMS policy and adding permissions for sns service which has to be added in case of CMK

Question 923
A company runs an on-premises application that is powered by a MySQL database. The company is migrating the application to AWS to increase the application's elasticity and availability.
The current architecture shows heavy read activity on the database during times of normal operation. Every 4 hours, the company's development team pulls a full export of the production database to populate a database in the staging environment. During this period, users experience unacceptable application latency. The development team is unable to use the staging environment until the procedure completes.
A solutions architect must recommend replacement architecture that alleviates the application latency issue. The replacement architecture also must give the development team the ability to continue using the staging environment without delay.
Which solution meets these requirements?
A.
Use Amazon Aurora MySQL with Multi-AZ Aurora Replicas for production. Populate the staging database by implementing a backup and restore process that uses the mysqldump utility.
B.
Use Amazon Aurora MySQL with Multi-AZ Aurora Replicas for production. Use database cloning to create the staging database on-demand.
C.
Use Amazon RDS for MySQL with a Multi-AZ deployment and read replicas for production. Use the standby instance for the staging database.
D.
Use Amazon RDS for MySQL with a Multi-AZ deployment and read replicas for production. Populate the staging database by implementing a backup and restore process that uses the mysqldump utility.

Answer: B

Explanation:
A. Populating the staging database through a backup and restore process using the mysqldump utility would still result in delays and impact application latency.
B. With Aurora, you can create a clone of the production database quickly and efficiently, without the need for time-consuming backup and restore processes. The development team can spin up the staging database on-demand, eliminating delays and allowing them to continue using the staging environment without interruption.
C. Using the standby instance for the staging database would not provide the development team with the ability to use the staging environment without delay. The standby instance is designed for failover purposes and may not be readily available for immediate use.
D. Relying on a backup and restore process using the mysqldump utility would still introduce delays and impact application latency during the data population phase.

Question 924
A company has an employee web portal. Employees log in to the portal to view payroll details. The company is developing a new system to give employees the ability to upload scanned documents for reimbursement. The company runs a program to extract text-based data from the documents and attach the extracted information to each employee’s reimbursement IDs for processing.
The employee web portal requires 100% uptime. The document extract program runs infrequently throughout the day on an on-demand basis. The company wants to build a scalable and cost-effective new system that will require minimal changes to the existing web portal. The company does not want to make any code changes.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST implementation effort?
A.
Run Amazon EC2 On-Demand Instances in an Auto Scaling group for the web portal. Use an AWS Lambda function to run the document extract program. Invoke the Lambda function when an employee uploads a new reimbursement document.
B.
Run Amazon EC2 Spot Instances in an Auto Scaling group for the web portal. Run the document extract program on EC2 Spot Instances. Start document extract program instances when an employee uploads a new reimbursement document.
C.
Purchase a Savings Plan to run the web portal and the document extract program. Run the web portal and the document extract program in an Auto Scaling group.
D.
Create an Amazon S3 bucket to host the web portal. Use Amazon API Gateway and an AWS Lambda function for the existing functionalities. Use the Lambda function to run the document extract program. Invoke the Lambda function when the API that is associated with a new document upload is called.

Answer: A

Explanation:
This solution offers the most scalable and cost-effective approach with minimal changes to the existing web portal and no code modifications.
Why Not Other Options?:
Option B (Spot Instances): Spot Instances are not suitable for workloads requiring 100% uptime, as they can be terminated by AWS with short notice.
Option C (Savings Plan): A Savings Plan could reduce costs but does not address the requirement for running the document extraction program efficiently or without code changes.
Option D (S3 with API Gateway and Lambda): This would require significant changes to the existing web portal setup, including moving the portal to S3 and reconfiguring its architecture, which contradicts the requirement of minimal implementation effort and no code change.

Question 925
A media company has a multi-account AWS environment in the us-east-1 Region. The company has an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic in a production account that publishes performance metrics. The company has an AWS Lambda function in an administrator account to process and analyze log data.
The Lambda function that is in the administrator account must be invoked by messages from the SNS topic that is in the production account when significant metrics are reported.
Which combination of steps will meet these requirements? (Choose two.)
A.
Create an IAM resource policy for the Lambda function that allows Amazon SNS to invoke the function.
B.
Implement an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue in the administrator account to buffer messages from the SNS topic that is in the production account. Configure the SQS queue to invoke the Lambda function.
C.
Create an IAM policy for the SNS topic that allows the Lambda function to subscribe to the topic.
D.
Use an Amazon EventBridge rule in the production account to capture the SNS topic notifications. Configure the EventBridge rule to forward notifications to the Lambda function that is in the administrator account.
E.
Store performance metrics in an Amazon S3 bucket in the production account. Use Amazon Athena to analyze the metrics from the administrator account.

Answer: AC?AD?

Explanation:
AC
AWS services already exist only permissions are missing. A&C will set up the necessary permissions and subscriptions for cross-account invocation of the Lambda function by the SNS topic.

AD
#A: This is the most direct way to allow the SNS topic in the production account to trigger the Lambda function in the administrator account. By creating an IAM policy on the Lambda function that grants SNS permission to invoke it, you establish the necessary access control.
#D: Using an EventBridge rule in the production account allows you to filter and route the SNS notifications specifically to the Lambda function in the administrator account, providing greater control and flexibility over the event delivery .

Question 926
A company is migrating an application from an on-premises location to Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS). The company must use a custom subnet for pods that are in the company's VPC to comply with requirements. The company also needs to ensure that the pods can communicate securely within the pods' VPC.

Question 933
A company uses an Amazon RDS for MySQL instance. To prepare for end-of-year processing, the company added a read replica to accommodate extra read-only queries from the company's reporting tool. The read replica CPU usage was 60% and the primary instance CPU usage was 60%.
After end-of-year activities are complete, the read replica has a constant 25% CPU usage. The primary instance still has a constant 60% CPU usage. The company wants to rightsize the database and still provide enough performance for future growth.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Delete the read replica Do not make changes to the primary instance
B.
Resize the read replica to a smaller instance size Do not make changes to the primary instance
C.
Resize the read replica to a larger instance size Resize the primary instance to a smaller instance size
D.
Delete the read replica Resize the primary instance to a larger instance

Answer: B

Explanation:
Since the read replica is now underutilized with only 25% CPU usage, it can be resized to a smaller instance to save costs while still handling the reduced read queries. No changes to the primary instance are needed, as it is consistently running at 60% CPU usage, which is manageable, and the read replica will still offload read queries in the future.

Question 934
A company is designing an application where users upload small files into Amazon S3. After a user uploads a file, the file requires one-time simple processing to transform the data and save the data in JSON format for later analysis.
Each file must be processed as quickly as possible after it is uploaded. Demand will vary. On some days, users will upload a high number of files. On other days, users will upload a few files or no files.
Which solution meets these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?
A.
Configure Amazon EMR to read text files from Amazon S3. Run processing scripts to transform the data. Store the resulting JSON file in an Amazon Aurora DB cluster.
B.
Configure Amazon S3 to send an event notification to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Use Amazon EC2 instances to read from the queue and process the data. Store the resulting JSON file in Amazon DynamoDB.
C.
Configure Amazon S3 to send an event notification to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Use an AWS Lambda function to read from the queue and process the data. Store the resulting JSON file in Amazon DynamoDB.
D.
Configure Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) to send an event to Amazon Kinesis Data Streams when a new file is uploaded. Use an AWS Lambda function to consume the event from the stream and process the data. Store the resulting JSON file in an Amazon Aurora DB cluster.

Answer: C

Explanation:
A. Configuring EMR and an Aurora DB cluster for this use case would introduce unnecessary complexity and operational overhead. EMR is typically used for processing large datasets and running big data frameworks like Apache Spark or Hadoop.
B. While using S3 event notifications and SQS for decoupling is a good approach, using EC2 to process the data would introduce operational overhead in terms of managing and scaling the EC2.
D. Using EventBridge and Kinesis Data Streams for this use case would introduce additional complexity and operational overhead compared to the other options. EventBridge and Kinesis are typically used for real-time streaming and processing of large volumes of data.
In summary, option C is the recommended solution as it provides a serverless and scalable approach for processing uploaded files using S3 event notifications, SQS, and Lambda. It offers low operational overhead, automatic scaling, and efficient handling of varying demand. Storing the resulting JSON file in DynamoDB aligns with the requirement of saving the data for later analysis

Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Use server-side encryption with customer-provided keys (SSE-C)
B.
Use server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3)
C.
Use server-side encryption with AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS)
D.
Use server-side encryption with customer managed AWS KMS keys

Answer: C?D?

Explanation:
C
SSE keys provided usage fee application and there is no monthly charges, hence its a correct option.
D is highly cost option with monthly and usage fee. which is incorrect.

D
#1 Automatic key rotation: AWS KMS allows you to set up automatic key rotation for customer managed keys, which fulfills the requirement to rotate encryption keys yearly.
# 2 CloudTrail tracking: All KMS key operations are logged in CloudTrail, enabling you to track key rotation activity.
#3 Lowest cost: While using customer-provided keys (SSE-C) might seem cost-effective at first glance, managing your own keys adds complexity and can be more expensive in the long run.
#$ Compliance with security policies: Using customer managed KMS keys ensures that the company has full control over the encryption keys, meeting the stringent security requirements

Question 941
A company runs its production workload on an Amazon Aurora MySQL DB cluster that includes six Aurora Replicas. The company wants near-real-time reporting queries from one of its departments to be automatically distributed across three of the Aurora Replicas. Those three replicas have a different compute and memory specification from the rest of the DB cluster.
Which solution meets these requirements?
A.
Create and use a custom endpoint for the workload
B.
Create a three-node cluster clone and use the reader endpoint
C.
Use any of the instance endpoints for the selected three nodes
D.
Use the reader endpoint to automatically distribute the read-only workload

Answer: A

Explanation:
Using a Custom endpoint: This allows you to specify a specific set of Aurora replicas be used for the reporting queries, enabling you to target the three replicas with different compute and memory specifications while distributing the workload across them.

- #B. Create a three-node cluster clone and use the reader endpoint: While you can create a separate cluster, using the "reader endpoint" would distribute queries across all replicas in that cluster, not just the three you want to target with different specs.
- #C. Use any of the instance endpoints for the selected three nodes: This approach would require manual connection management to each specific replica, not providing automatic load balancing across the chosen three nodes.
- #D. Use the reader endpoint to automatically distribute the read-only workload: The standard "reader endpoint" distributes reads across all Aurora replicas in the cluster, not just the selected three with specific configurations.

Question 942

The company stores the credentials in a connection string in an environment variable on the server. The company wants to migrate its application to AWS and to replace the Node.js application server with AWS Lambda. The company also wants to migrate to Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL and to ensure that the database credentials are securely managed.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?
A.
Store the database credentials as a parameter in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store Configure Parameter Store to automatically rotate the secrets every 30 days. Update the Lambda function to retrieve the credentials from the parameter.
B.
Store the database credentials as a secret in AWS Secrets Manager. Configure Secrets Manager to automatically rotate the credentials every 30 days. Update the Lambda function to retrieve the credentials from the secret.
C.
Store the database credentials as an encrypted Lambda environment variable. Write a custom Lambda function to rotate the credentials. Schedule the Lambda function to run every 30 days.
D.
Store the database credentials as a key in AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS). Configure automatic rotation for the key. Update the Lambda function to retneve the credentials from the KMS key.

Answer: B

Explanation:
AWS Secrets Manager is specifically designed to store and manage sensitive information like database credentials. It provides built-in functionality for securely storing, retrieving, and automatically rotating credentials.
Automatic Rotation:
Secrets Manager can be configured to automatically rotate the database credentials at regular intervals (e.g., every 30 days). This reduces operational overhead by eliminating the need for manual credential rotation or custom rotation logic.
Integration with Lambda:
Lambda functions can easily retrieve credentials stored in Secrets Manager by calling the Secrets Manager API, which simplifies the application code and enhances security.

Question 943
A company wants to replicate existing and ongoing data changes from an on-premises Oracle database to Amazon RDS for Oracle. The amount of data to replicate varies throughout each day. The company wants to use AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) for data replication. The solution must allocate only the capacity that the replication instance requires.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Configure the AWS DMS replication instance with a Multi-AZ deployment to provision instances across multiple Availability Zones.
B.
Create an AWS DMS Serverless replication task to analyze and replicate the data while provisioning the required capacity.
C.
Use Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling to scale the size of the AWS DMS replication instance up or down based on the amount of data toreplicate.
D.
Provision AWS DMS replication capacity by using Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) with an AWS Fargate launch type to analyze and replicate the data while provisioning the required capacity.

Answer: B

Explanation:
AWS DMS Serverless is designed to automatically allocate and manage the necessary compute and memory resources based on the demand of the data replication workload. It scales capacity up or down according to the data replication requirements without manual intervention.
This approach ensures that the replication task uses only the required capacity at any given time, optimizing costs and resources, especially given that the amount of data to replicate varies throughout the day.

Question 944
A company has a multi-tier web application. The application's internal service components are deployed on Amazon EC2 instances. The internal service components need to access third-party software as a service (SaaS) APIs that are hosted on AWS.
The company needs to provide secure and private connectivity from the application's internal services to the third-party SaaS application. The company needs to ensure that there is minimal public internet exposure.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Implement an AWS Site-to-Site VPN to establish a secure connection with the third-party SaaS provider.
B.
Deploy AWS Transit Gateway to manage and route traffic between the application's VPC and the third-party SaaS provider.
C.
Configure AWS PrivateLink to allow only outbound traffic from the VPC without enabling the third-party SaaS provider to establish.
D.
Use AWS PrivateLink to create a private connection between the application's VPC and the third-party SaaS provider.

Answer: C?D?

Explanation:
C
2. Restrict Inbound Traffic via Security Groups:
To prevent the third-party SaaS provider from establishing inbound connections to your VPC, use Security Groups attached to the VPC Endpoint Interface.
Outbound Traffic Allowed: Ensure that your security groups allow outbound traffic to the SaaS provider’s IP ranges or endpoints.
Restrict Inbound Traffic: You should block all inbound traffic on the VPC Endpoint Interface by configuring the security group rules. For example:
Inbound Rules: Block all traffic (or leave it empty).
Outbound Rules: Allow outbound connections to the IP addresses or ports specified by the SaaS provider.

D
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/integrate-third-party-services/architecture-1.html
It is limited to only TCP traffic and unidirectional communication. The third-party workloads cannot initiate communication back to your account.

Question 945
An application allows users at a company's headquarters to access product data. The product data is stored in an Amazon RDS MySQL DB instance. The operations team has isolated an application performance slowdown and wants to separate read traffic from write traffic. A solutions architect needs to optimize the application's performance quickly.
What should the solutions architect recommend?
A.
Change the existing database to a Multi-AZ deployment. Serve the read requests from the primary Availability Zone.
B.
Change the existing database to a Multi-AZ deployment. Serve the read requests from the secondary Availability Zone.
C.
Create read replicas for the database. Configure the read replicas with half of the compute and storage resources as the source database.
D.
Create read replicas for the database. Configure the read replicas with the same compute and storage resources as the source database.

Answer: D

Explanation:
A. In a Multi-AZ deployment, a standby replica of the database is created in a different AZ for high availability and automatic failover purposes. However, serving read requests from the primary AZ alone would not effectively separate read and write traffic. Both read and write traffic would still be directed to the primary database instance, which might not fully optimize performance.
B. The secondary instance in a Multi-AZ deployment is intended for failover and backup purposes, not for actively serving read traffic. It operates in a standby mode and is not optimized for handling read queries efficiently.
C. Configuring the read replicas with half of the compute and storage resources as the source database might not be optimal. It's generally recommended to configure the read replicas with the same compute and storage resources as the source database to ensure they can handle the read workload effectively.
D. Configuring the read replicas with the same compute and storage resources as the source database ensures that they can handle the read workload efficiently and provide the required performance boost.

Question 946
A solutions architect needs to connect a company's corporate network to its VPC to allow on-premises access to its AWS resources. The solution must provide encryption of all traffic between the corporate network and the VPC at the network layer and the session layer. The solution also must provide security controls to prevent unrestricted access between AWS and the on-premises systems.
Which solution meets these requirements?
A.
Configure AWS Direct Connect to connect to the VPC. Configure the VPC route tables to allow and deny traffic between AWS and on premises as required.
B.
Create an IAM policy to allow access to the AWS Management Console only from a defined set of corporate IP addresses. Restrict user access based on job responsibility by using an IAM policy and roles.
C.
Configure AWS Site-to-Site VPN to connect to the VPConfigure route table entries to direct traffic from on premises to the VPConfigure instance security groups and network ACLs to allow only required traffic from on premises.
D.
Configure AWS Transit Gateway to connect to the VPC. Configure route table entries to direct traffic from on premises to the VPC. Configure instance security groups and network ACLs to allow only required traffic from on premises.

Answer: C

Explanation:
This is C, but not for all the reasons everyone is posting. D, also encrypts traffic and works at the network layer and also has security controls to prevent unrestricted access between AWS and on-premises systems.
So, if you thought D like I did initially you were very close. The reason it is C, is because C works at both the network and session layer while doing all the other requirements as well. Where as D only works at the network layer. 
Happy studying!

Question 947
A company has a custom application with embedded credentials that retrieves information from a database in an Amazon RDS for MySQL DB cluster. The company needs to make the application more secure with minimal programming effort. The company has created credentials on the RDS for MySQL database for the application user.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Store the credentials in AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS). Create keys in AWS KMS. Configure the application to load the database credentials from AWS KMS. Enable automatic key rotation
B.
Store the credentials in encrypted local storage. Configure the application to load the database credentials from the local storage. Set up a credentials rotation schedule by creating a cron job.
C.
Store the credentials in AWS Secrets Manager. Configure the application to load the database credentials from Secrets Manager. Set up a credentials rotation schedule by creating an AWS Lambda function for Secrets Manager.
D.
Store the credentials in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store. Configure the application to load the database credentials from Parameter Store. Set up a credentials rotation schedule in the RDS for MySQL database by using Parameter Store.

Answer: C

Explanation:
AWS Secrets Manager is designed specifically for managing and automatically rotating credentials, including database credentials, API keys, and other secrets. It provides a secure and centralized place to store credentials and allows applications to retrieve them securely without hardcoding them in the application.
Secrets Manager also offers built-in support for automatic rotation of credentials using Lambda functions, which reduces the manual effort needed for rotation and enhances security.
This approach requires minimal programming effort because the application only needs to be configured to retrieve the credentials from Secrets Manager instead of being embedded within the application code.

Question 948

Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?
A.
Create a new S3 bucket that uses server-side encryption with AWS KMS multi-Region keys (SSE-KMS). Configure Cross-Region Replication (CRR). Load the data into the new S3 bucket. Use Amazon Athena to query the data.
B.
Create a new S3 bucket that uses server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3). Configure Cross-Region Replication (CRR). Load the data into the new S3 bucket. Use Amazon RDS to query the data.
C.
Configure Cross-Region Replication (CRR) on the existing S3 bucket. Use server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3). Use Amazon Athena to query the data.
D.
Configure S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR) on the existing S3 bucket. Use server-side encryption with AWS KMS multi-Region keys (SSE-KMS). Use Amazon RDS to query the data.

Answer: A?C?

Explanation:
A
it gives us encryption with AWS KMS multi-Region keys

C
#1: Least operational overhead: Choosing "SSE-S3" over "SSE-KMS" minimizes operational overhead as it automatically manages encryption keys within S3, eliminating the need for additional KMS key management.
#2: Existing S3 bucket: Reusing the existing bucket avoids the extra step of creating a new one and migrating data.
#3: Athena for querying: Athena is a serverless solution ideal for querying large datasets stored in S3, aligning with the requirement for a serverless architecture.

Question 949
A company has a web application that has thousands of users. The application uses 8-10 user-uploaded images to generate AI images. Users can download the generated AI images once every 6 hours. The company also has a premium user option that gives users the ability to download the generated AI images anytime.
The company uses the user-uploaded images to run AI model training twice a year. The company needs a storage solution to store the images.
Which storage solution meets these requirements MOST cost-effectively?
A.
Move uploaded images to Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive. Move premium user-generated AI images to S3 Standard. Move non-premium user-generated AI images to S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA).
B.
Move uploaded images to Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive Move all generated AI images to S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval.
C.
Move uploaded images to Amazon S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA). Move premium user-generated AI images to S3 Standard. Move non-premium user-generated AI images to S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA).
D.
Move uploaded images to Amazon S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA). Move all generated AI images to S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval.

Answer: A?C?

Explanation:
A
S3 Glacier Deep Archive is the most cost-effective storage for long-term infrequently accessed data, ideal for the user-uploaded images used twice a year for AI training.
S3 Standard for premium user-generated AI images ensures fast access, which is needed for frequent downloads.
S3 Standard-IA for non-premium user-generated AI images is cost-effective for less frequent access, as it charges lower for storage but slightly more for retrieval, which fits the 6-hour download frequency.
Not C because, although S3 One Zone-IA is a lower-cost option as well it provides less durability because it stores data in only one Availability Zone. While it is cost-effective, it increases the risk of data loss for critical AI training data.
B and D is out 
S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval for all generated AI images would likely introduce unacceptable retrieval delays for premium users, as they require immediate access to download images

S3 One Zone-IA is a cost-effective storage option for images that are accessed infrequently but are still needed for AI model training twice a year. One Zone-IA stores data in a single Availability Zone, making it less expensive but still highly available within that zone. Premium users need frequent access to their AI-generated images so S3. Non-premium users access their AI-generated images less frequently (once every 6 hours) so S3 Standard-IA

Question 950
A company is developing machine learning (ML) models on AWS. The company is developing the ML models as independent microservices. The microservices fetch approximately 1 GB of model data from Amazon S3 at startup and load the data into memory. Users access the ML models through an asynchronous API. Users can send a request or a batch of requests.
The company provides the ML models to hundreds of users. The usage patterns for the models are irregular. Some models are not used for days or weeks. Other models receive batches of thousands of requests at a time.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Direct the requests from the API to a Network Load Balancer (NLB). Deploy the ML models as AWS Lambda functions that the NLB will invoke. Use auto scaling to scale the Lambda functions based on the traffic that the NLB receives.
B.
Direct the requests from the API to an Application Load Balancer (ALB). Deploy the ML models as Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) services that the ALB will invoke. Use auto scaling to scale the ECS cluster instances based on the traffic that the ALB receives.
C.
Direct the requests from the API into an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Deploy the ML models as AWS Lambda functions that SQS events will invoke. Use auto scaling to increase the number of vCPUs for the Lambda functions based on the size of the SQS queue.
D.
Direct the requests from the API into an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Deploy the ML models as Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) services that read from the queue. Use auto scaling for Amazon ECS to scale both the cluster capacity and number of the services based on the size of the SQS queue.

Answer: D

Explanation:
SQS Queue: Directing API requests to SQS decouples the API from ML processing, efficiently handles high traffic, and ensures reliable request processing without overloading the ML models.
Amazon ECS Services: Running ML models on ECS provides effective management of containerized applications, ideal for handling ML workloads.
Auto Scaling: ECS auto scales based on SQS queue size, adjusting container and cluster capacity to match demand, ensuring efficient handling of varying workloads.

Question 951
A company runs a web application on Amazon EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB). The application stores data in an Amazon Aurora MySQL DB cluster.
The company needs to create a disaster recovery (DR) solution. The acceptable recovery time for the DR solution is up to 30 minutes. The DR solution does not need to support customer usage when the primary infrastructure is healthy.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Deploy the DR infrastructure in a second AWS Region with an ALB and an Auto Scaling group. Set the desired capacity and maximum capacity of the Auto Scaling group to a minimum value. Convert the Aurora MySQL DB cluster to an Aurora global database. Configure Amazon Route 53 for an active-passive failover with ALB endpoints.
B.
Deploy the DR infrastructure in a second AWS Region with an ALUpdate the Auto Scaling group to include EC2 instances from the second Region. Use Amazon Route 53 to configure active-active failover. Convert the Aurora MySQL DB cluster to an Aurora global database.
C.
Back up the Aurora MySQL DB cluster data by using AWS Backup. Deploy the DR infrastructure in a second AWS Region with an ALB. Update the Auto Scaling group to include EC2 instances from the second Region. Use Amazon Route 53 to configure active-active failover. Create an Aurora MySQL DB cluster in the second Region Restore the data from the backup.
D.
Back up the infrastructure configuration by using AWS Backup. Use the backup to create the required infrastructure in a second AWS Region. Set the Auto Scaling group desired capacity to zero. Use Amazon Route 53 to configure active-passive failover. Convert the Aurora MySQL DB cluster to an Aurora global database.

Answer: A?D?

Explanation:
A
#1 - Active-passive failover: This aligns with the requirement of a DR solution that doesn't need to support customer usage during normal operations, meaning the secondary region only activates when a primary failure occurs.
# 2 - Minimal Auto Scaling group capacity: Setting the desired and maximum capacity to a minimum value ensures minimal cost when the DR infrastructure is not actively used.
# 3 - Aurora Global Database: Converting the Aurora cluster to a global database allows for fast failover to the secondary region, meeting the 30-minute recovery time objective.
#4 - Separate AWS Region: Deploying the DR infrastructure in a different region provides geographic redundancy, crucial for disaster recovery.

D
It Can be D, if this approach is implemented before the disaster. 
And "Set the Auto Scaling group desired capacity to zero" means that it supposed to be done before the disaster.

Question 954
A global ecommerce company runs its critical workloads on AWS. The workloads use an Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance that is configured for a Multi-AZ deployment.
Customers have reported application timeouts when the company undergoes database failovers. The company needs a resilient solution to reduce failover time.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Create an Amazon RDS Proxy. Assign the proxy to the DB instance.
B.
Create a read replica for the DB instance. Move the read traffic to the read replica.
C.
Enable Performance Insights. Monitor the CPU load to identify the timeouts.
D.
Take regular automatic snapshots. Copy the automatic snapshots to multiple AWS Regions.

Answer: A

Explanation:
Amazon RDS Proxy:
RDS Proxy is designed to manage connections to the database more efficiently. It can reduce the impact of failovers on the application by maintaining connections and transparently rerouting them to the standby instance during a failover event.
By using RDS Proxy, the failover time is reduced because the proxy minimizes the disruption that occurs when the database fails over, thus reducing application timeouts.

Question 955
A company has multiple Amazon RDS DB instances that run in a development AWS account. All the instances have tags to identify them as development resources. The company needs the development DB instances to run on a schedule only during business hours.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?
A.
Create an Amazon CloudWatch alarm to identify RDS instances that need to be stopped. Create an AWS Lambda function to start and stop the RDS instances.
B.
Create an AWS Trusted Advisor report to identify RDS instances to be started and stopped. Create an AWS Lambda function to start and stop the RDS instances.
C.
Create AWS Systems Manager State Manager associations to start and stop the RDS instances.
D.
Create an Amazon EventBridge rule that invokes AWS Lambda functions to start and stop the RDS instances.

Answer: D

Explanation:
To meet the requirement of running Amazon RDS DB instances only during business hours with the least operational overhead, the best solution would be:
D. Create an Amazon EventBridge rule that invokes AWS Lambda functions to start and stop the RDS instances. This approach allows you to automate the scheduling of start and stop actions using EventBridge rules, which can trigger Lambda functions based on a cron expression. This setup is straightforward and requires minimal ongoing management
Option C, which involves using AWS Systems Manager State Manager to start and stop the RDS instances, is indeed a viable solution. It allows you to automate the process of keeping your RDS instances in a desired state, such as starting and stopping them on a schedule12.
However, the reason Option D (using Amazon EventBridge with AWS Lambda) might be preferred for this scenario is due to its simplicity and flexibility. EventBridge rules can be easily configured with cron expressions to trigger Lambda functions, which can start and stop the RDS instances. This setup typically involves fewer steps and less configuration compared to setting up State Manager associations and IAM roles3.
Both options are valid, but Option D generally offers a more straightforward approach with potentially lower operational overhead

Question 956
An Amazon EC2 administrator created the following policy associated with an IAM group containing several users:

{ “Version”: “2012-10-17”,
“Statement”: [{
“Effect”: “Allow”,
“Action”: “ec2:TerminateInstances”,
“Resource”: “*”,
“Condition”: { “IPAddress”: {
“aws:SourceIP”: “10.100.100.0/24”
} } },
{ “Effect”: “Deny”,
“Action”: “ec2:*”,
“Resource”: “*”,
“Condition”: { “StringNotEquals”: {
“ec2:Region”:  “us-east-1” } } } } }

What is the effect of this policy?
A.
Users can terminate an EC2 instance in any AWS Region except us-east-1.
B.
Users can terminate an EC2 instance with the IP address 10.100.100.1 in the us-east-1 Region.
C.
Users can terminate an EC2 instance in the us-east-1 Region when the user's source IP is 10.100.100.254.
D.
Users cannot terminate an EC2 instance in the us-east-1 Region when the user's source IP is 10.100.100.254.

Answer: C?D?

Explanation:
1. Allow termination of any instance if user’s source IP address is 100.100.254.
2. Deny termination of instances that are not in the us-east-1 Combining this two, you get:
“Allow instance termination in the us-east-1 region if the user’s source IP address is 10.100.100.254. Deny termination operation on other regions.”

C
Here is how I interpreted this
first part: terminate instance is allowed for the given CIDR block
second part: deny all ec2 actions when region is not us-east-1
so second part is like double negative which means allow for us-east-1 region
You combine both (remember deny always take priority which is why this is written in double negative) and you get:
[allow us-east-region1 to do any action on ec2] when [action is terminate instance and CIDR block is match]
so C is the answer
D is there to confuse you with the double negative

D
Users cannot terminate an EC2 instance in the us-east-1 Region when the user's source IP is 10.100.100.254.
The policy contains two statements. The first statement allows users to terminate any EC2 instance as long as the user's source IP address is within the range of 10.100.100.0/24. 
The second statement denies all EC2 actions (indicated by the "ec2:" action) for all resources ("") except in the us-east-1 region. Since the second statement has a higher priority than the first statement, users who have a source IP address of 10.100.100.254 will not be able to terminate an EC2 instance in the us-east-1 region.

Question 957
A consumer survey company has gathered data for several years from a specific geographic region. The company stores this data in an Amazon S3 bucket in an AWS Region.
The company has started to share this data with a marketing firm in a new geographic region. The company has granted the firm's AWS account access to the S3 bucket. The company wants to minimize the data transfer costs when the marketing firm requests data from the S3 bucket.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Configure the Requester Pays feature on the company’s S3 bucket.
B.
Configure S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR) from the company’s S3 bucket to one of the marketing firm’s S3 buckets.
C.
Configure AWS Resource Access Manager to share the S3 bucket with the marketing firm AWS account.
D.
Configure the company’s S3 bucket to use S3 Intelligent-Tiering Sync the S3 bucket to one of the marketing firm’s S3 buckets.

Answer: A

Explanation:
A. Configuring the Requester Pays feature on the company's S3 bucket is the most appropriate solution. With Requester Pays, the marketing firm's AWS account will be responsible for the data transfer costs when accessing the data in the S3 bucket, minimizing the data transfer costs for the consumer survey company.
B. Configuring S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR) from the company's S3 bucket to one of the marketing firm's S3 buckets would not be the most cost-effective solution, as the company would still be responsible for the data transfer costs.

Question 958
A company uses AWS to host its public ecommerce website. The website uses an AWS Global Accelerator accelerator for traffic from the internet. The Global Accelerator accelerator forwards the traffic to an Application Load Balancer (ALB) that is the entry point for an Auto Scaling group.
The company recently identified a DDoS attack on the website. The company needs a solution to mitigate future attacks.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST implementation effort?
A.
Configure an AWS WAF web ACL for the Global Accelerator accelerator to block traffic by using rate-based rules
B.
Configure an AWS Lambda function to read the ALB metrics to block attacks by updating a VPC network ACL
C.
Configure an AWS WAF web ACL on the ALB to block traffic by using rate-based rules
D.
Configure an Amazon CloudFront distribution in front of the Global Accelerator accelerator

Answer: A?C?

Explanation:
A
AWS Global Accelerator (GA) can be used with AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF) to protect applications from web exploits and DDoS attacks: 
Block HTTP method and header attacks
GA, WAF, and the Application Load Balancer can block access to Layer 7 HTTP method and headers. WAF uses web access control list (web ACL) rules with the load balancer to evaluate incoming traffic and only forward requests that comply with the rules to the endpoint. 
Detect and mitigate web application layer request floods
GA can protect web applications running on Application Load Balancer, and when used with WAF, it can also detect and mitigate web application layer request floods. 
Prevent DDoS attacks

C
Answer is C.
Note: AWS Global Accelerator itself doesn't support AWS WAF.
WAF can be applied on ALB, API gateway or cloud front.

Question 959
A company uses an Amazon DynamoDB table to store data that the company receives from devices. The DynamoDB table supports a customer-facing website to display recent activity on customer devices. The company configured the table with provisioned throughput for writes and reads.
The company wants to calculate performance metrics for customer device data on a daily basis. The solution must have minimal effect on the table's provisioned read and write capacity.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Use an Amazon Athena SQL query with the Amazon Athena DynamoDB connector to calculate performance metrics on a recurring schedule.
B.
Use an AWS Glue job with the AWS Glue DynamoDB export connector to calculate performance metrics on a recurring schedule.
C.
Use an Amazon Redshift COPY command to calculate performance metrics on a recurring schedule.
D.
Use an Amazon EMR job with an Apache Hive external table to calculate performance metrics on a recurring schedule.

Answer: A?B?

Explanation:
A
Athena is a serverless interactive query service that allows you to run SQL queries directly on data in various storage systems, including DynamoDB, through the Athena DynamoDB connector.
This setup minimizes the impact on the provisioned read and write capacity of the DynamoDB table because the connector reads data efficiently without directly querying the table.
Performance Metrics Calculation:
Athena provides SQL capabilities to compute performance metrics on the data fetched via the DynamoDB connector.
The queries can be scheduled using Amazon EventBridge or other automation tools to run daily.
Minimal Operational Overhead:
Athena requires no infrastructure to manage, making it a low-maintenance solution.
It is cost-effective since you pay only for the queries you run.

B
Instead, the new AWS Glue DynamoDB export connector reads DynamoDB data from the snapshot, which is exported from DynamoDB tables. This approach has following benefits:
It doesn’t consume read capacity units of the source DynamoDB tables

Question 963
A company wants to create an Amazon EMR cluster that multiple teams will use. The company wants to ensure that each team’s big data workloads can access only the AWS services that each team needs to interact with. The company does not want the workloads to have access to Instance Metadata Service Version 2 (IMDSv2) on the cluster’s underlying EC2 instances.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Configure interface VPC endpoints for each AWS service that the teams need. Use the required interface VPC endpoints to submit the big data workloads.
B.
Create EMR runtime roles. Configure the cluster to use the runtime roles. Use the runtime roles to submit the big data workloads.
C.
Create an EC2 IAM instance profile that has the required permissions for each team. Use the instance profile to submit the big data workloads.
D.
Create an EMR security configuration that has the EnableApplicationScopedIAMRole option set to false. Use the security configuration to submit the big data workloads.

Answer: B

Explanation:
EMR Runtime Roles: By creating EMR runtime roles, you can assign specific IAM roles to individual EMR jobs or steps. Each role can have fine-grained permissions, allowing you to restrict access to only the AWS services each team needs. This provides a highly controlled environment where each team's workload operates under the principle of least privilege.
IMDSv2 Access: When using runtime roles, you do not rely on the EC2 instance profile for service access, thereby minimizing the need for the workloads to access the Instance Metadata Service. This can help in reducing the risk of unauthorized access to IMDSv2.

Question 964
A solutions architect is designing an application that helps users fill out and submit registration forms. The solutions architect plans to use a two-tier architecture that includes a web application server tier and a worker tier.
The application needs to process submitted forms quickly. The application needs to process each form exactly once. The solution must ensure that no data is lost.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Use an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) FIFO queue between the web application server tier and the worker tier to store and forward form data.
B.
Use an Amazon API Gateway HTTP API between the web application server tier and the worker tier to store and forward form data.
C.
Use an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) standard queue between the web application server tier and the worker tier to store and forward form data.
D.
Use an AWS Step Functions workflow. Create a synchronous workflow between the web application server tier and the worker tier that stores and forwards form data.

Answer: A

Explanation:
Unlike standard queues, FIFO queues don't introduce duplicate messages. FIFO queues help you avoid sending duplicates to a queue. If you retry the SendMessage action within the 5-minute deduplication interval, Amazon SQS doesn't introduce any duplicates into the queue.

Which solution will satisfy these requirements?
A.
Configure Amazon EFS storage and set the Active Directory domain for authentication.
B.
Create an SMB file share on an AWS Storage Gateway file gateway in two Availability Zones.
C.
Create an Amazon S3 bucket and configure Microsoft Windows Server to mount it as a volume.
D.
Create an Amazon FSx for Windows File Server file system on AWS and set the Active Directory domain for authentication.

Answer: D

Explanation:
A. EFS does not provide native integration with AD for access control. While you can configure EFS to work with AD, it requires additional setup and is not as straightforward as using a dedicated Windows file system like FSx for Windows File Server.
B. It may introduce additional complexity for this use case. Creating an SMB file share using AWS Storage Gateway would require maintaining the gateway and managing the synchronization between on-premises and AWS storage.
C. S3 does not natively provide the SMB file protocol required for MS SharePoint and Windows shared file storage. While it is possible to mount an S3 as a volume using 3rd-party tools or configurations, it is not the recommended.
D. FSx for Windows File Server is a fully managed, highly available file storage service that is compatible with MSWindows shared file storage requirements. It provides native integration with AD, allowing for seamless access control and authentication using existing AD user accounts.

Question 968
A company that is in the ap-northeast-1 Region has a fleet of thousands of AWS Outposts servers. The company has deployed the servers at remote locations around the world. All the servers regularly download new software versions that consist of 100 files. There is significant latency before all servers run the new software versions.
The company must reduce the deployment latency for new software versions.
Which solution will meet this requirement with the LEAST operational overhead?
A.
Create an Amazon S3 bucket in ap-northeast-1. Set up an Amazon CloudFront distribution in ap-northeast-1 that includes a CachingDisabled cache policy. Configure the S3 bucket as the origin. Download the software by using signed URLs.
B.
Create an Amazon S3 bucket in ap-northeast-1. Create a second S3 bucket in the us-east-1 Region. Configure replication between the buckets. Set up an Amazon CloudFront distribution that uses ap-northeast-1 as the primary origin and us-east-1 as the secondary origin. Download the software by using signed URLs.
C.
Create an Amazon S3 bucket in ap-northeast-1. Configure Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration. Download the software by using the S3 Transfer Acceleration endpoint.
D.
Create an Amazon S3 bucket in ap-northeast-1. Set up an Amazon CloudFront distribution. Configure the S3 bucket as the origin. Download the software by using signed URLs.

Answer: D

Explanation:
By setting up a CloudFront distribution with the S3 bucket as the origin, the software versions can be cached at edge locations close to the remote AWS Outposts servers. This reduces the latency of downloading new software versions because the servers can access the content from the nearest CloudFront edge location instead of downloading it directly from the S3 bucket in the ap-northeast-1 Region.
About option C: S3 Transfer Acceleration optimizes the upload and download of files to S3 by routing through optimized network paths. However, it is primarily designed to improve performance when transferring data over long distances to S3 (uploads). It does not provide the same level of global caching and latency reduction as CloudFront for large-scale distribution.

Question 969
A company currently runs an on-premises stock trading application by using Microsoft Windows Server. The company wants to migrate the application to the AWS Cloud.
The company needs to design a highly available solution that provides low-latency access to block storage across multiple Availability Zones.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST implementation effort?
A.
Configure a Windows Server cluster that spans two Availability Zones on Amazon EC2 instances. Install the application on both cluster nodes. Use Amazon FSx for Windows File Server as shared storage between the two cluster nodes.
B.
Configure a Windows Server cluster that spans two Availability Zones on Amazon EC2 instances. Install the application on both cluster nodes. Use Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) General Purpose SSD (gp3) volumes as storage attached to the EC2 instances. Set up application-level replication to sync data from one EBS volume in one Availability Zone to another EBS volume in the second Availability Zone.
C.
Deploy the application on Amazon EC2 instances in two Availability Zones. Configure one EC2 instance as active and the second EC2 instance in standby mode. Use an Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP Multi-AZ file system to access the data by using Internet Small Computer Systems Interface (iSCSI) protocol.
D.
Deploy the application on Amazon EC2 instances in two Availability Zones. Configure one EC2 instance as active and the second EC2 instance in standby mode. Use Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) Provisioned IOPS SSD (io2) volumes as storage attached to the EC2 instances. Set up Amazon EBS level replication to sync data from one io2 volume in one Availability Zone to another io2 volume in the second Availability Zone.

Answer: A?C?D?

Explanation:
A
Amazon FSx for Windows File Server provides fully managed shared storage designed for Windows workloads. It offers seamless integration with Windows applications and supports Windows Server Failover Clustering (WSFC), making it the ideal choice for clustering applications.
High availability is provided as the cluster spans multiple Availability Zones, ensuring that the application continues to function in case of an AZ failure.
Low-latency access to shared block storage is achievable with FSx, and it reduces the complexity compared to setting up replication between multiple Amazon EBS volumes.
Least implementation effort: You don't need to manage block-level replication or create complex replication setups between AZs, as FSx for Windows File Server handles this automatically. It simplifies storage management and offers native Windows support.

D. Deploying the application on EC2 instances and using Amazon EBS Provisioned IOPS SSD (io2) volumes with EBS-level replication is the solution with the least implementation effort for the following reasons:
EBS volumes provide the required block storage for the application.
Using EBS-level replication to sync data between Availability Zones is a built-in feature, requiring less implementation effort compared to setting up custom replication mechanisms.
Provisioned IOPS SSD (io2) volumes ensure the low-latency access to the block storage required by the application.
By using Amazon EBS Provisioned IOPS SSD (io2) volumes with EBS-level replication, the company can meet the requirements for high availability and low-latency access to block storage with the least implementation effort.

Question 970
A company is designing a web application with an internet-facing Application Load Balancer (ALB).
The company needs the ALB to receive HTTPS web traffic from the public internet. The ALB must send only HTTPS traffic to the web application servers hosted on the Amazon EC2 instances on port 443. The ALB must perform a health check of the web application servers over HTTPS on port 8443.
Which combination of configurations of the security group that is associated with the ALB will meet these requirements? (Choose three.)
A.
Allow HTTPS inbound traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 for port 443.
B.
Allow all outbound traffic to 0.0.0.0/0 for port 443.
C.
Allow HTTPS outbound traffic to the web application instances for port 443.
D.
Allow HTTPS inbound traffic from the web application instances for port 443.
E.
Allow HTTPS outbound traffic to the web application instances for the health check on port 8443.
F.
Allow HTTPS inbound traffic from the web application instances for the health check on port 8443.

Answer: ACE

Explanation:
This question is poorly worded: assuming that, by default in security groups, all OUTBOUND connections are ALLOWE and all INBOUND connections are DENIED, options C and E would not even need to be configured. What would be needed is to create a security group for the EC2 instances allowing INBOUND connections from the ALB security group to the EC2 instances security group on ports 443 and 8443.

A. This allows the ALB to receive HTTPS traffic from the public internet.
C. This ensures that the ALB can send HTTPS traffic to the web application servers.
E. This allows the ALB to perform health checks on the web application servers over HTTPS on port 8443.

Question 971
A company hosts an application on AWS. The application gives users the ability to upload photos and store the photos in an Amazon S3 bucket. The company wants to use Amazon CloudFront and a custom domain name to upload the photo files to the S3 bucket in the eu-west-1 Region.
Which solution will meet these requirements? (Choose two.)
A.
Use AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) to create a public certificate in the us-east-1 Region. Use the certificate in CloudFront.
B.
Use AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) to create a public certificate in eu-west-1. Use the certificate in CloudFront.
C.
Configure Amazon S3 to allow uploads from CloudFront. Configure S3 Transfer Acceleration.
D.
Configure Amazon S3 to allow uploads from CloudFront origin access control (OAC).
E.
Configure Amazon S3 to allow uploads from CloudFront. Configure an Amazon S3 website endpoint.

Answer: AD

Explanation:
Amazon CloudFront requires an SSL/TLS certificate to use HTTPS with a custom domain name. This certificate MUST be provisioned in the us-east-1 Region, regardless of where your content is hosted. This is because CloudFront only supports certificates in the us-east-1 Region for use with custom domain names.
Origin Access Control (OAC) is a feature that allows you to securely upload content to an S3 bucket using CloudFront. It provides fine-grained access control and ensures that only CloudFront can upload files to the S3 bucket, preventing direct access. Configuring S3 to allow uploads from CloudFront using OAC ensures that only CloudFront can interact with the S3 bucket, adding an extra layer of security.

Question 972
A weather forecasting company collects temperature readings from various sensors on a continuous basis. An existing data ingestion process collects the readings and aggregates the readings into larger Apache Parquet files.

B.
Configure encryption at rest for Amazon RDS for MySQL by using AWS KMS managed keys. Configure IPsec tunnels for encryption in transit.
C.
Implement third-party application-level data encryption before storing data in Amazon RDS for MySQL. Configure AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) SSL/TLS certificates for encryption in transit.
D.
Configure encryption at rest for Amazon RDS for MySQL by using AWS KMS managed keys. Configure a VPN connection to enable private connectivity to encrypt data in transit.

Answer: A

Explanation:
Amazon RDS for MySQL supports encryption at rest using AWS Key Management Service (KMS) managed keys. This encryption is easy to enable during the creation of the RDS instance and requires minimal configuration. AWS KMS provides a fully managed solution for managing encryption keys, and using KMS managed keys reduces operational overhead related to key management and rotation.
Encryption in transit ensures that data transmitted between the application and the RDS database is secure. AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) can be used to provide SSL/TLS certificates, which are required to encrypt data in transit. ACM simplifies the management of SSL/TLS certificates by handling certificate renewal and deployment, reducing operational overhead.

Question 975

So option B is correct

Question 977
An image-processing company has a web application that users use to upload images. The application uploads the images into an Amazon S3 bucket. The company has set up S3 event notifications to publish the object creation events to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) standard queue. The SQS queue serves as the event source for an AWS Lambda function that processes the images and sends the results to users through email.
Users report that they are receiving multiple email messages for every uploaded image. A solutions architect determines that SQS messages are invoking the Lambda function more than once, resulting in multiple email messages.
What should the solutions architect do to resolve this issue with the LEAST operational overhead?
A.
Set up long polling in the SQS queue by increasing the ReceiveMessage wait time to 30 seconds.
B.
Change the SQS standard queue to an SQS FIFO queue. Use the message deduplication ID to discard duplicate messages.
C.
Increase the visibility timeout in the SQS queue to a value that is greater than the total of the function timeout and the batch window timeout.
D.
Modify the Lambda function to delete each message from the SQS queue immediately after the message is read before processing.

Answer: C

Explanation:
A. Long polling doesn't directly address the issue of multiple invocations of the Lambda for the same message. Increasing the ReceiveMessage may not completely prevent duplicate invocations.
B. Changing the queue type from standard to FIFO requires additional considerations and changes to the application architecture. It may involve modifying the event configuration and handling message deduplication IDs, which can introduce operational overhead.
D. Deleting messages immediately after reading them may lead to message loss if the Lambda encounters an error or fails to process the image successfully. It does not guarantee message processing and can result in data loss.
C. By setting the visibility timeout to a value greater than the total time required for the Lambda to process the image and send the email, you ensure that the message is not made visible to other consumers during processing. This prevents duplicate invocations of the Lambda for the same message.

Question 978
A company is building a cloud-based application on AWS that will handle sensitive customer data. The application uses Amazon RDS for the database, Amazon S3 for object storage, and S3 Event Notifications that invoke AWS Lambda for serverless processing.
The company uses AWS IAM Identity Center to manage user credentials. The development, testing, and operations teams need secure access to Amazon RDS and Amazon S3 while ensuring the confidentiality of sensitive customer data. The solution must comply with the principle of least privilege.
Which solution meets these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?
A.
Use IAM roles with least privilege to grant all the teams access. Assign IAM roles to each team with customized IAM policies defining specific permission for Amazon RDS and S3 object access based on team responsibilities.
B.
Enable IAM Identity Center with an Identity Center directory. Create and configure permission sets with granular access to Amazon RDS and Amazon S3. Assign all the teams to groups that have specific access with the permission sets.
C.
Create individual IAM users for each member in all the teams with role-based permissions. Assign the IAM roles with predefined policies for RDS and S3 access to each user based on user needs. Implement IAM Access Analyzer for periodic credential evaluation.
D.
Use AWS Organizations to create separate accounts for each team. Implement cross-account IAM roles with least privilege. Grant specific permission for RDS and S3 access based on team roles and responsibilities.

Answer: B

Explanation:
IAM Identity Center: This service simplifies user management by centralizing credentials and access control.
Permission Sets: You can create granular permission sets that align with the principle of least privilege, ensuring that each team has only the access they need.
Group Assignments: By assigning teams to groups with specific permission sets, you streamline access management and reduce the complexity of individual user permissions.
This approach minimizes operational overhead while maintaining secure and compliant access to sensitive customer data

Question 979
A company is implementing a shared storage solution for a gaming application that is hosted in an on-premises data center. The company needs the ability to use Lustre clients to access data. The solution must be fully managed.
Which solution meets these requirements?
A.
Create an AWS Storage Gateway file gateway. Create a file share that uses the required client protocol. Connect the application server to the file share.
B.
Create an Amazon EC2 Windows instance. Install and configure a Windows file share role on the instance. Connect the application server to the file share.
C.
Create an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file system, and configure it to support Lustre. Attach the file system to the origin server. Connect the application server to the file system.
D.
Create an Amazon FSx for Lustre file system. Attach the file system to the origin server. Connect the application server to the file system.

Answer: D

Explanation:
A. Lustre client access is not supported by AWS Storage Gateway file gateway.
B. Creating a Windows file share on an EC2 Windows instance is suitable for Windows-based file sharing, but it does not provide the required Lustre client access. Lustre is a high-performance parallel file system primarily used in high-performance computing (HPC) environments.
C. EFS does not natively support Lustre client access. Although EFS is a managed file storage service, it is designed for general-purpose file storage and is not optimized for Lustre workloads.
D. Amazon FSx for Lustre is a fully managed file system optimized for high-performance computing workloads, including Lustre clients. It provides the ability to use Lustre clients to access data in a managed and scalable manner. By choosing this option, the company can benefit from the performance and manageability of Amazon FSx for Lustre while meeting the requirement of Lustre client access.

Question 980
A company is planning to migrate a legacy application to AWS. The application currently uses NFS to communicate to an on-premises storage solution to store application data. The application cannot be modified to use any other communication protocols other than NFS for this purpose.
Which storage solution should a solutions architect recommend for use after the migration?
A.
AWS DataSync
B.
Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS)
C.
Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS)
D.
Amazon EMR File System (Amazon EMRFS)

Answer: C

Amazon EFS is the only one which provides a fully managed NFS file system

Question 981
A company uses GPS trackers to document the migration patterns of thousands of sea turtles. The trackers check every 5 minutes to see if a turtle has moved more than 100 yards (91.4 meters). If a turtle has moved, its tracker sends the new coordinates to a web application running on three Amazon EC2 instances that are in multiple Availability Zones in one AWS Region.
Recently, the web application was overwhelmed while processing an unexpected volume of tracker data. Data was lost with no way to replay the events. A solutions architect must prevent this problem from happening again and needs a solution with the least operational overhead.
What should the solutions architect do to meet these requirements?
A.
Create an Amazon S3 bucket to store the data. Configure the application to scan for new data in the bucket for processing.
B.
Create an Amazon API Gateway endpoint to handle transmitted location coordinates. Use an AWS Lambda function to process each item concurrently.
C.
Create an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue to store the incoming data. Configure the application to poll for new messages for processing.
D.
Create an Amazon DynamoDB table to store transmitted location coordinates. Configure the application to query the table for new data for processing. Use TTL to remove data that has been processed.

Answer: C

Explanation:
Amazon SQS is a fully managed message queuing service that allows you to decouple and scale applications by buffering the incoming data. This would ensure that data is stored in a reliable, scalable queue until the web application is ready to process it.
SQS provides high availability and fault tolerance, and guarantees that no data will be lost, as the messages remain in the queue until they are processed.
The web application can poll the SQS queue for new messages and process them at its own pace, preventing the application from being overwhelmed by large volumes of tracker data.
Operational overhead is minimal because SQS is a fully managed service. The application only needs to poll the queue for messages, and there is no need to manage infrastructure.

Question 982
A company's software development team needs an Amazon RDS Multi-AZ cluster. The RDS cluster will serve as a backend for a desktop client that is deployed on premises. The desktop client requires direct connectivity to the RDS cluster.
The company must give the development team the ability to connect to the cluster by using the client when the team is in the office.
Which solution provides the required connectivity MOST securely?
A.
Create a VPC and two public subnets. Create the RDS cluster in the public subnets. Use AWS Site-to-Site VPN with a customer gateway in the company's office.
B.
Create a VPC and two private subnets. Create the RDS cluster in the private subnets. Use AWS Site-to-Site VPN with a customer gateway in the company's office.
C.
Create a VPC and two private subnets. Create the RDS cluster in the private subnets. Use RDS security groups to allow the company's office IP ranges to access the cluster.
D.
Create a VPC and two public subnets. Create the RDS cluster in the public subnets. Create a cluster user for each developer. Use RDS security groups to allow the users to access the cluster.

Answer: B

Explanation:
VPC and Private Subnets: By placing the RDS cluster in private subnets, you ensure that the RDS cluster is not publicly accessible from the internet. This significantly improves security as the database is only accessible through secure channels, not directly from the public internet.
AWS Site-to-Site VPN: Using a Site-to-Site VPN establishes a secure, encrypted connection between the on-premises office and the AWS environment. This provides secure access to the RDS cluster without exposing it to the internet, ensuring that the developers can only access the cluster when connected to the office network.
Customer Gateway: The customer gateway is configured in the company's office to handle the VPN connection, providing secure connectivity for the desktop client to the RDS cluster when the development team is in the office.

Question 983
A solutions architect is creating an application that will handle batch processing of large amounts of data. The input data will be held in Amazon S3 and the output data will be stored in a different S3 bucket. For processing, the application will transfer the data over the network between multiple Amazon EC2 instances.
What should the solutions architect do to reduce the overall data transfer costs?
A.
Place all the EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group.
B.
Place all the EC2 instances in the same AWS Region.
C.
Place all the EC2 instances in the same Availability Zone.
D.
Place all the EC2 instances in private subnets in multiple Availability Zones.

Answer: C

Explanation:
After research it seems C make sense since it is saying data transfer between EC2 and data transfter between two EC2 in AZ is free but not between AZ's.
No cost within AZ: Data transfer between EC2 instances in the same AZ is free. 
Cross-AZ charges: If you transfer data between instances in different Availability Zones, you will be charged for the inter-zone data transfer. 
Region-based pricing: While data transfer within an AZ is free, data transfer across different regions may also incur charges

Question 992
A company recently launched a new application for its customers. The application runs on multiple Amazon EC2 instances across two Availability Zones. End users use TCP to communicate with the application.
The application must be highly available and must automatically scale as the number of users increases.
Which combination of steps will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively? (Choose two.)
A.
Add a Network Load Balancer in front of the EC2 instances.
B.
Configure an Auto Scaling group for the EC2 instances.
C.
Add an Application Load Balancer in front of the EC2 instances.
D.
Manually add more EC2 instances for the application.
E.
Add a Gateway Load Balancer in front of the EC2 instances.

Answer: AB?BC?

Explanation:
This is A and B. TCP best option is NLB. I know tons of you want to use chat GPT and it's going to tell you application load balancer, then ask chatgpt if an application load balancer really is the best option for TCP and it will be like "aw dang dawg, its not, you're right". Then it will switch to A and B. Because chatgpt doesn't know everything. It's a great tool but you still need to research because it doesn't have all the answers.

You are wrong! The question says, what will be the most cost effective way. ALB is much cheaper than the NLB. Thus, the best way to use NLB is when your application requires TCP and UDP connection. In this scenario, the users only communicate using TCP, which the ALB supports including variety of protocols such as, HTTP, HTTPS & SSL. 
Additionally, ALB's service uptime is up to 99.995%, which falls to the requirement of this question that application must be highly available... and that nullifies your logic!
Correct answer is C

Question 993
A company is testing an application that runs on an Amazon EC2 Linux instance. A single 500 GB Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) General Purpose SSO (gp2) volume is attached to the EC2 instance.
The company will deploy the application on multiple EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group. All instances require access to the data that is stored in the EBS volume. The company needs a highly available and resilient solution that does not introduce significant changes to the application's code.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Provision an EC2 instance that uses NFS server software. Attach a single 500 GB gp2 EBS volume to the instance.
B.
Provision an Amazon FSx for Windows File Server file system. Configure the file system as an SMB file store within a single Availability Zone.
C.
Provision an EC2 instance with two 250 GB Provisioned IOPS SSD EBS volumes.
D.
Provision an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file system. Configure the file system to use General Purpose performance mode.

Answer: D

Explanation:
#1 - Highly Available and Scalable: EFS is a managed file system designed for high availability and can automatically scale to accommodate the needs of multiple EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group, which perfectly aligns with the company's requirement.
# 2 - No code changes: Since EFS is a network file system, the application doesn't need significant code changes to access the data stored on it, as it can mount the file system like a local disk.
#3 - General Purpose performance mode: This mode provides a balance between cost and performance, suitable for most application workloads.

Question 995
A company hosts its main public web application in one AWS Region across multiple Availability Zones. The application uses an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group and an Application Load Balancer (ALB).
A web development team needs a cost-optimized compute solution to improve the company’s ability to serve dynamic content globally to millions of customers.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution. Configure the existing ALB as the origin.
B.
Use Amazon Route 53 to serve traffic to the ALB and EC2 instances based on the geographic location of each customer.
C.
Create an Amazon S3 bucket with public read access enabled. Migrate the web application to the S3 bucket. Configure the S3 bucket for website hosting.
D.
Use AWS Direct Connect to directly serve content from the web application to the location of each customer.

Answer: A

Explanation:
CloudFront:
is a content delivery network (CDN) service from AWS, designed to distribute content globally at high speeds by caching content in edge locations close to users. This is the most cost-effective way to serve dynamic content globally, which is exactly what the scenario requires.
ALB as the origin:
By setting the existing ALB as the origin for CloudFront, the CDN will fetch content from the web application running on the EC2 instances behind the ALB, effectively caching and delivering content from geographically closer locations to users

Question 996
A company hosts its core network services, including directory services and DNS, in its on-premises data center. The data center is connected to the AWS Cloud using AWS Direct Connect (DX). Additional AWS accounts are planned that will require quick, cost-effective, and consistent access to these network services.
What should a solutions architect implement to meet these requirements with the LEAST amount of operational overhead?
A.
Create a DX connection in each new account. Route the network traffic to the on-premises servers.
B.
Configure VPC endpoints in the DX VPC for all required services. Route the network traffic to the on-premises servers.
C.
Create a VPN connection between each new account and the DX VPRoute the network traffic to the on-premises servers.
D.
Configure AWS Transit Gateway between the accounts. Assign DX to the transit gateway and route network traffic to the on-premises servers.

Answer: D

Explanation:

Question 997
A company has an Amazon S3 bucket that contains sensitive data files. The company has an application that runs on virtual machines in an on-premises data center. The company currently uses AWS IAM Identity Center.
The application requires temporary access to files in the S3 bucket. The company wants to grant the application secure access to the files in the S3 bucket.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Create an S3 bucket policy that permits access to the bucket from the public IP address range of the company’s on-premises data center.
B.
Use IAM Roles Anywhere to obtain security credentials in IAM Identity Center that grant access to the S3 bucket. Configure the virtual machines to assume the role by using the AWS CLI.
C.
Install the AWS CLI on the virtual machine. Configure the AWS CLI with access keys from an IAM user that has access to the bucket.
D.
Create an IAM user and policy that grants access to the bucket. Store the access key and secret key for the IAM user in AWS Secrets Manager. Configure the application to retrieve the access key and secret key at startup.

Answer: B

Explanation:
AM Roles Anywhere allows on-premises servers and applications to obtain temporary AWS credentials and access AWS resources securely. This solution allows your on-premises virtual machines to use IAM roles without needing long-term credentials (like access keys). The virtual machines can assume roles and access the S3 bucket temporarily and securely.
Since the company is already using AWS IAM Identity Center, using IAM Roles Anywhere allows the company to leverage its existing Identity Center setup while following AWS best practices for security. This approach ensures the application can securely retrieve credentials without embedding static credentials into the application.

Question 998
A company hosts its application on several Amazon EC2 instances inside a VPC. The company creates a dedicated Amazon S3 bucket for each customer to store their relevant information in Amazon S3.
The company wants to ensure that the application running on EC2 instances can securely access only the S3 buckets that belong to the company’s AWS account.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?
A.
Create a gateway endpoint for Amazon S3 that is attached to the VPC. Update the IAM instance profile policy to provide access to only the specific buckets that the application needs.
B.
Create a NAT gateway in a public subnet with a security group that allows access to only Amazon S3. Update the route tables to use the NAT Gateway.
C.
Create a gateway endpoint for Amazon S3 that is attached to the VPUpdate the IAM instance profile policy with a Deny action and the following condition key:
D.
Create a NAT Gateway in a public subnet. Update route tables to use the NAT Gateway. Assign bucket policies for all buckets with a Deny action and the following condition key:

Answer: A?C?

Explanation:
C
B, C is not secure way because NAT gateway is for internet-facing outbound.
A is not correct because company will create dedicated bucket for each customers it means number of buckets will increase dynamically. so you cant list all on profile.

A
Option C will deny the other S3 buckets but will not Allow access to the specified Buckets, thus we should have Allow rules.
Option A will allow the specified Buckets and implicit Deny the other buckets.

Question 999
A company is designing a new internal web application in the AWS Cloud. The new application must securely retrieve and store multiple employee usernames and passwords from an AWS managed service.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?
A.
Store the employee credentials in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store. Use AWS CloudFormation and the BatchGetSecretValue API to retrieve usernames and passwords from Parameter Store.
B.
Store the employee credentials in AWS Secrets Manager. Use AWS CloudFormation and AWS Batch with the BatchGetSecretValue API to retrieve the usernames and passwords from Secrets Manager.
C.
Store the employee credentials in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store. Use AWS CloudFormation and AWS Batch with the BatchGetSecretValue API to retrieve the usernames and passwords from Parameter Store.
D.
Store the employee credentials in AWS Secrets Manager. Use AWS CloudFormation and the BatchGetSecretValue API to retrieve the usernames and passwords from Secrets Manager.

Answer: D

Explanation:
Option D is similar to option B, but option B unnecessarily introduces AWS Batch into the solution. AWS Batch is designed for executing batch jobs and is not required for the use case of retrieving secrets in a web application. This adds complexity and overhead without benefit.
