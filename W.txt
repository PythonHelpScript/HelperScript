Question 1
A company collects data for temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure in cities across multiple continents. The average volume of data that the company collects from each site daily is 500 GB. Each site has a high-speed Internet connection.
The company wants to aggregate the data from all these global sites as quickly as possible in a single Amazon S3 bucket. The solution must minimize operational complexity.
Which solution meets these requirements?
A.
Turn on S3 Transfer Acceleration on the destination S3 bucket. Use multipart uploads to directly upload site data to the destination S3 bucket.
B.
Upload the data from each site to an S3 bucket in the closest Region. Use S3 Cross-Region Replication to copy objects to the destination S3 bucket. Then remove the data from the origin S3 bucket.
C.
Schedule AWS Snowball Edge Storage Optimized device jobs daily to transfer data from each site to the closest Region. Use S3 Cross-Region Replication to copy objects to the destination S3 bucket.
D.
Upload the data from each site to an Amazon EC2 instance in the closest Region. Store the data in an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume. At regular intervals, take an EBS snapshot and copy it to the Region that contains the destination S3 bucket. Restore the EBS volume in that Region.

Answer: A

Question 2
A company is building an ecommerce web application on AWS. The application sends information about new orders to an Amazon API Gateway REST API to process. The company wants to ensure that orders are processed in the order that they are received.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Use an API Gateway integration to publish a message to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic when the application receives an order. Subscribe an AWS Lambda function to the topic to perform processing.
B.
Use an API Gateway integration to send a message to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) FIFO queue when the application receives an order. Configure the SQS FIFO queue to invoke an AWS Lambda function for processing.
C.
Use an API Gateway authorizer to block any requests while the application processes an order.
D.
Use an API Gateway integration to send a message to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) standard queue when the application receives an order. Configure the SQS standard queue to invoke an AWS Lambda function for processing.

Answer: B

Explanation:
- Amazon API Gateway will be used to receive the orders from the web application.
- Instead of directly processing the orders, the API Gateway will integrate with an Amazon SQS FIFO queue.
- FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queues in Amazon SQS ensure that messages are processed in the order they are received.
- By using a FIFO queue, the order processing is guaranteed to be sequential, ensuring that the first order received is processed before the next one.
- An AWS Lambda function can be configured to be triggered by the SQS FIFO queue, processing the orders as they arrive

To ensure that orders are processed in the order that they are received, the best solution is to use an Amazon SQS FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queue. This type of queue maintains the exact order in which messages are sent and received.
In this case, the application can send information about new orders to an Amazon API Gateway REST API, which can then use an API Gateway integration to send a message to an Amazon SQS FIFO queue for processing. The queue can then be configured to invoke an AWS Lambda function to perform the necessary processing on each order. This ensures that orders are processed in the exact order in which they are received.

Question 3
A company's containerized application runs on an Amazon EC2 instance. The application needs to download security certificates before it can communicate with other business applications. The company wants a highly secure solution to encrypt and decrypt the certificates in near real time. The solution also needs to store data in highly available storage after the data is encrypted.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?
A.
Create AWS Secrets Manager secrets for encrypted certificates. Manually update the certificates as needed. Control access to the data by using fine-grained IAM access.
B.
Create an AWS Lambda function that uses the Python cryptography library to receive and perform encryption operations. Store the function in an Amazon S3 bucket.
C.
Create an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer managed key. Allow the EC2 role to use the KMS key for encryption operations. Store the encrypted data on Amazon S3.
D.
Create an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer managed key. Allow the EC2 role to use the KMS key for encryption operations. Store the encrypted data on Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes.

Answer: C

Explanation:

Question 4
A solutions architect is designing a VPC with public and private subnets. The VPC and subnets use IPv4 CIDR blocks. There is one public subnet and one private subnet in each of three Availability Zones (AZs) for high availability. An internet gateway is used to provide internet access for the public subnets. The private subnets require access to the internet to allow Amazon EC2 instances to download software updates.
What should the solutions architect do to enable Internet access for the private subnets?
A.
Create three NAT gateways, one for each public subnet in each AZ. Create a private route table for each AZ that forwards non-VPC traffic to the NAT gateway in its AZ.
B.
Create three NAT instances, one for each private subnet in each AZ. Create a private route table for each AZ that forwards non-VPC traffic to the NAT instance in its AZ.
C.
Create a second internet gateway on one of the private subnets. Update the route table for the private subnets that forward non-VPC traffic to the private internet gateway.
D.
Create an egress-only internet gateway on one of the public subnets. Update the route table for the private subnets that forward non-VPC traffic to the egress-only Internet gateway.

Answer: A

Question 5
A company wants to migrate an on-premises data center to AWS. The data center hosts an SFTP server that stores its data on an NFS-based file system. The server holds 200 GB of data that needs to be transferred. The server must be hosted on an Amazon EC2 instance that uses an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file system.
Which combination of steps should a solutions architect take to automate this task? (Choose two.)
A.
Launch the EC2 instance into the same Availability Zone as the EFS file system.
B.
Install an AWS DataSync agent in the on-premises data center.
C.
Create a secondary Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume on the EC2 instance for the data.
D.
Manually use an operating system copy command to push the data to the EC2 instance.
E.
Use AWS DataSync to create a suitable location configuration for the on-premises SFTP server.

Answer: BE

Explanation:
To automate the process of transferring the data from the on-premises SFTP server to an EC2 instance with an EFS file system, you can use AWS DataSync. AWS DataSync is a fully managed data transfer service that simplifies, automates, and accelerates transferring data between on-premises storage systems and Amazon S3, Amazon EFS, or Amazon FSx for Windows File Server.  To use AWS DataSync for this task, you should first install an AWS DataSync agent in the on-premises data center. This agent is a lightweight software application that you install on your on-premises data source. The agent communicates with the AWS DataSync service to transfer data between the data source and target locations.

A. Launch the EC2 instance into the same Availability Zone as the EFS file system.  This option is not wrong, but it is not directly related to automating the process of transferring the data from the on-premises SFTP server to the EC2 instance with the EFS file system. Launching the EC2 instance into the same Availability Zone as the EFS file system can improve the performance and reliability of the file system, as it reduces the latency between the EC2 instance and the file system. However, it is not necessary for automating the data transfer process.

C. Create a secondary Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume on the EC2 instance for the data.  This option is incorrect because Amazon EBS is a block-level storage service that is designed for use with Amazon EC2 instances. It is not suitable for storing large amounts of data that need to be accessed by multiple EC2 instances, like in the case of the NFS-based file system on the on-premises SFTP server. Instead, you should use Amazon EFS, which is a fully managed, scalable, and distributed file system that can be accessed by multiple EC2 instances concurrently.

D. Manually use an operating system copy command to push the data to the EC2 instance.  This option is not wrong, but it is not the most efficient or automated way to transfer the data from the on-premises SFTP server to the EC2 instance with the EFS file system. Manually transferring the data using an operating system copy command would require manual intervention and would not scale well for large amounts of data. It would also not provide the same level of performance and reliability as a fully managed service like AWS DataSync.

Question 6
A company has an AWS Glue extract, transform, and load (ETL) job that runs every day at the same time. The job processes XML data that is in an Amazon S3 bucket. New data is added to the S3 bucket every day. A solutions architect notices that AWS Glue is processing all the data during each run.
What should the solutions architect do to prevent AWS Glue from reprocessing old data?
A.
Edit the job to use job bookmarks.
B.
Edit the job to delete data after the data is processed.
C.
Edit the job by setting the NumberOfWorkers field to 1.
D.
Use a FindMatches machine learning (ML) transform.

Answer: A

Explanation:
This is the purpose of bookmarks: "AWS Glue tracks data that has already been processed during a previous run of an ETL job by persisting state information from the job run. This persisted state information is called a job bookmark. Job bookmarks help AWS Glue maintain state information and prevent the reprocessing of old data."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/monitor-continuations.html

Question 7
A solutions architect must design a highly available infrastructure for a website. The website is powered by Windows web servers that run on Amazon EC2 instances. The solutions architect must implement a solution that can mitigate a large-scale DDoS attack that originates from thousands of IP addresses. Downtime is not acceptable for the website.
Which actions should the solutions architect take to protect the website from such an attack? (Choose two.)
A.
Use AWS Shield Advanced to stop the DDoS attack.
B.
Configure Amazon GuardDuty to automatically block the attackers.
C.
Configure the website to use Amazon CloudFront for both static and dynamic content.
D.
Use an AWS Lambda function to automatically add attacker IP addresses to VPC network ACLs.
E.
Use EC2 Spot Instances in an Auto Scaling group with a target tracking scaling policy that is set to 80% CPU utilization.

Answer: AC

Explanation:
Option A. Use AWS Shield Advanced to stop the DDoS attack.
It provides always-on protection for Amazon EC2 instances, Elastic Load Balancers, and Amazon Route 53 resources. By using AWS Shield Advanced, the solutions architect can help protect the website from large-scale DDoS attacks.
Option C. Configure the website to use Amazon CloudFront for both static and dynamic content.
CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) that integrates with other Amazon Web Services products, such as Amazon S3 and Amazon EC2, to deliver content to users with low latency and high data transfer speeds. By using CloudFront, the solutions architect can distribute the website's content across multiple edge locations, which can help absorb the impact of a DDoS attack and reduce the risk of downtime for the website.

"AWS Shield Advanced is available globally on all Amazon CloudFront, AWS Global Accelerator, and Amazon Route 53 edge locations worldwide. You can protect your web applications hosted anywhere in the world by deploying Amazon CloudFront in front of your application. Your origin servers can be Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3), Amazon EC2, Elastic Load Balancing, or a custom server outside of AWS."

Question 8
A company is preparing to deploy a new serverless workload. A solutions architect must use the principle of least privilege to configure permissions that will be used to run an AWS Lambda function. An Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule will invoke the function.
Which solution meets these requirements?
A.
Add an execution role to the function with lambda:InvokeFunction as the action and * as the principal.
B.
Add an execution role to the function with lambda:InvokeFunction as the action and Service: lambda.amazonaws.com as the principal.
C.
Add a resource-based policy to the function with lambda:* as the action and Service: events.amazonaws.com as the principal.
D.
Add a resource-based policy to the function with lambda:InvokeFunction as the action and Service: events.amazonaws.com as the principal.

Answer: D

Explanation:
The question is taken from the example shown here in the documentation:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-use-resource-based.html#eb-lambda-permissions

Add a resource-based policy to the function with lambda:InvokeFunction as the action and Service: events.amazonaws.com as the principal.
The principle of least privilege requires that permissions are granted only to the minimum necessary to perform a task. In this case, the Lambda function needs to be able to be invoked by Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events). To meet these requirements, you can add a resource-based policy to the function that allows the InvokeFunction action to be performed by the Service: events.amazonaws.com principal. This will allow Amazon EventBridge to invoke the function, but will not grant any additional permissions to the function.

Question 9
A company is preparing to store confidential data in Amazon S3. For compliance reasons, the data must be encrypted at rest. Encryption key usage must be logged for auditing purposes. Keys must be rotated every year.
Which solution meets these requirements and is the MOST operationally efficient?
A.
Server-side encryption with customer-provided keys (SSE-C)
B.
Server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3)
C.
Server-side encryption with AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS) with manual rotation
D.
Server-side encryption with AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS) with automatic rotation

Answer: D

Explanation:
Automating the key rotation is the most efficient.
Just to confirm, the A and B options don't allow automate the rotation as explained here: https://aws.amazon.com/kms/faqs/#:~:text=You%20can%20choose%20to%20have%20AWS%20KMS%20automatically%20rotate%20KMS,KMS%20custom%20key%20store%20feature

SSE-KMS provides a secure and efficient way to encrypt data at rest in S3. SSE-KMS uses KMS to manage the encryption keys securely. With SSE-KMS, encryption keys can be automatically rotated using KMS key rotation feature, which simplifies the key management process and ensures compliance with the requirement to rotate keys every year.
Additionally, SSE-KMS provides built-in audit logging for encryption key usage through CloudTrail, which captures API calls related to the management and usage of KMS keys. This meets the requirement for logging key usage for auditing purposes.
Option A (SSE-C) requires customers to provide their own encryption keys, but it does not provide key rotation or built-in logging of key usage.
Option B (SSE-S3) uses Amazon S3 managed keys for encryption, which simplifies key management but does not provide key rotation or detailed key usage logging.
Option C (SSE-KMS with manual rotation) uses AWS KMS keys but requires manual rotation, which is less operationally efficient than the automatic key rotation available with option D.

Question 10
A bicycle sharing company is developing a multi-tier architecture to track the location of its bicycles during peak operating hours. The company wants to use these data points in its existing analytics platform. A solutions architect must determine the most viable multi-tier option to support this architecture. The data points must be accessible from the REST API.
Which action meets these requirements for storing and retrieving location data?
A.
Use Amazon Athena with Amazon S3.
B.
Use Amazon API Gateway with AWS Lambda.
C.
Use Amazon QuickSight with Amazon Redshift.
D.
Use Amazon API Gateway with Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics.
[-]

Answer: B?D?

Explanation:
This AWS CloudFormation template deploys a reference architecture that includes the following:
An Amazon API Gateway REST API acts as a proxy to Amazon Kinesis Data Streams, adding either an individual data record or a list of data records.
An Amazon Cognito user pool is used to control who can invoke REST API methods.
Kinesis Data Streams to store the incoming streaming data.
An AWS Lambda function processes the records from the data stream.

Question 11
A company has an automobile sales website that stores its listings in a database on Amazon RDS. When an automobile is sold, the listing needs to be removed from the website and the data must be sent to multiple target systems.
Which design should a solutions architect recommend?
A.
Create an AWS Lambda function triggered when the database on Amazon RDS is updated to send the information to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue for the targets to consume.
B.
Create an AWS Lambda function triggered when the database on Amazon RDS is updated to send the information to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) FIFO queue for the targets to consume.
C.
Subscribe to an RDS event notification and send an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue fanned out to multiple Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topics. Use AWS Lambda functions to update the targets.
D.
Subscribe to an RDS event notification and send an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic fanned out to multiple Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queues. Use AWS Lambda functions to update the targets.

Answer: A? D?

Explanation:
D could have been a perfect solution but RDS does not create event notifications based on database updates .. You can refer to the link below to the kind of events RDS triggers notifications for
=> https://dzone.com/articles/how-can-i-know-what-happens-inside-amazon-rds#:~:text=an%20event%20subscription.-,AWS%20RDS%20Event%20Categories%20and%20Messages,-Amazon%20RDS%20generates
A is a good alternative that lacks fanning out which will not be necessary if the visibility timeout is adjusted properly and the targets are not many.
A is the near best alternative so I GO in for A.

Question 12
A company needs to store data in Amazon S3 and must prevent the data from being changed. The company wants new objects that are uploaded to Amazon S3 to remain unchangeable for a nonspecific amount of time until the company decides to modify the objects. Only specific users in the company's AWS account can have the ability 10 delete the objects.
What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements?
A.
Create an S3 Glacier vault. Apply a write-once, read-many (WORM) vault lock policy to the objects.
B.
Create an S3 bucket with S3 Object Lock enabled. Enable versioning. Set a retention period of 100 years. Use governance mode as the S3 bucket’s default retention mode for new objects.
C.
Create an S3 bucket. Use AWS CloudTrail to track any S3 API events that modify the objects. Upon notification, restore the modified objects from any backup versions that the company has.
D.
Create an S3 bucket with S3 Object Lock enabled. Enable versioning. Add a legal hold to the objects. Add the s3:PutObjectLegalHold permission to the IAM policies of users who need to delete the objects.

Answer: D

Explanation:
A - No as "specific users can delete"
B - No as "nonspecific amount of time"
C - No as "prevent the data from being change"
D - The answer: "The Object Lock legal hold operation enables you to place a legal hold on an object version. Like setting a retention period, a legal hold prevents an object version from being overwritten or deleted. However, a legal hold doesn't have an associated retention period and remains in effect until removed." https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/batch-ops-legal-hold.html

Question 13
A company has an application that runs on Amazon EC2 instances and uses an Amazon Aurora database. The EC2 instances connect to the database by using user names and passwords that are stored locally in a file. The company wants to minimize the operational overhead of credential management.
What should a solutions architect do to accomplish this goal?
A.
Use AWS Secrets Manager. Turn on automatic rotation.
B.
Use AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store. Turn on automatic rotation.
C.
Create an Amazon S3 bucket to store objects that are encrypted with an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) encryption key. Migrate the credential file to the S3 bucket. Point the application to the S3 bucket.
D.
Create an encrypted Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume for each EC2 instance. Attach the new EBS volume to each EC2 instance. Migrate the credential file to the new EBS volume. Point the application to the new EBS volume.

Answer: A

Explanation:
AWS Secrets Manager is a service that provides a secure and convenient way to store, manage, and rotate secrets. Secrets Manager can be used to store database credentials, SSH keys, and other sensitive information.
AWS Secrets Manager also supports automatic rotation, which can help to minimize the operational overhead of credential management. When automatic rotation is enabled, Secrets Manager will automatically generate new secrets and rotate them on a regular schedule

Question 14
A social media company allows users to upload images to its website. The website runs on Amazon EC2 instances. During upload requests, the website resizes the images to a standard size and stores the resized images in Amazon S3. Users are experiencing slow upload requests to the website.
The company needs to reduce coupling within the application and improve website performance. A solutions architect must design the most operationally efficient process for image uploads.
Which combination of actions should the solutions architect take to meet these requirements? (Choose two.)
A.
Configure the application to upload images to S3 Glacier.
B.
Configure the web server to upload the original images to Amazon S3.
C.
Configure the application to upload images directly from each user's browser to Amazon S3 through the use of a presigned URL
D.
Configure S3 Event Notifications to invoke an AWS Lambda function when an image is uploaded. Use the function to resize the image.
E.
Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that invokes an AWS Lambda function on a schedule to resize uploaded images.

Answer: BD

Explanation:
A presigned URL remains valid for the period of time specified when the URL is generated. If you create a presigned URL with the Amazon S3 console, the expiration time can be set between 1 minute and 12 hours. If you use the AWS CLI or AWS SDKs, the expiration time can be set as high as 7 days.

Why would anyone vote C? signed URL is for temporary access. also, look at the vote here: https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/amazon/view/82971-exam-aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c02/

Question 15
A company recently migrated a message processing system to AWS. The system receives messages into an ActiveMQ queue running on an Amazon EC2 instance. Messages are processed by a consumer application running on Amazon EC2. The consumer application processes the messages and writes results to a MySQL database running on Amazon EC2. The company wants this application to be highly available with low operational complexity.
Which architecture offers the HIGHEST availability?
A.
Add a second ActiveMQ server to another Availability Zone. Add an additional consumer EC2 instance in another Availability Zone. Replicate the MySQL database to another Availability Zone.
B.
Use Amazon MQ with active/standby brokers configured across two Availability Zones. Add an additional consumer EC2 instance in another Availability Zone. Replicate the MySQL database to another Availability Zone.
C.
Use Amazon MQ with active/standby brokers configured across two Availability Zones. Add an additional consumer EC2 instance in another Availability Zone. Use Amazon RDS for MySQL with Multi-AZ enabled.
D.
Use Amazon MQ with active/standby brokers configured across two Availability Zones. Add an Auto Scaling group for the consumer EC2 instances across two Availability Zones. Use Amazon RDS for MySQL with Multi-AZ enabled.

Answer: D

Explanation:
The key reasons are:
Amazon MQ active/standby brokers across AZs for queue high availability
Auto Scaling group with consumer EC2 instances across AZs for redundant processing
RDS MySQL with Multi-AZ for database high availability
This combines the HA capabilities of MQ, EC2 and RDS to maximize fault tolerance across all components. The auto scaling also provides flexibility to scale processing capacity as needed.

Question 16
A company hosts a containerized web application on a fleet of on-premises servers that process incoming requests. The number of requests is growing quickly. The on-premises servers cannot handle the increased number of requests. The company wants to move the application to AWS with minimum code changes and minimum development effort.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?
A.
Use AWS Fargate on Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) to run the containerized web application with Service Auto Scaling. Use an Application Load Balancer to distribute the incoming requests.
B.
Use two Amazon EC2 instances to host the containerized web application. Use an Application Load Balancer to distribute the incoming requests.
C.
Use AWS Lambda with a new code that uses one of the supported languages. Create multiple Lambda functions to support the load. Use Amazon API Gateway as an entry point to the Lambda functions.
D.
Use a high performance computing (HPC) solution such as AWS ParallelCluster to establish an HPC cluster that can process the incoming requests at the appropriate scale.

Answer: A

Explanation:
A is the best solution to meet the requirements with the least operational overhead. The key reasons are:
AWS Fargate removes the need to provision and manage servers. Fargate will automatically scale the application based on demand. This removes a significant operational burden.
Using ECS along with Fargate provides a managed orchestration layer to easily run and scale the containerized application.
The Application Load Balancer handles distribution of traffic without additional effort.
No code changes are required to move the application to Fargate. The containers can run as-is.

Option A (AWS Fargate on Amazon ECS with Service Auto Scaling) is the best choice as it provides a serverless and managed environment for your containerized web application. It requires minimal code changes, offers automatic scaling, and utilizes an Application Load Balancer for request distribution.
Option B (Amazon EC2 instances with an Application Load Balancer) requires manual management of EC2 instances, resulting in more operational overhead compared to option A.
Option C (AWS Lambda with API Gateway) may require significant code changes and restructuring, introducing complexity and potentially increasing development effort.
Option D (AWS ParallelCluster) is not suitable for a containerized web application and involves significant setup and configuration overhead.

Question 17
A company uses 50 TB of data for reporting. The company wants to move this data from on premises to AWS. A custom application in the company’s data center runs a weekly data transformation job. The company plans to pause the application until the data transfer is complete and needs to begin the transfer process as soon as possible.
The data center does not have any available network bandwidth for additional workloads. A solutions architect must transfer the data and must configure the transformation job to continue to run in the AWS Cloud.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?
A.
Use AWS DataSync to move the data. Create a custom transformation job by using AWS Glue.
B.
Order an AWS Snowcone device to move the data. Deploy the transformation application to the device.
C.
Order an AWS Snowball Edge Storage Optimized device. Copy the data to the device. Create a custom transformation job by using AWS Glue.
D.
Order an AWS Snowball Edge Storage Optimized device that includes Amazon EC2 compute. Copy the data to the device. Create a new EC2 instance on AWS to run the transformation application.

Answer: C

Explanation:
A. Use AWS DataSync to move the data. Create a custom transformation job by using AWS Glue. - No BW available for DataSync, so "asap" will be weeks/months (?)
B. Order an AWS Snowcone device to move the data. Deploy the transformation application to the device. - Snowcone will just store 14TB (SSD configuration).
**C**. Order an AWS Snowball Edge Storage Optimized device. Copy the data to the device. Create a custom transformation job by using AWS Glue. - SnowBall can store 80TB (ok), takes around 1 week to move the device (faster than A), and AWS Glue allows to do ETL jobs. This is the answer.
D. Order an AWS Snowball Edge Storage Optimized device that includes Amazon EC2 compute. Copy the data to the device. Create a new EC2 instance on AWS to run the transformation application. - Same as C, but the ETL job requires the deployment/configuration/maintenance of an EC2 instance, while Glue is serverless. This means D has more operational overhead than C.

Question 18
A company has created an image analysis application in which users can upload photos and add photo frames to their images. The users upload images and metadata to indicate which photo frames they want to add to their images. The application uses a single Amazon EC2 instance and Amazon DynamoDB to store the metadata.
The application is becoming more popular, and the number of users is increasing. The company expects the number of concurrent users to vary significantly depending on the time of day and day of week. The company must ensure that the application can scale to meet the needs of the growing user base.
Which solution meats these requirements?
A.
Use AWS Lambda to process the photos. Store the photos and metadata in DynamoDB.
B.
Use Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose to process the photos and to store the photos and metadata.
C.
Use AWS Lambda to process the photos. Store the photos in Amazon S3. Retain DynamoDB to store the metadata.
D.
Increase the number of EC2 instances to three. Use Provisioned IOPS SSD (io2) Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes to store the photos and metadata.

Answer: C

Explanation:
Solution C offloads the photo processing to Lambda. Storing the photos in S3 ensures scalability and durability, while keeping the metadata in DynamoDB allows for efficient querying of the associated information.
Option A does not provide an appropriate solution for storing the photos, as DynamoDB is not suitable for storing large binary data like images.
Option B is more focused on real-time streaming data processing and is not the ideal service for processing and storing photos and metadata in this use case.
Option D involves manual scaling and management of EC2 instances, which is less flexible and more labor-intensive compared to the serverless nature of Lambda. It may not efficiently handle the varying number of concurrent users and can introduce higher operational overhead.
In conclusion, option C provides the best solution for scaling the application to meet the needs of the growing user base by leveraging the scalability and durability of Lambda, S3, and DynamoDB.

Question 19
A medical records company is hosting an application on Amazon EC2 instances. The application processes customer data files that are stored on Amazon S3. The EC2 instances are hosted in public subnets. The EC2 instances access Amazon S3 over the internet, but they do not require any other network access.
A new requirement mandates that the network traffic for file transfers take a private route and not be sent over the internet.
Which change to the network architecture should a solutions architect recommend to meet this requirement?
A.
Create a NAT gateway. Configure the route table for the public subnets to send traffic to Amazon S3 through the NAT gateway.
B.
Configure the security group for the EC2 instances to restrict outbound traffic so that only traffic to the S3 prefix list is permitted.
C.
Move the EC2 instances to private subnets. Create a VPC endpoint for Amazon S3, and link the endpoint to the route table for the private subnets.
D.
Remove the internet gateway from the VPC. Set up an AWS Direct Connect connection, and route traffic to Amazon S3 over the Direct Connect connection.

Answer: C

Explanation:
Option A (creating a NAT gateway) would not meet the requirement since it still involves sending traffic to S3 over the internet. NAT gateway is used for outbound internet connectivity from private subnets, but it doesn't provide a private route for accessing S3.
Option B (configuring security groups) focuses on controlling outbound traffic using security groups. While it can restrict outbound traffic, it doesn't provide a private route for accessing S3.
Option D (setting up Direct Connect) involves establishing a dedicated private network connection between the on-premises environment and AWS. While it offers private connectivity, it is more suitable for hybrid scenarios and not necessary for achieving private access to S3 within the VPC.
In summary, option C provides a straightforward solution by moving the EC2 instances to private subnets, creating a VPC endpoint for S3, and linking the endpoint to the route table for private subnets. This ensures that file transfer traffic between the EC2 instances and S3 remains within the private network without going over the internet.

Question 20
A company uses a popular content management system (CMS) for its corporate website. However, the required patching and maintenance are burdensome. The company is redesigning its website and wants anew solution. The website will be updated four times a year and does not need to have any dynamic content available. The solution must provide high scalability and enhanced security.
Which combination of changes will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead? (Choose two.)
A.
Configure Amazon CloudFront in front of the website to use HTTPS functionality.
B.
Deploy an AWS WAF web ACL in front of the website to provide HTTPS functionality.
C.
Create and deploy an AWS Lambda function to manage and serve the website content.
D.
Create the new website and an Amazon S3 bucket. Deploy the website on the S3 bucket with static website hosting enabled.
E.
Create the new website. Deploy the website by using an Auto Scaling group of Amazon EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer.

Answer: AD

Explanation:
static website -> obviously S3, and S3 is super scalable
CDN -> CloudFront obviously as well, and with HTTPS security is enhanced.
B does not make sense because you are not replacing the CDN with anything,
E works too but takes too much effort and compared to S3, S3 still wins in term of scalability. plus why use EC2 when you are only hosting static website

A -> We can configure CloudFront to require HTTPS from clients (enhanced security) https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-https-viewers-to-cloudfront.html
D -> storing static website on S3 provides scalability and less operational overhead, then configuration of Application LB and EC2 instances (hence E is out)
B is out since AWS WAF Web ACL does not to provide HTTPS functionality, but to protect HTTPS only.

Question 21
A company stores its application logs in an Amazon CloudWatch Logs log group. A new policy requires the company to store all application logs in Amazon OpenSearch Service (Amazon Elasticsearch Service) in near-real time.
Which solution will meet this requirement with the LEAST operational overhead?
A.
Configure a CloudWatch Logs subscription to stream the logs to Amazon OpenSearch Service (Amazon Elasticsearch Service).
B.
Create an AWS Lambda function. Use the log group to invoke the function to write the logs to Amazon OpenSearch Service (Amazon Elasticsearch Service).
C.
Create an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream. Configure the log group as the delivery streams sources. Configure Amazon OpenSearch Service (Amazon Elasticsearch Service) as the delivery stream's destination.
D.
Install and configure Amazon Kinesis Agent on each application server to deliver the logs to Amazon Kinesis Data Streams. Configure Kinesis Data Streams to deliver the logs to Amazon OpenSearch Service (Amazon Elasticsearch Service).

Answer: A

Explanation:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/CWL_OpenSearch_Stream.html
> You can configure a CloudWatch Logs log group to stream data it receives to your Amazon OpenSearch Service cluster in NEAR REAL-TIME through a CloudWatch Logs subscription
least overhead compared to kinesis

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/integrations.html
You can use CloudWatch or Kinesis, but in the Kinesis description it never says real time, however in the Cloudwatch description it does say Real time ""You can load streaming data from CloudWatch Logs to your OpenSearch Service domain by using a CloudWatch Logs subscription . For information about Amazon CloudWatch subscriptions, see Real-time processing of log data with subscriptions.""

Question 22
A company is building a web-based application running on Amazon EC2 instances in multiple Availability Zones. The web application will provide access to a repository of text documents totaling about 900 TB in size. The company anticipates that the web application will experience periods of high demand. A solutions architect must ensure that the storage component for the text documents can scale to meet the demand of the application at all times. The company is concerned about the overall cost of the solution.
Which storage solution meets these requirements MOST cost-effectively?
A.
Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS)
B.
Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS)
C.
Amazon OpenSearch Service (Amazon Elasticsearch Service)
D.
Amazon S3

Answer: D

Explanation:
Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is a highly scalable and cost-effective storage service. It is well-suited for storing large amounts of data, such as the 900 TB of text documents mentioned in the scenario. S3 provides high durability, availability, and performance.
Option A (Amazon EBS) is block storage designed for individual EC2 instances and may not scale as seamlessly and cost-effectively as S3 for large amounts of data.
Option B (Amazon EFS) is a scalable file storage service, but it may not be the most cost-effective option compared to S3, especially for the anticipated storage size of 900 TB.
Option C (Amazon OpenSearch Service) is a search and analytics service and may not be suitable as the primary storage solution for the text documents.
In summary, Amazon S3 is the recommended choice as it offers high scalability, cost-effectiveness, and durability for storing the large repository of text documents required by the web application.

Question 23

A solutions architect must design a solution to protect these API Gateway managed REST APIs across multiple accounts from SQL injection and cross-site scripting attacks.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST amount of administrative effort?
A.
Set up AWS WAF in both Regions. Associate Regional web ACLs with an API stage.
B.
Set up AWS Firewall Manager in both Regions. Centrally configure AWS WAF rules.
C.
Set up AWS Shield in bath Regions. Associate Regional web ACLs with an API stage.
D.
Set up AWS Shield in one of the Regions. Associate Regional web ACLs with an API stage.

Answer: B

Explanation:
Using AWS WAF has several benefits. Additional protection against web attacks using criteria that you specify. You can define criteria using characteristics of web requests such as the following:
Presence of SQL code that is likely to be malicious (known as SQL injection).
Presence of a script that is likely to be malicious (known as cross-site scripting).
AWS Firewall Manager simplifies your administration and maintenance tasks across multiple accounts and resources for a variety of protections.

Question 24
A global company hosts its web application on Amazon EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB). The web application has static data and dynamic data. The company stores its static data in an Amazon S3 bucket. The company wants to improve performance and reduce latency for the static data and dynamic data. The company is using its own domain name registered with Amazon Route 53.
What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements?
A.
Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution that has the S3 bucket and the ALB as origins. Configure Route 53 to route traffic to the CloudFront distribution.
B.
Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution that has the ALB as an origin. Create an AWS Global Accelerator standard accelerator that has the S3 bucket as an endpoint Configure Route 53 to route traffic to the CloudFront distribution.
C.
Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution that has the S3 bucket as an origin. Create an AWS Global Accelerator standard accelerator that has the ALB and the CloudFront distribution as endpoints. Create a custom domain name that points to the accelerator DNS name. Use the custom domain name as an endpoint for the web application.
D.
Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution that has the ALB as an origin. Create an AWS Global Accelerator standard accelerator that has the S3 bucket as an endpoint. Create two domain names. Point one domain name to the CloudFront DNS name for dynamic content. Point the other domain name to the accelerator DNS name for static content. Use the domain names as endpoints for the web application.

Answer: A

Explanation:
Explanation - AWS Global Accelerator vs CloudFront
• They both use the AWS global network and its edge locations around the world
• Both services integrate with AWS Shield for DDoS protection.
• CloudFront
• Improves performance for both cacheable content (such as images and videos)
• Dynamic content (such as API acceleration and dynamic site delivery)
• Content is served at the edge
• Global Accelerator
• Improves performance for a wide range of applications over TCP or UDP
• Proxying packets at the edge to applications running in one or more AWS Regions.
• Good fit for non-HTTP use cases, such as gaming (UDP), IoT (MQTT), or Voice over IP
• Good for HTTP use cases that require static IP addresses
• Good for HTTP use cases that required deterministic, fast regional failover

AWS Global Accelerator and Amazon CloudFront are separate services that use the AWS global network and its edge locations around the world. CloudFront improves performance for both cacheable content (such as images and videos) and dynamic content (such as API acceleration and dynamic site delivery). Global Accelerator improves performance for a wide range of applications over TCP or UDP by proxying packets at the edge to applications running in one or more AWS Regions. Global Accelerator is a good fit for non-HTTP use cases, such as gaming (UDP), IoT (MQTT), or Voice over IP, as well as for HTTP use cases that specifically require static IP addresses or deterministic, fast regional failover. Both services integrate with AWS Shield for DDoS protection.

Question 25
A company has implemented a self-managed DNS solution on three Amazon EC2 instances behind a Network Load Balancer (NLB) in the us-west-2 Region. Most of the company's users are located in the United States and Europe. The company wants to improve the performance and availability of the solution. The company launches and configures three EC2 instances in the eu-west-1 Region and adds the EC2 instances as targets for a new NLB.
Which solution can the company use to route traffic to all the EC2 instances?
A.
Create an Amazon Route 53 geolocation routing policy to route requests to one of the two NLBs. Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution. Use the Route 53 record as the distribution’s origin.
B.
Create a standard accelerator in AWS Global Accelerator. Create endpoint groups in us-west-2 and eu-west-1. Add the two NLBs as endpoints for the endpoint groups.
C.
Attach Elastic IP addresses to the six EC2 instances. Create an Amazon Route 53 geolocation routing policy to route requests to one of the six EC2 instances. Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution. Use the Route 53 record as the distribution's origin.
D.
Replace the two NLBs with two Application Load Balancers (ALBs). Create an Amazon Route 53 latency routing policy to route requests to one of the two ALBs. Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution. Use the Route 53 record as the distribution’s origin.

Answer: B

Explanation:
Not A: CloudFront is not for DNS
Not C: Involves CloudFront which is not needed, otherwise would work but ignore the NLBs
Not D: ALB can't handle DNS

Option B. Create a standard accelerator in AWS Global Accelerator. Establish endpoint groups in us-west-2 and eu-west-1. Add two NLBs as endpoints of the endpoint group.
AWS Global Accelerator is a network service that can provide a global traffic management solution. By creating a standard accelerator in AWS Global Accelerator, you can guide user traffic to the endpoint closest to them, thereby improving the performance and availability of the application. In this case, you can establish endpoint groups in the us-west-2 and eu-west-1 regions, and add two NLBs as endpoints. In this way, no matter where the user is located, their requests will be routed to the EC2 instance closest to them, thereby improving the performance and availability of DNS resolution. In addition, this design can also provide flexibility and scalability to handle a large amount of traffic. Therefore, this solution can meet your needs.

Question 26
A company is running an online transaction processing (OLTP) workload on AWS. This workload uses an unencrypted Amazon RDS DB instance in a Multi-AZ deployment. Daily database snapshots are taken from this instance.
What should a solutions architect do to ensure the database and snapshots are always encrypted moving forward?
A.
Encrypt a copy of the latest DB snapshot. Replace existing DB instance by restoring the encrypted snapshot.
B.
Create a new encrypted Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume and copy the snapshots to it. Enable encryption on the DB instance.
C.
Copy the snapshots and enable encryption using AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) Restore encrypted snapshot to an existing DB instance.
D.
Copy the snapshots to an Amazon S3 bucket that is encrypted using server-side encryption with AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) managed keys (SSE-KMS).

Answer: A

Explanation:
"You can enable encryption for an Amazon RDS DB instance when you create it, but not after it's created. However, you can add encryption to an unencrypted DB instance by creating a snapshot of your DB instance, and then creating an encrypted copy of that snapshot. You can then restore a DB instance from the encrypted snapshot to get an encrypted copy of your original DB instance."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/patterns/encrypt-an-existing-amazon-rds-for-postgresql-db-instance.html

Question 27
A company wants to build a scalable key management infrastructure to support developers who need to encrypt data in their applications.
What should a solutions architect do to reduce the operational burden?
A.
Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) to protect the encryption keys.
B.
Use AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) to protect the encryption keys.
C.
Use AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) to create, store, and assign the encryption keys.
D.
Use an IAM policy to limit the scope of users who have access permissions to protect the encryption keys.

Answer: B

Explanation:
The correct answer is Option B. To reduce the operational burden, the solutions architect should use AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) to protect the encryption keys.
AWS KMS is a fully managed service that makes it easy to create and manage encryption keys. It allows developers to easily encrypt and decrypt data in their applications, and it automatically handles the underlying key management tasks, such as key generation, key rotation, and key deletion. This can help to reduce the operational burden associated with key management.

By utilizing AWS KMS, the company can offload the operational responsibilities of key management, including key generation, rotation, and protection. AWS KMS provides a scalable and secure infrastructure for managing encryption keys, allowing developers to easily integrate encryption into their applications without the need to manage the underlying key infrastructure.
Option A (MFA), option C (ACM), and option D (IAM policy) are not directly related to reducing the operational burden of key management. While these options may provide additional security measures or access controls, they do not specifically address the scalability and management aspects of a key management infrastructure. AWS KMS is designed to simplify the key management process and is the most suitable option for reducing the operational burden in this scenario.

Question 28
A company has a dynamic web application hosted on two Amazon EC2 instances. The company has its own SSL certificate, which is on each instance to perform SSL termination.
There has been an increase in traffic recently, and the operations team determined that SSL encryption and decryption is causing the compute capacity of the web servers to reach their maximum limit.
What should a solutions architect do to increase the application's performance?
A.
Create a new SSL certificate using AWS Certificate Manager (ACM). Install the ACM certificate on each instance.
B.
Create an Amazon S3 bucket Migrate the SSL certificate to the S3 bucket. Configure the EC2 instances to reference the bucket for SSL termination.
C.
Create another EC2 instance as a proxy server. Migrate the SSL certificate to the new instance and configure it to direct connections to the existing EC2 instances.
D.
Import the SSL certificate into AWS Certificate Manager (ACM). Create an Application Load Balancer with an HTTPS listener that uses the SSL certificate from ACM.

Answer: D

Explanation:

The correct answer is D. To increase the application's performance, the solutions architect should import the SSL certificate into AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) and create an Application Load Balancer with an HTTPS listener that uses the SSL certificate from ACM.
An Application Load Balancer (ALB) can offload the SSL termination process from the EC2 instances, which can help to increase the compute capacity available for the web application. By creating an ALB with an HTTPS listener and using the SSL certificate from ACM, the ALB can handle the SSL termination process, leaving the EC2 instances free to focus on running the web application.

This issue is solved by SSL offloading, i.e. by moving the SSL termination task to the ALB.
https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/elastic-load-balancer-support-for-ssl-termination/

Question 29
A company has a highly dynamic batch processing job that uses many Amazon EC2 instances to complete it. The job is stateless in nature, can be started and stopped at any given time with no negative impact, and typically takes upwards of 60 minutes total to complete. The company has asked a solutions architect to design a scalable and cost-effective solution that meets the requirements of the job.
What should the solutions architect recommend?
A.
Implement EC2 Spot Instances.
B.
Purchase EC2 Reserved Instances.
C.
Implement EC2 On-Demand Instances.
D.
Implement the processing on AWS Lambda.
[-]

Answer: A

Explanation:
The key reasons are:
Spot can provide significant cost savings (up to 90%) compared to On-Demand.
Since the job is stateless and can be stopped/restarted anytime, the intermittent availability of Spot is not an issue.
Spot supports the same instance types as On-Demand, so optimal instance types can be chosen.
For a 60+ minute batch job, the chance of Spot interruption is low. But if it happens, the job can just be restarted.
Reserved Instances don't offer any advantage for a highly dynamic job like this.
Lambda is not a good fit given the long runtime requirement.

Question 30
A company runs its two-tier ecommerce website on AWS. The web tier consists of a load balancer that sends traffic to Amazon EC2 instances. The database tier uses an Amazon RDS DB instance. The EC2 instances and the RDS DB instance should not be exposed to the public internet. The EC2 instances require internet access to complete payment processing of orders through a third-party web service. The application must be highly available.
Which combination of configuration options will meet these requirements? (Choose two.)
A.
Use an Auto Scaling group to launch the EC2 instances in private subnets. Deploy an RDS Multi-AZ DB instance in private subnets.
B.
Configure a VPC with two private subnets and two NAT gateways across two Availability Zones. Deploy an Application Load Balancer in the private subnets.
C.
Use an Auto Scaling group to launch the EC2 instances in public subnets across two Availability Zones. Deploy an RDS Multi-AZ DB instance in private subnets.
D.
Configure a VPC with one public subnet, one private subnet, and two NAT gateways across two Availability Zones. Deploy an Application Load Balancer in the public subnet. D. Configure a VPC with two public subnets, two private subnets, and two NAT gateways across two Availability Zones. Deploy an Application Load Balancer in the public subnets.

Answer: AD? AE?

Explanation:
Application has to be highly available while the instance and database should not be exposed to the public internet, but the instances still requires access to the internet. NAT gateway has to be deployed in public subnets in this case while instances and database remain in private subnets in the VPC, therefore answer is (A) and (E).
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat-gateway.html
If the instances did not require access to the internet, then the answer could have been
(B) to use a private NAT gateway and keep it in the private subnets to communicate only to the VPCs.
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Scenario2.html

Answer A for: The EC2 instances and the RDS DB instance should not be exposed to the public internet. Answer D for: The EC2 instances require internet access to complete payment processing of orders through a third-party web service. Answer A for: The application must be highly available.

Question 31
A solutions architect needs to implement a solution to reduce a company's storage costs. All the company's data is in the Amazon S3 Standard storage class. The company must keep all data for at least 25 years. Data from the most recent 2 years must be highly available and immediately retrievable.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Set up an S3 Lifecycle policy to transition objects to S3 Glacier Deep Archive immediately.
B.
Set up an S3 Lifecycle policy to transition objects to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 2 years.
C.
Use S3 Intelligent-Tiering. Activate the archiving option to ensure that data is archived in S3 Glacier Deep Archive.
D.
Set up an S3 Lifecycle policy to transition objects to S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA) immediately and to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 2 years.

Answer: B

Explanation:
Why Not C? Because Intelligent Tier the objects are automatically moved to different tiers.
The question says "the data from most recent 2 yrs should be highly available and immediately retrievable", which means in intelligent tier , if you activate archiving option(as Option C specifies) , the objects will be moved to Archive tiers(instant to access to deep archive access tiers) in 90 to 730 days. Remember these archive tiers performance will be similar to S3 glacier flexible and s3 deep archive which means files cannot be retrieved immediately within 2 yrs .
We have a hard requirement in question which says it should be retreivable immediately for the 2 yrs. which cannot be acheived in Intelligent tier. So B is the correct option imho.
Because of the above reason Its possible only in S3 standard and then configure lifecycle configuration to move to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 2 yrs.

Question 32
A media company is evaluating the possibility of moving its systems to the AWS Cloud. The company needs at least 10 TB of storage with the maximum possible I/O performance for video processing, 300 TB of very durable storage for storing media content, and 900 TB of storage to meet requirements for archival media that is not in use anymore.
Which set of services should a solutions architect recommend to meet these requirements?
A.
Amazon EBS for maximum performance, Amazon S3 for durable data storage, and Amazon S3 Glacier for archival storage
B.
Amazon EBS for maximum performance, Amazon EFS for durable data storage, and Amazon S3 Glacier for archival storage
C.
Amazon EC2 instance store for maximum performance, Amazon EFS for durable data storage, and Amazon S3 for archival storage
D.
Amazon EC2 instance store for maximum performance, Amazon S3 for durable data storage, and Amazon S3 Glacier for archival storage

Answer: D

Explanation:
Max instance store possible at this time is 30TB for NVMe which has the higher I/O compared to EBS.

Question 33
A company wants to run applications in containers in the AWS Cloud. These applications are stateless and can tolerate disruptions within the underlying infrastructure. The company needs a solution that minimizes cost and operational overhead.
What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements?
A.
Use Spot Instances in an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group to run the application containers.
B.
Use Spot Instances in an Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) managed node group.
C.
Use On-Demand Instances in an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group to run the application containers.
D.
Use On-Demand Instances in an Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) managed node group.

Answer: B

Explanation:
Breaking down the reasons for it:
1 - Spot is much cheaper than on-demand, which already eliminates C&D for cost related.
2 - Even though we can create a bootstrap script to install docker, managing this can be complicated, especially if any of the applications require more than one instance running.

Question 34
A company is running a multi-tier web application on premises. The web application is containerized and runs on a number of Linux hosts connected to a PostgreSQL database that contains user records. The operational overhead of maintaining the infrastructure and capacity planning is limiting the company's growth. A solutions architect must improve the application's infrastructure.
Which combination of actions should the solutions architect take to accomplish this? (Choose two.)
A.
Migrate the PostgreSQL database to Amazon Aurora.
B.
Migrate the web application to be hosted on Amazon EC2 instances.
C.
Set up an Amazon CloudFront distribution for the web application content.
D.
Set up Amazon ElastiCache between the web application and the PostgreSQL database.
E.
Migrate the web application to be hosted on AWS Fargate with Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS).

Answer: AE

Explanation:
Requirement is to reduce operational overhead,
Amazon Aurora provides built-in security, continuous backups, serverless compute, up to 15 read replicas, automated multi-Region replication.
AWS Fargate is a serverless, pay-as-you-go compute engine that lets you focus on building applications without managing servers.

Question 35
A company performs monthly maintenance on its AWS infrastructure. During these maintenance activities, the company needs to rotate the credentials for its Amazon RDS for MySQL databases across multiple AWS Regions.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?
A.
Store the credentials as secrets in AWS Secrets Manager. Use multi-Region secret replication for the required Regions. Configure Secrets Manager to rotate the secrets on a schedule.
B.
Store the credentials as secrets in AWS Systems Manager by creating a secure string parameter. Use multi-Region secret replication for the required Regions. Configure Systems Manager to rotate the secrets on a schedule.
C.
Store the credentials in an Amazon S3 bucket that has server-side encryption (SSE) enabled. Use Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) to invoke an AWS Lambda function to rotate the credentials.
D.
Encrypt the credentials as secrets by using AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) multi-Region customer managed keys. Store the secrets in an Amazon DynamoDB global table. Use an AWS Lambda function to retrieve the secrets from DynamoDB. Use the RDS API to rotate the secrets.

Answer: A

Explanation:
Keywords:
- rotate the credentials for its Amazon RDS for MySQL databases across multiple AWS Regions
- LEAST operational overhead
A: Correct - AWS Secrets Manager supports
- Encrypt credential for RDS, DocumentDb, Redshift, other DBs and key/value secret.
- multi-region replication.
- Remote base on schedule
B: Incorrect - Secure string parameter only apply for Parameter Store. All the data in AWS Secrets Manager is encrypted
C: Incorrect - don't mention about replicate S3 across region.
D: Incorrect - So many steps compare to answer A =))

Question 36
An application runs on Amazon EC2 instances across multiple Availability Zonas. The instances run in an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group behind an Application Load Balancer. The application performs best when the CPU utilization of the EC2 instances is at or near 40%.
What should a solutions architect do to maintain the desired performance across all instances in the group?
A.
Use a simple scaling policy to dynamically scale the Auto Scaling group.
B.
Use a target tracking policy to dynamically scale the Auto Scaling group.
C.
Use an AWS Lambda function ta update the desired Auto Scaling group capacity.
D.
Use scheduled scaling actions to scale up and scale down the Auto Scaling group.

Answer: B

Explanation:
The correct answer is B. To maintain the desired performance across all instances in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group, the solutions architect should use a target tracking policy to dynamically scale the Auto Scaling group.
A target tracking policy allows the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of EC2 instances in the group based on a target value for a metric. In this case, the target value for the CPU utilization metric could be set to 40% to maintain the desired performance of the application. The Auto Scaling group would then automatically scale the number of instances up or down as needed to maintain the target value for the metric.

Question 37
A company is developing a file-sharing application that will use an Amazon S3 bucket for storage. The company wants to serve all the files through an Amazon CloudFront distribution. The company does not want the files to be accessible through direct navigation to the S3 URL.
What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements?
A.
Write individual policies for each S3 bucket to grant read permission for only CloudFront access.
B.
Create an IAM user. Grant the user read permission to objects in the S3 bucket. Assign the user to CloudFront.
C.
Write an S3 bucket policy that assigns the CloudFront distribution ID as the Principal and assigns the target S3 bucket as the Amazon Resource Name (ARN).
D.
Create an origin access identity (OAI). Assign the OAI to the CloudFront distribution. Configure the S3 bucket permissions so that only the OAI has read permission.

Answer: D

Explanation:
I want to restrict access to my Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket so that objects can be accessed only through my Amazon CloudFront distribution. How can I do that?
Create a CloudFront origin access identity (OAI)
https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/cloudfront-access-to-amazon-s3/

The key reasons are:
An OAI provides secure access between CloudFront and S3 without exposing the S3 bucket publicly.
The OAI is associated with the CloudFront distribution.
The S3 bucket policy limits access only to that OAI.
This ensures only CloudFront can access the objects, not direct S3 access.
Option A is complex to manage individual bucket policies.
Option B exposes credentials that aren't needed.
Option C works but OAI is the preferred method.
So using an origin access identity provides the most secure way to serve private S3 content through CloudFront. The OAI prevents direct public access to the S3 bucket.

Question 38
A company’s website provides users with downloadable historical performance reports. The website needs a solution that will scale to meet the company’s website demands globally. The solution should be cost-effective, limit the provisioning of infrastructure resources, and provide the fastest possible response time.
Which combination should a solutions architect recommend to meet these requirements?
A.
Amazon CloudFront and Amazon S3
B.
AWS Lambda and Amazon DynamoDB
C.
Application Load Balancer with Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling
D.
Amazon Route 53 with internal Application Load Balancers

Answer: A

Explanation:
By using CloudFront, the website can leverage the global network of edge locations to cache and deliver the performance reports to users from the nearest edge location, reducing latency and providing fast response times. Amazon S3 serves as the origin for the files, where the reports are stored.
Option B is incorrect because AWS Lambda and Amazon DynamoDB are not the most suitable services for serving downloadable files and meeting the website demands globally.
Option C is incorrect because using an Application Load Balancer with Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling may require more infrastructure provisioning and management compared to the CloudFront and S3 combination. Additionally, it may not provide the same level of global scalability and fast response times as CloudFront.
Option D is incorrect because while Amazon Route 53 is a global DNS service, it alone does not provide the caching and content delivery capabilities required for serving the downloadable reports. Internal Application Load Balancers do not address the global scalability and caching requirements specified in the scenario.

Question 39
A company runs an Oracle database on premises. As part of the company’s migration to AWS, the company wants to upgrade the database to the most recent available version. The company also wants to set up disaster recovery (DR) for the database. The company needs to minimize the operational overhead for normal operations and DR setup. The company also needs to maintain access to the database's underlying operating system.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Migrate the Oracle database to an Amazon EC2 instance. Set up database replication to a different AWS Region.
B.
Migrate the Oracle database to Amazon RDS for Oracle. Activate Cross-Region automated backups to replicate the snapshots to another AWS Region.
C.
Migrate the Oracle database to Amazon RDS Custom for Oracle. Create a read replica for the database in another AWS Region.
D.
Migrate the Oracle database to Amazon RDS for Oracle. Create a standby database in another Availability Zone.

Answer: C

Explanation:
It should be C:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/rds-custom.html
and
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/working-with-custom-oracle.html

B, D - do not have access to underlying OS.
Both A and C could work, but C is less Overhead.
C - Amazon RDS Custom for Oracle actually supports creating read replicas. "Creating an RDS Custom for Oracle replica is similar to creating an RDS for Oracle replica, but with important differences." (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/custom-rr.html). The read replica is not meant for disaster recovery, but it could work as such when no better options are available.

Question 40
A company wants to move its application to a serverless solution. The serverless solution needs to analyze existing and new data by using SL. The company stores the data in an Amazon S3 bucket. The data requires encryption and must be replicated to a different AWS Region.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?
A.
Create a new S3 bucket. Load the data into the new S3 bucket. Use S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR) to replicate encrypted objects to an S3 bucket in another Region. Use server-side encryption with AWS KMS multi-Region kays (SSE-KMS). Use Amazon Athena to query the data.
B.
Create a new S3 bucket. Load the data into the new S3 bucket. Use S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR) to replicate encrypted objects to an S3 bucket in another Region. Use server-side encryption with AWS KMS multi-Region keys (SSE-KMS). Use Amazon RDS to query the data.
C.
Load the data into the existing S3 bucket. Use S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR) to replicate encrypted objects to an S3 bucket in another Region. Use server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed encryption keys (SSE-S3). Use Amazon Athena to query the data.
D.
Load the data into the existing S3 bucket. Use S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR) to replicate encrypted objects to an S3 bucket in another Region. Use server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed encryption keys (SSE-S3). Use Amazon RDS to query the data.

SSE-KMS vs SSE-S3 - The last seems to have less overhead (as the keys are automatically generated by S3 and applied on data at upload, and don't require further actions. KMS provides more flexibility, but in turn involves a different service, which finally is more "complex" than just managing one (S3). So A and B are excluded. If you are in doubt, you are having 2 buckets in A and B, while just keeping one in C and D.
https://s3browser.com/server-side-encryption-types.aspx
Decide between C and D is deciding on Athena or RDS. RDS is a relational db, and we have documents on S3, which is the use case for Athena. Athena is also serverless, which eliminates the need of controlling the underlying infrastructure and capacity. So C is the answer.
https://aws.amazon.com/athena/

Answer is A:
Amazon S3 Bucket Keys reduce the cost of Amazon S3 server-side encryption using AWS Key Management Service (SSE-KMS). This new bucket-level key for SSE can reduce AWS KMS request costs by up to 99 percent by decreasing the request traffic from Amazon S3 to AWS KMS. With a few clicks in the AWS Management Console, and without any changes to your client applications, you can configure your bucket to use an S3 Bucket Key for AWS KMS-based encryption on new objects.
The Existing S3 bucket might have uncrypted data - encryption will apply new data received after the applying of encryption on the new bucket.

Question 41
A company runs workloads on AWS. The company needs to connect to a service from an external provider. The service is hosted in the provider's VPC. According to the company’s security team, the connectivity must be private and must be restricted to the target service. The connection must be initiated only from the company’s VPC.
Which solution will mast these requirements?
A.
Create a VPC peering connection between the company's VPC and the provider's VPC. Update the route table to connect to the target service.
B.
Ask the provider to create a virtual private gateway in its VPC. Use AWS PrivateLink to connect to the target service.
C.
Create a NAT gateway in a public subnet of the company’s VPUpdate the route table to connect to the target service.
D.
Ask the provider to create a VPC endpoint for the target service. Use AWS PrivateLink to connect to the target service.

Answer: D

Explanation:
**AWS PrivateLink provides private connectivity between VPCs, AWS services, and your on-premises networks, without exposing your traffic to the public internet**. AWS PrivateLink makes it easy to connect services across different accounts and VPCs to significantly simplify your network architecture.
Interface **VPC endpoints**, powered by AWS PrivateLink, connect you to services hosted by AWS Partners and supported solutions available in AWS Marketplace.
https://aws.amazon.com/privatelink/

Option A VPC peering connection may not meet security requirement as it can allow communication between all resources in both VPCs.
Option B, asking the provider to create a virtual private gateway in its VPC and use AWS PrivateLink to connect to the target service is not the optimal solution because it may require the provider to make changes and also you may face security issues.
Option C, creating a NAT gateway in a public subnet of the company’s VPC can expose the target service to the internet, which would not meet the security requirements.

Question 42
A company is migrating its on-premises PostgreSQL database to Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL. The on-premises database must remain online and accessible during the migration. The Aurora database must remain synchronized with the on-premises database.
Which combination of actions must a solutions architect take to meet these requirements? (Choose two.)

Question 43
A company uses AWS Organizations to create dedicated AWS accounts for each business unit to manage each business unit's account independently upon request. The root email recipient missed a notification that was sent to the root user email address of one account. The company wants to ensure that all future notifications are not missed. Future notifications must be limited to account administrators.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Configure the company’s email server to forward notification email messages that are sent to the AWS account root user email address to all users in the organization.
B.
Configure all AWS account root user email addresses as distribution lists that go to a few administrators who can respond to alerts. Configure AWS account alternate contacts in the AWS Organizations console or programmatically.
C.
Configure all AWS account root user email messages to be sent to one administrator who is responsible for monitoring alerts and forwarding those alerts to the appropriate groups.
D.
Configure all existing AWS accounts and all newly created accounts to use the same root user email address. Configure AWS account alternate contacts in the AWS Organizations console or programmatically.

Answer: B

Explanation:
Option B ensures that all future notifications are not missed by configuring the AWS account root user email addresses as distribution lists that are monitored by a few administrators. By setting up alternate contacts in the AWS Organizations console or programmatically, the notifications can be sent to the appropriate administrators responsible for monitoring and responding to alerts. This solution allows for centralized management of notifications and ensures they are limited to account administrators.
A. Floods all users with notifications, lacks granularity.
C. Manual forwarding introduces delays, centralizes responsibility.
D. No flexibility for specific account administrators, limits customization.

Use a group email address for the management account's root user

Question 44
A company runs its ecommerce application on AWS. Every new order is published as a massage in a RabbitMQ queue that runs on an Amazon EC2 instance in a single Availability Zone. These messages are processed by a different application that runs on a separate EC2 instance. This application stores the details in a PostgreSQL database on another EC2 instance. All the EC2 instances are in the same Availability Zone.
The company needs to redesign its architecture to provide the highest availability with the least operational overhead.
What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements?
A.
Migrate the queue to a redundant pair (active/standby) of RabbitMQ instances on Amazon MQ. Create a Multi-AZ Auto Scaling group for EC2 instances that host the application. Create another Multi-AZ Auto Scaling group for EC2 instances that host the PostgreSQL database.
B.
Migrate the queue to a redundant pair (active/standby) of RabbitMQ instances on Amazon MQ. Create a Multi-AZ Auto Scaling group for EC2 instances that host the application. Migrate the database to run on a Multi-AZ deployment of Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL.
C.
Create a Multi-AZ Auto Scaling group for EC2 instances that host the RabbitMQ queue. Create another Multi-AZ Auto Scaling group for EC2 instances that host the application. Migrate the database to run on a Multi-AZ deployment of Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL.
D.
Create a Multi-AZ Auto Scaling group for EC2 instances that host the RabbitMQ queue. Create another Multi-AZ Auto Scaling group for EC2 instances that host the application. Create a third Multi-AZ Auto Scaling group for EC2 instances that host the PostgreSQL database

Answer: B

Explanation:
To meet the requirements of providing the highest availability with the least operational overhead, the solutions architect should take the following actions:
* By migrating the queue to Amazon MQ, the architect can take advantage of the built-in high availability and failover capabilities of the service, which will help ensure that messages are delivered reliably and without interruption.
* By creating a Multi-AZ Auto Scaling group for the EC2 instances that host the application, the architect can ensure that the application is highly available and able to handle increased traffic without the need for manual intervention.
* By migrating the database to a Multi-AZ deployment of Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL, the architect can take advantage of the built-in high availability and failover capabilities of the service, which will help ensure that the database is always available and able to handle increased traffic.

Migrating to Amazon MQ reduces the overhead on the queue management. C and D are dismissed.
Deciding between A and B means deciding to go for an AutoScaling group for EC2 or an RDS for Postgress (both multi- AZ). The RDS option has less operational impact, as provide as a service the tools and software required. Consider for instance, the effort to add an additional node like a read replica, to the DB.

Question 45
A reporting team receives files each day in an Amazon S3 bucket. The reporting team manually reviews and copies the files from this initial S3 bucket to an analysis S3 bucket each day at the same time to use with Amazon QuickSight. Additional teams are starting to send more files in larger sizes to the initial S3 bucket.
The reporting team wants to move the files automatically analysis S3 bucket as the files enter the initial S3 bucket. The reporting team also wants to use AWS Lambda functions to run pattern-matching code on the copied data. In addition, the reporting team wants to send the data files to a pipeline in Amazon SageMaker Pipelines.
What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?
A.
Create a Lambda function to copy the files to the analysis S3 bucket. Create an S3 event notification for the analysis S3 bucket. Configure Lambda and SageMaker Pipelines as destinations of the event notification. Configure s3:ObjectCreated:Put as the event type.
B.
Create a Lambda function to copy the files to the analysis S3 bucket. Configure the analysis S3 bucket to send event notifications to Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events). Configure an ObjectCreated rule in EventBridge (CloudWatch Events). Configure Lambda and SageMaker Pipelines as targets for the rule.
C.
Configure S3 replication between the S3 buckets. Create an S3 event notification for the analysis S3 bucket. Configure Lambda and SageMaker Pipelines as destinations of the event notification. Configure s3:ObjectCreated:Put as the event type.
D.
Configure S3 replication between the S3 buckets. Configure the analysis S3 bucket to send event notifications to Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events). Configure an ObjectCreated rule in EventBridge (CloudWatch Events). Configure Lambda and SageMaker Pipelines as targets for the rule.

Answer: D

Explanation:
A and B says you are copying the file to another bucket using lambda,
C an D just uses S3 replication to copy the files,
They are doing exactly the same thing while C and D do not require setting up of lambda, which should be more efficient
The question says the team is manually copying the files, automatically replicating the files should be the most efficient method vs manually copying or copying with lambda.

Also read this https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/EventNotifications.html
Lambda and Sagemaker are not supported destinations for S3 Event Notifications

Question 46
A company runs an ecommerce application on Amazon EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer. The instances run in an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group across multiple Availability Zones. The Auto Scaling group scales based on CPU utilization metrics. The ecommerce application stores the transaction data in a MySQL 8.0 database that is hosted on a large EC2 instance.
The database's performance degrades quickly as application load increases. The application handles more read requests than write transactions. The company wants a solution that will automatically scale the database to meet the demand of unpredictable read workloads while maintaining high availability.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Use Amazon Redshift with a single node for leader and compute functionality.
B.
Use Amazon RDS with a Single-AZ deployment Configure Amazon RDS to add reader instances in a different Availability Zone.
C.
Use Amazon Aurora with a Multi-AZ deployment. Configure Aurora Auto Scaling with Aurora Replicas.
D.
Use Amazon ElastiCache for Memcached with EC2 Spot Instances.

Answer: C

Explanation:
Option C, using Amazon Aurora with a Multi-AZ deployment and configuring Aurora Auto Scaling with Aurora Replicas, would be the best solution to meet the requirements.
Aurora is a fully managed, MySQL-compatible relational database that is designed for high performance and high availability. Aurora Multi-AZ deployments automatically maintain a synchronous standby replica in a different Availability Zone to provide high availability. Additionally, Aurora Auto Scaling allows you to automatically scale the number of Aurora Replicas in response to read workloads, allowing you to meet the demand of unpredictable read workloads while maintaining high availability. This would provide an automated solution for scaling the database to meet the demand of the application while maintaining high availability.

AURORA is 5x performance improvement over MySQL on RDS and handles more read requests than write,; maintaining high availability = Multi-AZ deployment

Question 47
A solutions architect needs to help a company optimize the cost of running an application on AWS. The application will use Amazon EC2 instances, AWS Fargate, and AWS Lambda for compute within the architecture.
The EC2 instances will run the data ingestion layer of the application. EC2 usage will be sporadic and unpredictable. Workloads that run on EC2 instances can be interrupted at any time. The application front end will run on Fargate, and Lambda will serve the API layer. The front-end utilization and API layer utilization will be predictable over the course of the next year.
Which combination of purchasing options will provide the MOST cost-effective solution for hosting this application? (Choose two.)
A.
Use Spot Instances for the data ingestion layer
B.
Use On-Demand Instances for the data ingestion layer
C.
Purchase a 1-year Compute Savings Plan for the front end and API layer.
D.
Purchase 1-year All Upfront Reserved instances for the data ingestion layer.
E.
Purchase a 1-year EC2 instance Savings Plan for the front end and API layer.

Answer: AC

Explanation:
EC2 instance Savings Plan saves 72% while Compute Savings Plans saves 66%. But according to link, it says "Compute Savings Plans provide the most flexibility and help to reduce your costs by up to 66%. These plans automatically apply to EC2 instance usage regardless of instance family, size, AZ, region, OS or tenancy, and also apply to Fargate and Lambda usage." EC2 instance Savings Plans are not applied to Fargate or Lambda

The two most cost-effective purchasing options for this architecture are:
A) Use Spot Instances for the data ingestion layer
C) Purchase a 1-year Compute Savings Plan for the front end and API layer
The reasons are:
Spot Instances provide the greatest savings for flexible, interruptible EC2 workloads like data ingestion.
Savings Plans offer significant discounts for predictable usage like the front end and API layer.
All Upfront and partial/no Upfront RI's don't align well with the sporadic EC2 usage.
On-Demand is more expensive than Spot for flexible EC2 workloads.
By matching purchasing options to the workload patterns, Spot for unpredictable EC2 and Savings Plans for steady-state usage, the solutions architect optimizes cost efficiency.

Question 48
A company runs a web-based portal that provides users with global breaking news, local alerts, and weather updates. The portal delivers each user a personalized view by using mixture of static and dynamic content. Content is served over HTTPS through an API server running on an Amazon EC2 instance behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB). The company wants the portal to provide this content to its users across the world as quickly as possible.
How should a solutions architect design the application to ensure the LEAST amount of latency for all users?
A.
Deploy the application stack in a single AWS Region. Use Amazon CloudFront to serve all static and dynamic content by specifying the ALB as an origin.
B.
Deploy the application stack in two AWS Regions. Use an Amazon Route 53 latency routing policy to serve all content from the ALB in the closest Region.
C.
Deploy the application stack in a single AWS Region. Use Amazon CloudFront to serve the static content. Serve the dynamic content directly from the ALB.
D.
Deploy the application stack in two AWS Regions. Use an Amazon Route 53 geolocation routing policy to serve all content from the ALB in the closest Region.

Answer: A

Explanation:
Amazon CloudFront is a web service that speeds up distribution of your static and dynamic web content
https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/amazon/view/81081-exam-aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c02/

Question 49
A gaming company is designing a highly available architecture. The application runs on a modified Linux kernel and supports only UDP-based traffic. The company needs the front-end tier to provide the best possible user experience. That tier must have low latency, route traffic to the nearest edge location, and provide static IP addresses for entry into the application endpoints.
What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements?
A.
Configure Amazon Route 53 to forward requests to an Application Load Balancer. Use AWS Lambda for the application in AWS Application Auto Scaling.
B.
Configure Amazon CloudFront to forward requests to a Network Load Balancer. Use AWS Lambda for the application in an AWS Application Auto Scaling group.
C.
Configure AWS Global Accelerator to forward requests to a Network Load Balancer. Use Amazon EC2 instances for the application in an EC2 Auto Scaling group.
D.
Configure Amazon API Gateway to forward requests to an Application Load Balancer. Use Amazon EC2 instances for the application in an EC2 Auto Scaling group.

Answer: C

Explanation:
AWS Global Accelerator and Amazon CloudFront are separate services that use the AWS global network and its edge locations around the world. CloudFront improves performance for both cacheable content (such as images and videos) and dynamic content (such as API acceleration and dynamic site delivery). Global Accelerator improves performance for a wide range of applications over TCP or UDP by proxying packets at the edge to applications running in one or more AWS Regions. Global Accelerator is a good fit for non-HTTP use cases, such as gaming (UDP), IoT (MQTT), or Voice over IP, as well as for HTTP use cases that specifically require static IP addresses or deterministic, fast regional failover. Both services integrate with AWS Shield for DDoS protection.

* AWS Global Accelerator is a service that routes traffic to the nearest edge location, providing low latency and static IP addresses for the front-end tier. It supports UDP-based traffic, which is required by the application.
* A Network Load Balancer is a layer 4 load balancer that can handle UDP traffic and provide static IP addresses for the application endpoints.
* An EC2 Auto Scaling group ensures that the required number of Amazon EC2 instances is available to meet the demand of the application. This will help the front-end tier to provide the best possible user experience.
Option A is not a valid solution because Amazon Route 53 does not support UDP traffic.
Option B is not a valid solution because Amazon CloudFront does not support UDP traffic.
Option D is not a valid solution because Amazon API Gateway does not support UDP traffic.

Question 50
A company wants to migrate its existing on-premises monolithic application to AWS. The company wants to keep as much of the front-end code and the backend code as possible. However, the company wants to break the application into smaller applications. A different team will manage each application. The company needs a highly scalable solution that minimizes operational overhead.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Host the application on AWS Lambda. Integrate the application with Amazon API Gateway.
B.
Host the application with AWS Amplify. Connect the application to an Amazon API Gateway API that is integrated with AWS Lambda.
C.
Host the application on Amazon EC2 instances. Set up an Application Load Balancer with EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group as targets.
D.
Host the application on Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS). Set up an Application Load Balancer with Amazon ECS as the target.

Answer: D

Explanation:
ECS allows running Docker containers, so the existing monolithic app can be containerized and run on ECS with minimal code changes.
The app can be broken into smaller microservices by containerizing different components and managing them separately.
ECS provides auto scaling capabilities to scale each microservice independently.
Using an Application Load Balancer with ECS enables distributing traffic across containers and auto scaling.
ECS has minimal operational overhead compared to managing EC2 instances directly.
Serverless options like Lambda and API Gateway would require significant code refactoring which is not ideal for migrating an existing app.

https://aws.amazon.com/tutorials/break-monolith-app-microservices-ecs-docker-ec2/module-three/
This page explained clearly why D is the correct answer

Question 51
A company recently started using Amazon Aurora as the data store for its global ecommerce application. When large reports are run, developers report that the ecommerce application is performing poorly. After reviewing metrics in Amazon CloudWatch, a solutions architect finds that the ReadIOPS and CPUUtilizalion metrics are spiking when monthly reports run.
What is the MOST cost-effective solution?
A.
Migrate the monthly reporting to Amazon Redshift.
B.
Migrate the monthly reporting to an Aurora Replica.
C.
Migrate the Aurora database to a larger instance class.
D.
Increase the Provisioned IOPS on the Aurora instance.

Answer: B

Explanation:
Option B: Migrating the monthly reporting to an Aurora Replica may be the most cost-effective solution because it involves creating a read-only copy of the database that can be used specifically for running large reports without impacting the performance of the primary database. This solution allows the company to scale the read capacity of the database without incurring additional hardware or I/O costs.

The incorrect solutions are:
Option A: Migrating the monthly reporting to Amazon Redshift may not be cost-effective because it involves creating a new data store and potentially significant data migration and ETL costs.
Option C: Migrating the Aurora database to a larger instance class may not be cost-effective because it involves changing the underlying hardware of the database and potentially incurring additional costs for the larger instance.
Option D: Increasing the Provisioned IOPS on the Aurora instance may not be cost-effective because it involves paying for additional I/O capacity that may not be necessary for other workloads on the database.

Question 52
A company hosts a website analytics application on a single Amazon EC2 On-Demand Instance. The analytics software is written in PHP and uses a MySQL database. The analytics software, the web server that provides PHP, and the database server are all hosted on the EC2 instance. The application is showing signs of performance degradation during busy times and is presenting 5xx errors. The company needs to make the application scale seamlessly.
Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?
A.
Migrate the database to an Amazon RDS for MySQL DB instance. Create an AMI of the web application. Use the AMI to launch a second EC2 On-Demand Instance. Use an Application Load Balancer to distribute the load to each EC2 instance.
B.
Migrate the database to an Amazon RDS for MySQL DB instance. Create an AMI of the web application. Use the AMI to launch a second EC2 On-Demand Instance. Use Amazon Route 53 weighted routing to distribute the load across the two EC2 instances.
C.
Migrate the database to an Amazon Aurora MySQL DB instance. Create an AWS Lambda function to stop the EC2 instance and change the instance type. Create an Amazon CloudWatch alarm to invoke the Lambda function when CPU utilization surpasses 75%.
D.
Migrate the database to an Amazon Aurora MySQL DB instance. Create an AMI of the web application. Apply the AMI to a launch template. Create an Auto Scaling group with the launch template Configure the launch template to use a Spot Fleet. Attach an Application Load Balancer to the Auto Scaling group.

Answer: D

Explanation:
I was tempted to pick A but then I realized there are two key requirements:
- scale seamlessly
- cost-effectively
None of A-C give seamless scalability. A and B are about adding second instance (which I assume does not match to "scale seamlessly"). C is about changing instance type.
Therefore D is only workable solution to the scalability requirement

The key reasons are:
Migrating the database to Amazon Aurora MySQL provides a scalable, high performance database to support the application.
Creating an AMI of the web application and using it in an Auto Scaling group with Spot instances allows cheap and efficient scaling of the web tier.
The Application Load Balancer distributes traffic across the Auto Scaling group.
Spot instances in an Auto Scaling group allow cost-optimized automatic scaling based on demand.
This approach provides high availability and seamless scaling without manual intervention.

Question 53
A company runs a stateless web application in production on a group of Amazon EC2 On-Demand Instances behind an Application Load Balancer. The application experiences heavy usage during an 8-hour period each business day. Application usage is moderate and steady overnight. Application usage is low during weekends.
The company wants to minimize its EC2 costs without affecting the availability of the application.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Use Spot Instances for the entire workload.
B.
Use Reserved Instances for the baseline level of usage. Use Spot instances for any additional capacity that the application needs.
C.
Use On-Demand Instances for the baseline level of usage. Use Spot Instances for any additional capacity that the application needs.
D.
Use Dedicated Instances for the baseline level of usage. Use On-Demand Instances for any additional capacity that the application needs.

Answer: B

Explanation:
Reserved is cheaper than on demand the company has. And it's meet the availabilty (HA) requirement as to spot instance that can be disrupted at any time.
PRICING BELOW.
On-Demand: 0% There’s no commitment from you. You pay the most with this option.
Reserved : 40%-60%1-year or 3-year commitment from you. You save money from that commitment.
Spot 50%-90% Ridiculously inexpensive because there’s no commitment from the AWS side.

Usage is either "heavy" (during the 8 hours), "moderate and steady" (overnight) or "low" (during weekends). So there is always SOME usage, which could be covered by a few Reserved Instances (which would be cheaper than On-Demand Instances).
A - "Spot instances for the entire workload", might 'affect the availability of the application'
B - Seems the best answer
C - More expensive than B
D - Dedicated instances aka dedicated hardware -> very expensive

Question 54
A company needs to retain application log files for a critical application for 10 years. The application team regularly accesses logs from the past month for troubleshooting, but logs older than 1 month are rarely accessed. The application generates more than 10 TB of logs per month.
Which storage option meets these requirements MOST cost-effectively?
A.
Store the logs in Amazon S3. Use AWS Backup to move logs more than 1 month old to S3 Glacier Deep Archive.
B.
Store the logs in Amazon S3. Use S3 Lifecycle policies to move logs more than 1 month old to S3 Glacier Deep Archive.
C.
Store the logs in Amazon CloudWatch Logs. Use AWS Backup to move logs more than 1 month old to S3 Glacier Deep Archive.
D.
Store the logs in Amazon CloudWatch Logs. Use Amazon S3 Lifecycle policies to move logs more than 1 month old to S3 Glacier Deep Archive.

Answer: B

Explanation:
Why not AwsBackup? No Glacier Deep is supported by AWS Backup
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/s3-backups.html
AWS Backup allows you to backup your S3 data stored in the following S3 Storage Classes:
• S3 Standard
• S3 Standard - Infrequently Access (IA)
• S3 One Zone-IA
• S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval
• S3 Intelligent-Tiering (S3 INT)

B is the most cost-effective solution. Storing the logs in S3 and using S3 Lifecycle policies to transition logs older than 1 month to S3 Glacier Deep Archive allows for cost optimization based on data access patterns. Since logs older than 1 month are rarely accessed, moving them to S3 Glacier Deep Archive helps minimize storage costs while still retaining the logs for the required 10-year period.
A is incorrect because using AWS Backup to move logs to S3 Glacier Deep Archive can incur additional costs and complexity compared to using S3 Lifecycle policies directly.
C adds unnecessary complexity and costs by involving CloudWatch Logs and AWS Backup when direct management through S3 is sufficient.
D is incorrect because using S3 Lifecycle policies to move logs from CloudWatch Logs to S3 Glacier Deep Archive is not a valid option. CloudWatch Logs and S3 have separate storage mechanisms, and S3 Lifecycle policies cannot be applied directly to CloudWatch Logs.

Question 55
A company has a data ingestion workflow that includes the following components:
An Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic that receives notifications about new data deliveries
An AWS Lambda function that processes and stores the data
The ingestion workflow occasionally fails because of network connectivity issues. When failure occurs, the corresponding data is not ingested unless the company manually reruns the job.
What should a solutions architect do to ensure that all notifications are eventually processed?
A.
Configure the Lambda function for deployment across multiple Availability Zones.
B.
Modify the Lambda function's configuration to increase the CPU and memory allocations for the function.
C.
Configure the SNS topic’s retry strategy to increase both the number of retries and the wait time between retries.
D.
Configure an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue as the on-failure destination. Modify the Lambda function to process messages in the queue.

Answer: D

Explanation:
To ensure that all notifications are eventually processed, the best solution would be to configure an Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) queue as the on-failure destination for the SNS topic. This will allow the notifications to be retried until they are successfully processed. The Lambda function can then be modified to process messages in the queue, ensuring that all notifications are eventually processed. Option D, "Configure an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue as the on-failure destination. Modify the Lambda function to process messages in the queue," is the correct answer.

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-message-delivery-retries.html

Question 56
A company has a service that produces event data. The company wants to use AWS to process the event data as it is received. The data is written in a specific order that must be maintained throughout processing. The company wants to implement a solution that minimizes operational overhead.
How should a solutions architect accomplish this?
A.
Create an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) FIFO queue to hold messages. Set up an AWS Lambda function to process messages from the queue.
B.
Create an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic to deliver notifications containing payloads to process. Configure an AWS Lambda function as a subscriber.
C.
Create an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) standard queue to hold messages. Set up an AWS Lambda function to process messages from the queue independently.
D.
Create an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic to deliver notifications containing payloads to process. Configure an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue as a subscriber.

Answer: A

Explanation:
A is the correct solution. By creating an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) FIFO queue to hold messages and setting up an AWS Lambda function to process messages from the queue, the company can ensure that the order of the event data is maintained throughout processing. SQS FIFO queues guarantee the order of messages and are suitable for scenarios where strict message ordering is required.
B is incorrect because Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topics are not designed to preserve message order. SNS is a publish-subscribe messaging service and does not guarantee the order of message delivery.
C is incorrect because using an SQS standard queue does not guarantee the order of message processing. SQS standard queues provide high throughput and scale, but they do not guarantee strict message ordering.
D is incorrect because configuring an SQS queue as a subscriber to an SNS topic does not ensure message ordering. SNS topics distribute messages to subscribers independently, and the order of message processing is not guaranteed.

Question 57
A company recently migrated to AWS and wants to implement a solution to protect the traffic that flows in and out of the production VPC. The company had an inspection server in its on-premises data center. The inspection server performed specific operations such as traffic flow inspection and traffic filtering. The company wants to have the same functionalities in the AWS Cloud.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Use Amazon GuardDuty for traffic inspection and traffic filtering in the production VPC.
B.
Use Traffic Mirroring to mirror traffic from the production VPC for traffic inspection and filtering.
C.
Use AWS Network Firewall to create the required rules for traffic inspection and traffic filtering for the production VPC.
D.
Use AWS Firewall Manager to create the required rules for traffic inspection and traffic filtering for the production VPC.

Answer: C

Explanation:
AWS Network Firewall is a managed firewall service that provides filtering for both inbound and outbound network traffic. It allows you to create rules for traffic inspection and filtering, which can help protect your production VPC.
Option A: Amazon GuardDuty is a threat detection service, not a traffic inspection or filtering service.
Option B: Traffic Mirroring is a feature that allows you to replicate and send a copy of network traffic from a VPC to another VPC or on-premises location. It is not a service that performs traffic inspection or filtering.
Option D: AWS Firewall Manager is a security management service that helps you to centrally configure and manage firewalls across your accounts. It is not a service that performs traffic inspection or filtering.

Network Firewall to define firewall rules for traffic inspection.
A: GuardDuty is not for this
B: Wrong product
D: Firewall Manager does not monitor traffic, it manages firewall

Question 58
A company is migrating an application from on-premises servers to Amazon EC2 instances. As part of the migration design requirements, a solutions architect must implement infrastructure metric alarms. The company does not need to take action if CPU utilization increases to more than 50% for a short burst of time. However, if the CPU utilization increases to more than 50% and read IOPS on the disk are high at the same time, the company needs to act as soon as possible. The solutions architect also must reduce false alarms.
What should the solutions architect do to meet these requirements?
A.
Create Amazon CloudWatch composite alarms where possible.
B.
Create Amazon CloudWatch dashboards to visualize the metrics and react to issues quickly.
C.
Create Amazon CloudWatch Synthetics canaries to monitor the application and raise an alarm.
D.
Create single Amazon CloudWatch metric alarms with multiple metric thresholds where possible.

Answer: A

Explanation:
Composite alarms determine their states by monitoring the states of other alarms. You can **use composite alarms to reduce alarm noise**. For example, you can create a composite alarm where the underlying metric alarms go into ALARM when they meet specific conditions. You then can set up your composite alarm to go into ALARM and send you notifications when the underlying metric alarms go into ALARM by configuring the underlying metric alarms never to take actions. Currently, composite alarms can take the following actions:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Create_Composite_Alarm.html

Composite for multiple conditions like AND/OR combinations
B: This option just made me laugh. Lol, will someone just sit and look at this dashboard?
C: CW Synthetics canaries if for API
D: Single won't monitor multiple metrics

Question 59
A company wants to migrate its on-premises data center to AWS. According to the company's compliance requirements, the company can use only the ap-northeast-3 Region. Company administrators are not permitted to connect VPCs to the internet.
Which solutions will meet these requirements? (Choose two.)
A.
Use AWS Control Tower to implement data residency guardrails to deny internet access and deny access to all AWS Regions except ap-northeast-3.
B.
Use rules in AWS WAF to prevent internet access. Deny access to all AWS Regions except ap-northeast-3 in the AWS account settings.
C.
Use AWS Organizations to configure service control policies (SCPS) that prevent VPCs from gaining internet access. Deny access to all AWS Regions except ap-northeast-3.
D.
Create an outbound rule for the network ACL in each VPC to deny all traffic from 0.0.0.0/0. Create an IAM policy for each user to prevent the use of any AWS Region other than ap-northeast-3.
E.
Use AWS Config to activate managed rules to detect and alert for internet gateways and to detect and alert for new resources deployed outside of ap-northeast-3.

Answer: AC

Explanation:
A. By using Control Tower, the company can enforce data residency guardrails and restrict internet access for VPCs and denies access to all Regions except the required ap-northeast-3 Region.
C. With Organizations, the company can configure SCPs to prevent VPCs from gaining internet access. By denying access to all Regions except ap-northeast-3, the company ensures that VPCs can only be deployed in the specified Region.
Option B is incorrect because using rules in AWS WAF alone does not address the requirement of denying access to all AWS Regions except ap-northeast-3.
Option D is incorrect because configuring outbound rules in network ACLs and IAM policies for users can help restrict traffic and access, but it does not enforce the company's requirement of denying access to all Regions except ap-northeast-3.
Option E is incorrect because using AWS Config and managed rules can help detect and alert for specific resources and configurations, but it does not directly enforce the restriction of internet access or deny access to specific Regions.

Question 60
A company uses a three-tier web application to provide training to new employees. The application is accessed for only 12 hours every day. The company is using an Amazon RDS for MySQL DB instance to store information and wants to minimize costs.
What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements?
A.
Configure an IAM policy for AWS Systems Manager Session Manager. Create an IAM role for the policy. Update the trust relationship of the role. Set up automatic start and stop for the DB instance.
B.
Create an Amazon ElastiCache for Redis cache cluster that gives users the ability to access the data from the cache when the DB instance is stopped. Invalidate the cache after the DB instance is started.
C.
Launch an Amazon EC2 instance. Create an IAM role that grants access to Amazon RDS. Attach the role to the EC2 instance. Configure a cron job to start and stop the EC2 instance on the desired schedule.
D.
Create AWS Lambda functions to start and stop the DB instance. Create Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) scheduled rules to invoke the Lambda functions. Configure the Lambda functions as event targets for the rules.

Answer: D

Explanation:
Although both A and D is a workable solution, the requirements is to minimum cost.
The benefits of automating the startup and shutdown of RDS DB instances using Lambda allows organizations to further reduce compute costs and simplify the administration of database environments that don’t need to be running continuously.
https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/schedule-amazon-rds-stop-and-start-using-aws-lambda/
For using system manager to accomplish the task works however keep in mind that although we’re stopping the databases, the storage costs for the databases still apply.
https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/schedule-amazon-rds-stop-and-start-using-aws-systems-manager/
Initially I also thought that A would be the correct answer however looking at the administration and cost I would go for D as a better solution instead.

https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/schedule-amazon-rds-stop-and-start-using-aws-lambda/
It is option D. Option A could have been applicable had it been AWS Systems Manager State Manager & not AWS Systems Manager Session Manager

Question 61
A company sells ringtones created from clips of popular songs. The files containing the ringtones are stored in Amazon S3 Standard and are at least 128 KB in size. The company has millions of files, but downloads are infrequent for ringtones older than 90 days. The company needs to save money on storage while keeping the most accessed files readily available for its users.
Which action should the company take to meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?
A.
Configure S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) storage for the initial storage tier of the objects.
B.
Move the files to S3 Intelligent-Tiering and configure it to move objects to a less expensive storage tier after 90 days.
C.
Configure S3 inventory to manage objects and move them to S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-1A) after 90 days.
D.
Implement an S3 Lifecycle policy that moves the objects from S3 Standard to S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-1A) after 90 days.

Answer: B? D?

Explanation:
The Question talks about downloads are infrequent older than 90 days which means files less than 90 days are accessed frequently. Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) needs a minimum 30 days if accessed before, it costs more.
So to access the files frequently you need a S3 Standard . After 90 days you can move it to Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) as its going to be less frequently accessed

B. Move the files to S3 Intelligent-Tiering and configure it to move objects to a less expensive storage tier after 90 days.
Explanation:
S3 Intelligent-Tiering is a storage class that automatically moves objects between two access tiers: frequent access and infrequent access, based on access patterns.
By configuring S3 Intelligent-Tiering to move objects to a less expensive storage tier after 90 days of infrequent access, the company can save money on storage costs while ensuring that the most accessed files remain readily available.
This approach is more cost-effective than using S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) because it automatically adjusts storage tiers based on access patterns without the need for manual configuration or management.

Question 62
A company needs to save the results from a medical trial to an Amazon S3 repository. The repository must allow a few scientists to add new files and must restrict all other users to read-only access. No users can have the ability to modify or delete any files in the repository. The company must keep every file in the repository for a minimum of 1 year after its creation date.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Use S3 Object Lock in governance mode with a legal hold of 1 year.
B.
Use S3 Object Lock in compliance mode with a retention period of 365 days.
C.
Use an IAM role to restrict all users from deleting or changing objects in the S3 bucket. Use an S3 bucket policy to only allow the IAM role.
D.
Configure the S3 bucket to invoke an AWS Lambda function every time an object is added. Configure the function to track the hash of the saved object so that modified objects can be marked accordingly.

Answer: B

Explanation:
The key is "No users can have the ability to modify or delete any files" and compliance mode supports that.
I remember it this way: ( governance is like government, they set the rules but they can allow some people to break it :D )

Question 63
A large media company hosts a web application on AWS. The company wants to start caching confidential media files so that users around the world will have reliable access to the files. The content is stored in Amazon S3 buckets. The company must deliver the content quickly, regardless of where the requests originate geographically.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Use AWS DataSync to connect the S3 buckets to the web application.
B.
Deploy AWS Global Accelerator to connect the S3 buckets to the web application.
C.
Deploy Amazon CloudFront to connect the S3 buckets to CloudFront edge servers.
D.
Use Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) to connect the S3 buckets to the web application.

Answer: C

Explanation:
The reasons are:
Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) that caches content at edge locations around the world.
Connecting the S3 buckets containing the media files to CloudFront will cache the content at global edge locations.
This provides fast reliable access to users everywhere by serving content from the nearest edge location.
CloudFront integrates tightly with S3 for secure, durable storage.
Global Accelerator improves availability and performance for TCP/UDP traffic, not HTTP-based content delivery.
DataSync and SQS are not technologies for a global CDN like CloudFront.

CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) service provided by AWS. It caches content at edge locations worldwide, allowing users to access the content quickly regardless of their geographic location. By connecting the S3 to CloudFront, the media files can be cached at edge locations, ensuring reliable and fast delivery to users.
A. is a data transfer service that is not designed for caching or content delivery. It is used for transferring data between on-premises storage systems and AWS services.
B. is a service that improves the performance and availability of applications for global users. While it can provide fast and reliable access, it is not specifically designed for caching media files or connecting directly to S3.
D. is a message queue service that is not suitable for caching or content delivery. It is used for decoupling and coordinating message-based communication between different components of an application.
Therefore, the correct solution is option C, deploying CloudFront to connect the S3 to CloudFront edge servers.

Question 64
A company produces batch data that comes from different databases. The company also produces live stream data from network sensors and application APIs. The company needs to consolidate all the data into one place for business analytics. The company needs to process the incoming data and then stage the data in different Amazon S3 buckets. Teams will later run one-time queries and import the data into a business intelligence tool to show key performance indicators (KPIs).
Which combination of steps will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead? (Choose two.)
A.
Use Amazon Athena for one-time queries. Use Amazon QuickSight to create dashboards for KPIs.
B.
Use Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics for one-time queries. Use Amazon QuickSight to create dashboards for KPIs.
C.
Create custom AWS Lambda functions to move the individual records from the databases to an Amazon Redshift cluster.
D.
Use an AWS Glue extract, transform, and load (ETL) job to convert the data into JSON format. Load the data into multiple Amazon OpenSearch Service (Amazon Elasticsearch Service) clusters.
E.
Use blueprints in AWS Lake Formation to identify the data that can be ingested into a data lake. Use AWS Glue to crawl the source, extract the data, and load the data into Amazon S3 in Apache Parquet format.

Answer: AE

Explanation:
C and D = too much overhead
B = incorrect because Athena is used for one time queries.
That leaves A and E

AWS Lake Formation and Glue provide automated data lake creation with minimal coding. Glue crawlers identify sources and ETL jobs load to S3.
Athena allows ad-hoc queries directly on S3 data with no infrastructure to manage.
QuickSight provides easy cloud BI for dashboards.
Options C and D require significant custom coding for ETL and queries.
Redshift and OpenSearch would require additional setup and management overhead.

Question 65
A company stores data in an Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster. The company must store all the data for 5 years and must delete all the data after 5 years. The company also must indefinitely keep audit logs of actions that are performed within the database. Currently, the company has automated backups configured for Aurora.
Which combination of steps should a solutions architect take to meet these requirements? (Choose two.)
A.
Take a manual snapshot of the DB cluster.
B.
Create a lifecycle policy for the automated backups.
C.
Configure automated backup retention for 5 years.
D.
Configure an Amazon CloudWatch Logs export for the DB cluster.
E.
Use AWS Backup to take the backups and to keep the backups for 5 years.

Answer: DE

Explanation:
Previously, you had to create custom scripts to automate backup scheduling, enforce retention policies, or consolidate backup activity for manual Aurora cluster snapshots, especially when coordinating backups across AWS services. With AWS Backup, you gain a fully managed, policy-based backup solution with snapshot scheduling and snapshot retention management. You can now create, manage, and restore Aurora backups directly from the AWS Backup console for both PostgreSQL-compatible and MySQL-compatible versions of Aurora.
To get started, select an Amazon Aurora cluster from the AWS Backup console and take an on-demand backup or simply assign the cluster to a backup plan.

Question 66
A solutions architect is optimizing a website for an upcoming musical event. Videos of the performances will be streamed in real time and then will be available on demand. The event is expected to attract a global online audience.
Which service will improve the performance of both the real-time and on-demand streaming?
A.
Amazon CloudFront
B.
AWS Global Accelerator
C.
Amazon Route 53
D.
Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration

Answer: A

Explanation:
You can use CloudFront to deliver video on demand (VOD) or live streaming video using any HTTP origin
Global Accelerator is a good fit for non-HTTP use cases, such as gaming (UDP), IoT (MQTT), or Voice over IP, as well as for HTTP use cases that specifically require static IP addresses
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/on-demand-streaming-video.html

Question 67
A company is running a publicly accessible serverless application that uses Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda. The application’s traffic recently spiked due to fraudulent requests from botnets.
Which steps should a solutions architect take to block requests from unauthorized users? (Choose two.)
A.
Create a usage plan with an API key that is shared with genuine users only.
B.
Integrate logic within the Lambda function to ignore the requests from fraudulent IP addresses.
C.
Implement an AWS WAF rule to target malicious requests and trigger actions to filter them out.
D.
Convert the existing public API to a private API. Update the DNS records to redirect users to the new API endpoint.
E.
Create an IAM role for each user attempting to access the API. A user will assume the role when making the API call.

Answer: AC? CE?

Explanation:
Selected Answer: AC
C) Everyone agrees on C
B) Almost impossible cos how do you detect fraudulent IP address from a publicly accessible application
D) It's a publicly accessible application, converting the API to a private one defeats the purpose
E) IAM role for each user trying to access a publicly accessible API is impossible. It like creating an IAM for each user that tries to use google AUTH for their website
A) By implementing API keys and usage plans, you can restrict access to your API to only those users who possess the key, helping to limit fraudulent access.

Selected Answer: CE
C) WAF has bot identification and remedial tools, so it's CORRECT.
A) remember the question : "...block requests from unauthorized users?" -- an api key is involved in a authorization process. It's not the more secure process, but it's better than an totoally anonymous process. If you don't know the key, you can't authenticate. So the bots, at least the first days/weeks could not access the service (at the end they'll do, cos' the key will be spread informally). So it's CORRECT.
B) Implement a logic in the Lambda to detect fraudulent ip's is almost impossible, cos' it's a dynamic and changing pattern that you cannot handle easily.
D) creating a rol is not going to imply be more protected from unauth. request, because a rol is a "principal", it's not involved in the authorization process.

Question 68
A company hosts a data lake on AWS. The data lake consists of data in Amazon S3 and Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL. The company needs a reporting solution that provides data visualization and includes all the data sources within the data lake. Only the company's management team should have full access to all the visualizations. The rest of the company should have only limited access.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Create an analysis in Amazon QuickSight. Connect all the data sources and create new datasets. Publish dashboards to visualize the data. Share the dashboards with the appropriate IAM roles.
B.
Create an analysis in Amazon QuickSight. Connect all the data sources and create new datasets. Publish dashboards to visualize the data. Share the dashboards with the appropriate users and groups.
C.
Create an AWS Glue table and crawler for the data in Amazon S3. Create an AWS Glue extract, transform, and load (ETL) job to produce reports. Publish the reports to Amazon S3. Use S3 bucket policies to limit access to the reports.
D.
Create an AWS Glue table and crawler for the data in Amazon S3. Use Amazon Athena Federated Query to access data within Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL. Generate reports by using Amazon Athena. Publish the reports to Amazon S3. Use S3 bucket policies to limit access to the reports.

Answer: B

Explanation:
Keywords:
- Data lake on AWS.
- Consists of data in Amazon S3 and Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL.
- The company needs a reporting solution that provides data VISUALIZATION and includes ALL the data sources within the data lake.
A - Incorrect: Amazon QuickSight only support users(standard version) and groups (enterprise version). users and groups only exists without QuickSight. QuickSight don't support IAM. We use users and groups to view the QuickSight dashboard
B - Correct: as explained in answer A and QuickSight is used to created dashboard from S3, RDS, Redshift, Aurora, Athena, OpenSearch, Timestream
C - Incorrect: This way don't support visulization and don't mention how to process RDS data
D - Incorrect: This way don't support visulization and don't mention how to combine data RDS and S3

Question 69
An ecommerce company hosts its analytics application in the AWS Cloud. The application generates about 300 MB of data each month. The data is stored in JSON format. The company is evaluating a disaster recovery solution to back up the data. The data must be accessible in milliseconds if it is needed, and the data must be kept for 30 days.
Which solution meets these requirements MOST cost-effectively?
A. Amazon OpenSearch Service (Amazon Elasticsearch Service)
B. Amazon S3 Glacier
C. Amazon S3 Standard
D. Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL

Answer: C

Explanation:
S3 Standard provides high durability and availability for storage
It allows millisecond access to retrieve objects
Objects can be stored for any duration, meeting the 30 day retention need
Storage costs are low, around $0.023 per GB/month
OpenSearch and RDS require running and managing a cluster for DR storage
Glacier has lower cost but retrieval time is too high at 3-5 hours
S3 Standard's simplicity, high speed access, and low cost make it optimal for this small DR dataset that needs to be accessed quickly
https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/glacier/instant-retrieval/

Question 70
A company has a small Python application that processes JSON documents and outputs the results to an on-premises SQL database. The application runs thousands of times each day. The company wants to move the application to the AWS Cloud. The company needs a highly available solution that maximizes scalability and minimizes operational overhead.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Place the JSON documents in an Amazon S3 bucket. Run the Python code on multiple Amazon EC2 instances to process the documents. Store the results in an Amazon Aurora DB cluster.
B.
Place the JSON documents in an Amazon S3 bucket. Create an AWS Lambda function that runs the Python code to process the documents as they arrive in the S3 bucket. Store the results in an Amazon Aurora DB cluster.
C.
Place the JSON documents in an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume. Use the EBS Multi-Attach feature to attach the volume to multiple Amazon EC2 instances. Run the Python code on the EC2 instances to process the documents. Store the results on an Amazon RDS DB instance.
D.
Place the JSON documents in an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue as messages. Deploy the Python code as a container on an Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) cluster that is configured with the Amazon EC2 launch type. Use the container to process the SQS messages. Store the results on an Amazon RDS DB instance.

Answer: B

Explanation:
By placing the JSON documents in an S3 bucket, the documents will be stored in a highly durable and scalable object storage service. The use of AWS Lambda allows the company to run their Python code to process the documents as they arrive in the S3 bucket without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure. This also allows for horizontal scalability, as AWS Lambda will automatically scale the number of instances of the function based on the incoming rate of requests. The results can be stored in an Amazon Aurora DB cluster, which is a fully-managed, high-performance database service that is compatible with MySQL and PostgreSQL. This will provide the necessary durability and scalability for the results of the processing.

- Using Lambda functions triggered by S3 events allows the Python code to automatically scale up and down based on the number of incoming JSON documents. This provides high availability and maximizes scalability.
- Storing the results in an Amazon Aurora DB cluster provides a managed, scalable, and highly available database.
- This serverless approach minimizes operational overhead since Lambda and Aurora handle provisioning infrastructure, deploying code, monitoring, patching, etc.

Question 71
A company wants to use high performance computing (HPC) infrastructure on AWS for financial risk modeling. The company’s HPC workloads run on Linux. Each HPC workflow runs on hundreds of Amazon EC2 Spot Instances, is short-lived, and generates thousands of output files that are ultimately stored in persistent storage for analytics and long-term future use.
The company seeks a cloud storage solution that permits the copying of on-premises data to long-term persistent storage to make data available for processing by all EC2 instances. The solution should also be a high performance file system that is integrated with persistent storage to read and write datasets and output files.
Which combination of AWS services meets these requirements?
A.
Amazon FSx for Lustre integrated with Amazon S3
B.
Amazon FSx for Windows File Server integrated with Amazon S3
C.
Amazon S3 Glacier integrated with Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS)
D.
Amazon S3 bucket with a VPC endpoint integrated with an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) General Purpose SSD (gp2) volume

Answer: A

Explanation:
Lustre is default when HPC is involved. https://aws.amazon.com/fsx/lustre/
B: mentions Windows and no-one asked for it.
C: S3 Glacier is too slow for HPC
D: I don't think this is possible, unless I'm mistake, how can you connect a VPC endpoint to EBS without an EC2 kind of instance?

FSx for Lustre is a high-performance file system optimized for compute-intensive workloads. It provides scalable, parallel access to data and is suitable for HPC applications.
By integrating FSx for Lustre with S3, you can easily copy on-premises data to long-term persistent storage in S3, making it available for processing by EC2 instances.
S3 serves as the durable and highly scalable object storage for storing the output files, allowing for analytics and long-term future use.
Option B, FSx for Windows File Server, is not suitable because the workloads run on Linux, and this option is designed for Windows file sharing.
Option C, S3 Glacier integrated with EBS, is not the best choice as it is a low-cost archival storage service and not optimized for high-performance file system requirements.
Option D, using an S3 bucket with a VPC endpoint integrated with an Amazon EBS General Purpose SSD (gp2) volume, does not provide the required high-performance file system capabilities for HPC workloads.

Question 72
A company is building a containerized application on premises and decides to move the application to AWS. The application will have thousands of users soon after it is deployed. The company is unsure how to manage the deployment of containers at scale. The company needs to deploy the containerized application in a highly available architecture that minimizes operational overhead.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Store container images in an Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) repository. Use an Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) cluster with the AWS Fargate launch type to run the containers. Use target tracking to scale automatically based on demand.
B.
Store container images in an Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) repository. Use an Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) cluster with the Amazon EC2 launch type to run the containers. Use target tracking to scale automatically based on demand.
C.
Store container images in a repository that runs on an Amazon EC2 instance. Run the containers on EC2 instances that are spread across multiple Availability Zones. Monitor the average CPU utilization in Amazon CloudWatch. Launch new EC2 instances as needed.
D.
Create an Amazon EC2 Amazon Machine Image (AMI) that contains the container image. Launch EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group across multiple Availability Zones. Use an Amazon CloudWatch alarm to scale out EC2 instances when the average CPU utilization threshold is breached.

Answer: A

Explanation:
A is minimal overhead.
B has EC2 overhead
C EC2 instance overhead + container repository running on EC2 overhead
D AMII, CloudWatch alarm is overhead++

Using ECR provides a fully managed container image registry.
ECS with Fargate launch type allows running containers without managing servers or clusters. Fargate will handle scaling and optimization.
Target tracking autoscaling will allow automatically adjusting capacity based on demand.
The serverless approach with Fargate minimizes operational overhead.

Question 73
A company has two applications: a sender application that sends messages with payloads to be processed and a processing application intended to receive the messages with payloads. The company wants to implement an AWS service to handle messages between the two applications. The sender application can send about 1,000 messages each hour. The messages may take up to 2 days to be processed: If the messages fail to process, they must be retained so that they do not impact the processing of any remaining messages.
Which solution meets these requirements and is the MOST operationally efficient?
A.
Set up an Amazon EC2 instance running a Redis database. Configure both applications to use the instance. Store, process, and delete the messages, respectively.
B.
Use an Amazon Kinesis data stream to receive the messages from the sender application. Integrate the processing application with the Kinesis Client Library (KCL).
C.
Integrate the sender and processor applications with an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Configure a dead-letter queue to collect the messages that failed to process.
D.
Subscribe the processing application to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic to receive notifications to process. Integrate the sender application to write to the SNS topic.

Answer: C

Explanation:
Amazon SQS supports dead-letter queues (DLQ), which other queues (source queues) can target for messages that can't be processed (consumed) successfully.
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-dead-letter-queues.html

A) Not operationally efficient
B) Kinesis is for real-time processing
D) SNS is not suitable for work queuing.
C) While this may be the "correct" answer, it also doesn't really fit the problem statement.
Maximum visibility timeout for SQS is 12h, also can't be extended by the consumer.
"If your consumer needs longer than 12 hours, consider using Step Functions."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-visibility-timeout.html

Question 74
A solutions architect must design a solution that uses Amazon CloudFront with an Amazon S3 origin to store a static website. The company’s security policy requires that all website traffic be inspected by AWS WAF.
How should the solutions architect comply with these requirements?
A.
Configure an S3 bucket policy to accept requests coming from the AWS WAF Amazon Resource Name (ARN) only.
B.
Configure Amazon CloudFront to forward all incoming requests to AWS WAF before requesting content from the S3 origin.
C.
Configure a security group that allows Amazon CloudFront IP addresses to access Amazon S3 only. Associate AWS WAF to CloudFront.
D.
Configure Amazon CloudFront and Amazon S3 to use an origin access identity (OAI) to restrict access to the S3 bucket. Enable AWS WAF on the distribution.

Answer: D

Explanation:
Use an OAI to lockdown CloudFront to S3 origin & enable WAF on CF distribution

B is incorrect , it misrepresents how AWS WAF works with CloudFront. AWS WAF is not an intermediary service that CloudFront forwards requests to. Instead, AWS WAF is directly integrated with CloudFront as a layer to inspect incoming requests. The correct configuration is to associate AWS WAF with the CloudFront distribution, not to forward requests separately.

https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/cloudfront-access-to-amazon-s3/ confirms use of OAI (and option D).

Question 75
Organizers for a global event want to put daily reports online as static HTML pages. The pages are expected to generate millions of views from users around the world. The files are stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. A solutions architect has been asked to design an efficient and effective solution.
Which action should the solutions architect take to accomplish this?
A.
Generate presigned URLs for the files.
B.
Use cross-Region replication to all Regions.
C.
Use the geoproximity feature of Amazon Route 53.
D.
Use Amazon CloudFront with the S3 bucket as its origin.

Answer: D

Explanation:
The most effective and efficient solution would be Option D (Use Amazon CloudFront with the S3 bucket as its origin.)
Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) that speeds up the delivery of static and dynamic web content, such as HTML pages, images, and videos. By using CloudFront, the HTML pages will be served to users from the edge location that is closest to them, resulting in faster delivery and a better user experience. CloudFront can also handle the high traffic and large number of requests expected for the global event, ensuring that the HTML pages are available and accessible to users around the world.

Global users = Amazon CloudFront

Question 76
A company runs a production application on a fleet of Amazon EC2 instances. The application reads the data from an Amazon SQS queue and processes the messages in parallel. The message volume is unpredictable and often has intermittent traffic. This application should continually process messages without any downtime.
Which solution meets these requirements MOST cost-effectively?
A.
Use Spot Instances exclusively to handle the maximum capacity required.
B.
Use Reserved Instances exclusively to handle the maximum capacity required.
C.
Use Reserved Instances for the baseline capacity and use Spot Instances to handle additional capacity.
D.
Use Reserved Instances for the baseline capacity and use On-Demand Instances to handle additional capacity.

Answer: C? D?

Explanation:
Selected Answer: C
Using Reserved Instances (RIs) for baseline capacity ensures a lower cost for the instances that are constantly required to maintain the application's baseline workload. RIs offer significant cost savings compared to On-Demand instances, making them a cost-effective choice for steady-state workloads.
Spot Instances can then be utilized to handle additional capacity during periods of higher message volume. Spot Instances provide spare EC2 capacity at significantly reduced prices compared to On-Demand instances, allowing for cost savings during peak workloads. Since the message volume is unpredictable and often intermittent, Spot Instances can efficiently handle the fluctuating demand without incurring high costs.

Selected Answer: D
Reserved Instances for Baseline + On-Demand for unpredictable volume and intermittent traffic without downtime.
Keywords:
1. Production Application
2. Unpredictable Volume and intermittent traffic
3. Without any down-time
Spot-instances is a cheaper option, but cannot guarantee downtime, and it is subject to availability too, hence the best choice is to go for On-Demand instances.

Question 77
A security team wants to limit access to specific services or actions in all of the team’s AWS accounts. All accounts belong to a large organization in AWS Organizations. The solution must be scalable and there must be a single point where permissions can be maintained.
What should a solutions architect do to accomplish this?
A.
Create an ACL to provide access to the services or actions.
B.
Create a security group to allow accounts and attach it to user groups.
C.
Create cross-account roles in each account to deny access to the services or actions.
D.
Create a service control policy in the root organizational unit to deny access to the services or actions.

Answer: D

Explanation:
By creating an SCP in the root organizational unit, the security team can define and enforce fine-grained permissions that limit access to specific services or actions across all member accounts. The SCP acts as a guardrail, denying access to specified services or actions, ensuring that the permissions are consistent and applied uniformly across the organization. SCPs are scalable and provide a single point of control for managing permissions, allowing the security team to centrally manage access restrictions without needing to modify individual account settings.
Option A and option B are not suitable for controlling access across multiple accounts in AWS Organizations. ACLs and security groups are typically used for managing network traffic and access within a single account or a specific resource.
Option C is not the recommended approach. Cross-account roles are used for granting access, and denying access through cross-account roles can be complex and less manageable compared to using SCPs.

Service control policies (SCPs) are one type of policy that you can use to manage your organization. SCPs offer central control over the maximum available permissions for all accounts in your organization, allowing you to ensure your accounts stay within your organization's access control guidelines. See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scp.html.

Question 78
A company is concerned about the security of its public web application due to recent web attacks. The application uses an Application Load Balancer (ALB). A solutions architect must reduce the risk of DDoS attacks against the application.
What should the solutions architect do to meet this requirement?
A.
Add an Amazon Inspector agent to the ALB.
B.
Configure Amazon Macie to prevent attacks.
C.
Enable AWS Shield Advanced to prevent attacks.
D.
Configure Amazon GuardDuty to monitor the ALB.

Answer: C

Explanation:
By enabling Shield Advanced, the web application benefits from automatic protection against common and sophisticated DDoS attacks. It utilizes advanced detection and mitigation techniques, including ML algorithms and traffic analysis, to provide effective DDoS protection.
It also includes features like real-time monitoring, attack notifications, and detailed attack reports.
A is not related to DDoS protection. Amazon Inspector is a security assessment service that helps identify vulnerabilities and security issues in applications and EC2.
B is also not the appropriate solution. Macie is a service that uses machine learning to discover, classify, and protect sensitive data stored in AWS. It focuses on data security and protection, not specifically on DDoS prevention.
D is not the most effective solution. GuardDuty is a threat detection service that analyzes events and network traffic to identify potential security threats and anomalies. While it can provide insights into potential DDoS attacks, it does not actively prevent or mitigate them.

Question 79
A company is implementing a new business application. The application runs on two Amazon EC2 instances and uses an Amazon S3 bucket for document storage. A solutions architect needs to ensure that the EC2 instances can access the S3 bucket.
What should the solutions architect do to meet this requirement?
A.
Create an IAM role that grants access to the S3 bucket. Attach the role to the EC2 instances.
B.
Create an IAM policy that grants access to the S3 bucket. Attach the policy to the EC2 instances.
C.
Create an IAM group that grants access to the S3 bucket. Attach the group to the EC2 instances.
D.
Create an IAM user that grants access to the S3 bucket. Attach the user account to the EC2 instances.

Answer: A

Explanation:
The correct option to meet this requirement is A: Create an IAM role that grants access to the S3 bucket and attach the role to the EC2 instances.
An IAM role is an AWS resource that allows you to delegate access to AWS resources and services. You can create an IAM role that grants access to the S3 bucket and then attach the role to the EC2 instances. This will allow the EC2 instances to access the S3 bucket and the documents stored within it.
Option B is incorrect because an IAM policy is used to define permissions for an IAM user or group, not for an EC2 instance.
Option C is incorrect because an IAM group is used to group together IAM users and policies, not to grant access to resources.
Option D is incorrect because an IAM user is used to represent a person or service that interacts with AWS resources, not to grant access to resources.

Question 80
A company’s web application is running on Amazon EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer. The company recently changed its policy, which now requires the application to be accessed from one specific country only.
Which configuration will meet this requirement?
A.
Configure the security group for the EC2 instances.
B.
Configure the security group on the Application Load Balancer.
C.
Configure AWS WAF on the Application Load Balancer in a VPC.
D.
Configure the network ACL for the subnet that contains the EC2 instances.

Answer: C

Explanation:
By configuring AWS WAF on the ALB in a VPC, you can apply access control rules based on the geographic location of the incoming requests. AWS WAF allows you to create rules that include conditions based on the IP addresses' country of origin. You can specify the desired country and deny access to requests originating from any other country by leveraging AWS WAF's Geo Match feature.
Option A and option B focus on network-level access control and do not provide country-specific filtering capabilities.
Option D is not the ideal solution for restricting access based on country. Network ACLs primarily control traffic at the subnet level based on IP addresses and port numbers, but they do not have built-in capabilities for country-based filtering.

Geographic (Geo) Match Conditions in AWS WAF. This new condition type allows you to use AWS WAF to restrict application access based on the geographic location of your viewers. With geo match conditions you can choose the countries from which AWS WAF should allow access.
https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/10/aws-waf-now-supports-geographic-match/

Question 81
A company provides an API to its users that automates inquiries for tax computations based on item prices. The company experiences a larger number of inquiries during the holiday season only that cause slower response times. A solutions architect needs to design a solution that is scalable and elastic.
What should the solutions architect do to accomplish this?
A.
Provide an API hosted on an Amazon EC2 instance. The EC2 instance performs the required computations when the API request is made.
B.
Design a REST API using Amazon API Gateway that accepts the item names. API Gateway passes item names to AWS Lambda for tax computations.
C.
Create an Application Load Balancer that has two Amazon EC2 instances behind it. The EC2 instances will compute the tax on the received item names.
D.
Design a REST API using Amazon API Gateway that connects with an API hosted on an Amazon EC2 instance. API Gateway accepts and passes the item names to the EC2 instance for tax computations.

Answer: B

Explanation:
Option D is similar to option B in that it uses Amazon API Gateway to handle the API requests, but it also includes an EC2 instance to perform the tax computations. However, using an EC2 instance in this way is less scalable and less elastic than using AWS Lambda to perform the computations. An EC2 instance is a fixed resource and requires manual scaling and management, while Lambda is an event-driven, serverless compute service that automatically scales with the number of requests, making it more suitable for handling variable workloads and reducing response times during high traffic periods. Additionally, Lambda is more cost-efficient than EC2 instances, as you only pay for the compute time consumed by your functions, making it a more cost-effective solution.

Question 82
A solutions architect is creating a new Amazon CloudFront distribution for an application. Some of the information submitted by users is sensitive. The application uses HTTPS but needs another layer of security. The sensitive information should.be protected throughout the entire application stack, and access to the information should be restricted to certain applications.
Which action should the solutions architect take?
A.
Configure a CloudFront signed URL.
B.
Configure a CloudFront signed cookie.
C.
Configure a CloudFront field-level encryption profile.
D.
Configure CloudFront and set the Origin Protocol Policy setting to HTTPS Only for the Viewer Protocol Policy.

Answer: C

Explanation:
Field-level encryption allows you to enable your users to securely upload sensitive information to your web servers. The sensitive information provided by your users is encrypted at the edge, close to the user, and remains encrypted throughout your entire application stack. This encryption ensures that only applications that need the data—and have the credentials to decrypt it—are able to do so.

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/field-level-encryption.html

Question 83
A gaming company hosts a browser-based application on AWS. The users of the application consume a large number of videos and images that are stored in Amazon S3. This content is the same for all users.
The application has increased in popularity, and millions of users worldwide accessing these media files. The company wants to provide the files to the users while reducing the load on the origin.
Which solution meets these requirements MOST cost-effectively?
A.
Deploy an AWS Global Accelerator accelerator in front of the web servers.
B.
Deploy an Amazon CloudFront web distribution in front of the S3 bucket.
C.
Deploy an Amazon ElastiCache for Redis instance in front of the web servers.
D.
Deploy an Amazon ElastiCache for Memcached instance in front of the web servers.

Answer: B

Explanation:
B) Deploy an Amazon CloudFront web distribution in front of the S3 bucket.
CloudFront is the most cost-effective solution for this use case because:
CloudFront can cache static assets like videos and images at edge locations closer to users. This improves performance.
Serving files from the CloudFront cache reduces load on the S3 origin.
CloudFront pricing is very low for data transfer and requests.

Option A is not the most cost-effective solution for this scenario. While Global Accelerator can improve global application performance, it is primarily used for accelerating TCP and UDP traffic, such as gaming and real-time applications, rather than serving static media files.
Options C and D are used for caching frequently accessed data in-memory to improve application performance. However, they are not specifically designed for caching and serving media files like CloudFront, and therefore, may not provide the same cost-effectiveness and scalability for this use case.
Hence, deploying an CloudFront web distribution in front of the S3 is the most cost-effective solution for delivering media files to millions of users worldwide while reducing the load on the origin.

Question 84
A company has a multi-tier application that runs six front-end web servers in an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group in a single Availability Zone behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB). A solutions architect needs to modify the infrastructure to be highly available without modifying the application.
Which architecture should the solutions architect choose that provides high availability?
A.
Create an Auto Scaling group that uses three instances across each of two Regions.
B.
Modify the Auto Scaling group to use three instances across each of two Availability Zones.
C.
Create an Auto Scaling template that can be used to quickly create more instances in another Region.
D.
Change the ALB in front of the Amazon EC2 instances in a round-robin configuration to balance traffic to the web tier.

Answer: B

Explanation:
Selected Answer: B
Option A (creating an Auto Scaling group across two Regions) introduces additional complexity and potential replication challenges, which may not be necessary for achieving high availability within a single Region.
Option C (creating an Auto Scaling template for another Region) suggests multi-region redundancy, which may not be the most straightforward solution for achieving high availability without modifying the application.
Option D (changing the ALB to a round-robin configuration) does not provide the desired high availability. Round-robin configuration alone does not ensure fault tolerance and does not leverage multiple Availability Zones for resilience.
Hence, modifying the Auto Scaling group to use three instances across each of two Availability Zones is the appropriate choice to provide high availability for the multi-tier application.

Question 85
An ecommerce company has an order-processing application that uses Amazon API Gateway and an AWS Lambda function. The application stores data in an Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL database. During a recent sales event, a sudden surge in customer orders occurred. Some customers experienced timeouts, and the application did not process the orders of those customers.
A solutions architect determined that the CPU utilization and memory utilization were high on the database because of a large number of open connections. The solutions architect needs to prevent the timeout errors while making the least possible changes to the application.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Configure provisioned concurrency for the Lambda function. Modify the database to be a global database in multiple AWS Regions.
B.
Use Amazon RDS Proxy to create a proxy for the database. Modify the Lambda function to use the RDS Proxy endpoint instead of the database endpoint.
C.
Create a read replica for the database in a different AWS Region. Use query string parameters in API Gateway to route traffic to the read replica.
D.
Migrate the data from Aurora PostgreSQL to Amazon DynamoDB by using AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS). Modify the Lambda function to use the DynamoDB table.

Answer: B

Explanation:
Many applications, including those built on modern serverless architectures, can have a large number of open connections to the database server and may open and close database connections at a high rate, exhausting database memory and compute resources. Amazon RDS Proxy allows applications to pool and share connections established with the database, improving database efficiency and application scalability.
https://aws.amazon.com/id/rds/proxy/

Option A (configuring provisioned concurrency and creating a global database) does not directly address the high connection utilization issue on the database, and creating a global database may introduce additional complexity without immediate benefit to solving the timeout errors.
Option C (creating a read replica in a different AWS Region) introduces additional data replication and management complexity, which may not be necessary to address the timeout errors.
Option D (migrating to Amazon DynamoDB) involves a significant change in the data storage technology and requires modifying the application to use DynamoDB instead of Aurora PostgreSQL. This may not be the most suitable solution when the goal is to make minimal changes to the application.
Therefore, using Amazon RDS Proxy and modifying the Lambda function to use the RDS Proxy endpoint is the recommended solution to prevent timeout errors and reduce the impact on the database during peak loads.

Question 86
An application runs on Amazon EC2 instances in private subnets. The application needs to access an Amazon DynamoDB table.
What is the MOST secure way to access the table while ensuring that the traffic does not leave the AWS network?
A.
Use a VPC endpoint for DynamoDB.
B.
Use a NAT gateway in a public subnet.
C.
Use a NAT instance in a private subnet.
D.
Use the internet gateway attached to the VPC.

Answer: A

Explanation:
VPC endpoints for service in private subnets
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/vpc-endpoints-dynamodb.html

Question 87
An entertainment company is using Amazon DynamoDB to store media metadata. The application is read intensive and experiencing delays. The company does not have staff to handle additional operational overhead and needs to improve the performance efficiency of DynamoDB without reconfiguring the application.
What should a solutions architect recommend to meet this requirement?
A.
Use Amazon ElastiCache for Redis.
B.
Use Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX).
C.
Replicate data by using DynamoDB global tables.
D.
Use Amazon ElastiCache for Memcached with Auto Discovery enabled.

Answer: B

Explanation:
DAX stands for DynamoDB Accelerator, and it's like a turbo boost for your DynamoDB tables. It's a fully managed, in-memory cache that speeds up the read and write performance of your DynamoDB tables, so you can get your data faster than ever before.

A. Using Amazon ElastiCache for Redis would require modifying the application code and is not specifically designed to enhance DynamoDB performance.
C. Replicating data with DynamoDB global tables would require additional configuration and operational overhead.
D. Using Amazon ElastiCache for Memcached with Auto Discovery enabled would also require application code modifications and is not specifically designed for improving DynamoDB performance.
In contrast, option B, using Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX), is the recommended solution as it is purpose-built for enhancing DynamoDB performance without the need for application reconfiguration. DAX provides a managed caching layer that significantly reduces read latency and offloads traffic from DynamoDB tables.

Question 88
A company’s infrastructure consists of Amazon EC2 instances and an Amazon RDS DB instance in a single AWS Region. The company wants to back up its data in a separate Region.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?
A.
Use AWS Backup to copy EC2 backups and RDS backups to the separate Region.
B.
Use Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager (Amazon DLM) to copy EC2 backups and RDS backups to the separate Region.
C.
Create Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) of the EC2 instances. Copy the AMIs to the separate Region. Create a read replica for the RDS DB instance in the separate Region.
D.
Create Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) snapshots. Copy the EBS snapshots to the separate Region. Create RDS snapshots. Export the RDS snapshots to Amazon S3. Configure S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR) to the separate Region.

Answer: A

Explanation:
Using AWS Backup to copy EC2 and RDS backups to the separate Region is the solution that meets the requirements with the least operational overhead. AWS Backup simplifies the backup process and automates the copying of backups to another Region, reducing the manual effort and operational complexity involved in managing separate backup processes for EC2 instances and RDS databases.
Option B is incorrect because Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager (Amazon DLM) is not designed for directly copying RDS backups to a separate region.
Option C is incorrect because creating Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) and read replicas adds complexity and operational overhead compared to a dedicated backup solution.
Option D is incorrect because using Amazon EBS snapshots, RDS snapshots, and S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR) involves multiple manual steps and additional configuration, increasing complexity.

Question 89
A solutions architect needs to securely store a database user name and password that an application uses to access an Amazon RDS DB instance. The application that accesses the database runs on an Amazon EC2 instance. The solutions architect wants to create a secure parameter in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store.
What should the solutions architect do to meet this requirement?
A.
Create an IAM role that has read access to the Parameter Store parameter. Allow Decrypt access to an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key that is used to encrypt the parameter. Assign this IAM role to the EC2 instance.
B.
Create an IAM policy that allows read access to the Parameter Store parameter. Allow Decrypt access to an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key that is used to encrypt the parameter. Assign this IAM policy to the EC2 instance.
C.
Create an IAM trust relationship between the Parameter Store parameter and the EC2 instance. Specify Amazon RDS as a principal in the trust policy.
D.
Create an IAM trust relationship between the DB instance and the EC2 instance. Specify Systems Manager as a principal in the trust policy.

Answer: A

Explanation:
To securely store a database user name and password in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store and allow an application running on an EC2 instance to access it, the solutions architect should create an IAM role that has read access to the Parameter Store parameter and allow Decrypt access to an AWS KMS key that is used to encrypt the parameter. The solutions architect should then assign this IAM role to the EC2 instance.
This approach allows the EC2 instance to access the parameter in the Parameter Store and decrypt it using the specified KMS key while enforcing the necessary security controls to ensure that the parameter is only accessible to authorized parties.

Option B, would not be sufficient, as IAM policies cannot be directly attached to EC2 instances.
Option C, would not be a valid solution, as the Parameter Store parameter and the EC2 instance are not entities that can be related through an IAM trust relationship.
Option D, would not be a valid solution, as the trust policy would not allow the EC2 instance to access the parameter in the Parameter Store or decrypt it using the specified KMS key.

Question 90
An application development team is designing a microservice that will convert large images to smaller, compressed images. When a user uploads an image through the web interface, the microservice should store the image in an Amazon S3 bucket, process and compress the image with an AWS Lambda function, and store the image in its compressed form in a different S3 bucket.
A solutions architect needs to design a solution that uses durable, stateless components to process the images automatically.
Which combination of actions will meet these requirements? (Choose two.)
A.
Create an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Configure the S3 bucket to send a notification to the SQS queue when an image is uploaded to the S3 bucket.
B.
Configure the Lambda function to use the Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue as the invocation source. When the SQS message is successfully processed, delete the message in the queue.
C.
Configure the Lambda function to monitor the S3 bucket for new uploads. When an uploaded image is detected, write the file name to a text file in memory and use the text file to keep track of the images that were processed.
D.
Launch an Amazon EC2 instance to monitor an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. When items are added to the queue, log the file name in a text file on the EC2 instance and invoke the Lambda function.
E.
Configure an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) event to monitor the S3 bucket. When an image is uploaded, send an alert to an Amazon ample Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic with the application owner's email address for further processing.

Answer: AB

Explanation:
To design a solution that uses durable, stateless components to process images automatically, a solutions architect could consider the following actions:
Option A involves creating an SQS queue and configuring the S3 bucket to send a notification to the queue when an image is uploaded. This allows the application to decouple the image upload process from the image processing process and ensures that the image processing process is triggered automatically when a new image is uploaded.
Option B involves configuring the Lambda function to use the SQS queue as the invocation source. When the SQS message is successfully processed, the message is deleted from the queue. This ensures that the Lambda function is invoked only once per image and that the image is not processed multiple times.

Option C is incorrect because it involves storing state (the file name) in memory, which is not a durable or scalable solution.
Option D is incorrect because it involves launching an EC2 instance to monitor the SQS queue, which is not a stateless solution.
Option E is incorrect because it involves using Amazon EventBridge (formerly Amazon CloudWatch Events) to send an alert to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic, which is not related to the image processing process.

Question 91
A company is designing a cloud communications platform that is driven by APIs. The application is hosted on Amazon EC2 instances behind a Network Load Balancer (NLB). The company uses Amazon API Gateway to provide external users with access to the application through APIs. The company wants to protect the platform against web exploits like SQL injection and also wants to detect and mitigate large, sophisticated DDoS attacks.
Which combination of solutions provides the MOST protection? (Choose two.)
A.
Use AWS WAF to protect the NLB.
B.
Use AWS Shield Advanced with the NLB.
C.
Use AWS WAF to protect Amazon API Gateway.
D.
Use Amazon GuardDuty with AWS Shield Standard
E.
Use AWS Shield Standard with Amazon API Gateway.

Answer: BC

Explanation:
Shield - Load Balancer, CF, Route53
AWF - CF, ALB, API Gateway

B) Use AWS Shield Advanced with the NLB
C) Use AWS WAF to protect Amazon API Gateway
The key reasons are:
AWS Shield Advanced provides expanded DDoS protection against larger and more sophisticated attacks
Using it with the NLB helps protect against network floods
WAF still provides critical protection against exploits at the API lay

Question 92
A company has a legacy data processing application that runs on Amazon EC2 instances. Data is processed sequentially, but the order of results does not matter. The application uses a monolithic architecture. The only way that the company can scale the application to meet increased demand is to increase the size of the instances.
The company’s developers have decided to rewrite the application to use a microservices architecture on Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS).
What should a solutions architect recommend for communication between the microservices?
A.
Create an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Add code to the data producers, and send data to the queue. Add code to the data consumers to process data from the queue.
B.
Create an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic. Add code to the data producers, and publish notifications to the topic. Add code to the data consumers to subscribe to the topic.
C.
Create an AWS Lambda function to pass messages. Add code to the data producers to call the Lambda function with a data object. Add code to the data consumers to receive a data object that is passed from the Lambda function.
D.
Create an Amazon DynamoDB table. Enable DynamoDB Streams. Add code to the data producers to insert data into the table. Add code to the data consumers to use the DynamoDB Streams API to detect new table entries and retrieve the data.

Answer: A

Explanation:
Option B, using Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS), would not be suitable for this use case, as SNS is a pub/sub messaging service that is designed for one-to-many communication, rather than point-to-point communication between specific microservices.
Option C, using an AWS Lambda function to pass messages, would not be suitable for this use case, as it would require the data producers and data consumers to have a direct connection and invoke the Lambda function, rather than being decoupled through a message queue.
Option D, using an Amazon DynamoDB table with DynamoDB Streams, would not be suitable for this use case, as it would require the data consumers to continuously poll the DynamoDB Streams API to detect new table entries, rather than being notified of new data through a message queue.

Create an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Add code to the data producers, and send data to the queue. Add code to the data consumers to process data from the queue.
For asynchronous communication between decoupled microservices, an SQS queue is the most appropriate service to use.
SQS provides a scalable, highly available queue to buffer messages between producers and consumers.
The order of processing does not matter, so a queue model fits well.
The consumers can scale independently to process messages from the queue.

Question 93
A company wants to migrate its MySQL database from on premises to AWS. The company recently experienced a database outage that significantly impacted the business. To ensure this does not happen again, the company wants a reliable database solution on AWS that minimizes data loss and stores every transaction on at least two nodes.
Which solution meets these requirements?
A.
Create an Amazon RDS DB instance with synchronous replication to three nodes in three Availability Zones.
B.
Create an Amazon RDS MySQL DB instance with Multi-AZ functionality enabled to synchronously replicate the data.
C.
Create an Amazon RDS MySQL DB instance and then create a read replica in a separate AWS Region that synchronously replicates the data.
D.
Create an Amazon EC2 instance with a MySQL engine installed that triggers an AWS Lambda function to synchronously replicate the data to an Amazon RDS MySQL DB instance.

Answer: B

Explanation:
Amazon RDS MySQL DB instance with Multi-AZ functionality enabled to synchronously replicate the data
Standby DB in Multi-AZ- synchronous replication
Read Replica always asynchronous. so option C is ignored.

RDS Multi-AZ = Synchronous = Disaster Recovery (DR)
Read Replica = Asynchronous = High Availability

B. Create an Amazon RDS MySQL DB instance with Multi-AZ functionality enabled to synchronously replicate the data.
Enabling Multi-AZ functionality in Amazon RDS ensures synchronous replication of data to a standby replica in a different Availability Zone. This provides high availability and minimizes data loss in the event of a database outage.
A. Creating an Amazon RDS DB instance with synchronous replication to three nodes in three Availability Zones would provide even higher availability but is not necessary for the stated requirements.
C. Creating a read replica in a separate AWS Region would provide disaster recovery capabilities but does not ensure synchronous replication or meet the requirement of storing every transaction on at least two nodes.
D. Using an EC2 instance with a MySQL engine and triggering an AWS Lambda function for replication introduces unnecessary complexity and is not the most suitable solution for ensuring reliable and synchronous replication.

Question 94
A company is building a new dynamic ordering website. The company wants to minimize server maintenance and patching. The website must be highly available and must scale read and write capacity as quickly as possible to meet changes in user demand.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Host static content in Amazon S3. Host dynamic content by using Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda. Use Amazon DynamoDB with on-demand capacity for the database. Configure Amazon CloudFront to deliver the website content.
B.
Host static content in Amazon S3. Host dynamic content by using Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda. Use Amazon Aurora with Aurora Auto Scaling for the database. Configure Amazon CloudFront to deliver the website content.
C.
Host all the website content on Amazon EC2 instances. Create an Auto Scaling group to scale the EC2 instances. Use an Application Load Balancer to distribute traffic. Use Amazon DynamoDB with provisioned write capacity for the database.
D.
Host all the website content on Amazon EC2 instances. Create an Auto Scaling group to scale the EC2 instances. Use an Application Load Balancer to distribute traffic. Use Amazon Aurora with Aurora Auto Scaling for the database.

Answer: A

Explanation:
C,D are out due to EC2 scaling which is not ideal for static content scaling.
A and B are logical choices. B uses Aurora which is more for relational database and comes with the baggage and limitations of RDBMS scaling. DynamDB (no SQL) is easier to scale for both read and write. A is simply better than be for an ordering website so that is the better option. Note that B would have been good if A wasn't a choice.

The answer is A and NOT B on this one as the company is building an ordering website (OLTP). DynamoDB's high performance read and writes are perfect for an OLTP use case.

Question 95
A company has an AWS account used for software engineering. The AWS account has access to the company’s on-premises data center through a pair of AWS Direct Connect connections. All non-VPC traffic routes to the virtual private gateway.
A development team recently created an AWS Lambda function through the console. The development team needs to allow the function to access a database that runs in a private subnet in the company’s data center.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Configure the Lambda function to run in the VPC with the appropriate security group.
B.
Set up a VPN connection from AWS to the data center. Route the traffic from the Lambda function through the VPN.
C.
Update the route tables in the VPC to allow the Lambda function to access the on-premises data center through Direct Connect.
D.
Create an Elastic IP address. Configure the Lambda function to send traffic through the Elastic IP address without an elastic network interface.

Answer: A

Explanation:
To configure a VPC for an existing function:
1. Open the Functions page of the Lambda console.
2. Choose a function.
3. Choose Configuration and then choose VPC.
4. Under VPC, choose Edit.
5. Choose a VPC, subnets, and security groups. <-- **That's why I believe the answer is A**.
Note:
If your function needs internet access, use network address translation (NAT). Connecting a function to a public subnet doesn't give it internet access or a public IP address.

C is not correct at all as in the question it metions that the VPC already has connectivity with on-premises

Question 96
A company runs an application using Amazon ECS. The application creates resized versions of an original image and then makes Amazon S3 API calls to store the resized images in Amazon S3.
How can a solutions architect ensure that the application has permission to access Amazon S3?
A.
Update the S3 role in AWS IAM to allow read/write access from Amazon ECS, and then relaunch the container.
B.
Create an IAM role with S3 permissions, and then specify that role as the taskRoleArn in the task definition.
C.
Create a security group that allows access from Amazon ECS to Amazon S3, and update the launch configuration used by the ECS cluster.
D.
Create an IAM user with S3 permissions, and then relaunch the Amazon EC2 instances for the ECS cluster while logged in as this account.

Answer: B

Explanation:
Option B: Create an IAM role with S3 permissions and specify that role as the taskRoleArn in the task definition. This approach allows the ECS task to assume the specified role and gain the necessary permissions to access Amazon S3.
Option A is incorrect because updating the S3 role in IAM and relaunching the container does not associate the updated role with the ECS task.
Option C is incorrect because creating a security group that allows access from Amazon ECS to Amazon S3 does not grant the necessary permissions to the ECS task.
Option D is incorrect because creating an IAM user with S3 permissions and relaunching the EC2 instances for the ECS cluster does not associate the IAM user with the ECS task.

Question 97
A company has a Windows-based application that must be migrated to AWS. The application requires the use of a shared Windows file system attached to multiple Amazon EC2 Windows instances that are deployed across multiple Availability Zone:
What should a solutions architect do to meet this requirement?
A.
Configure AWS Storage Gateway in volume gateway mode. Mount the volume to each Windows instance.
B.
Configure Amazon FSx for Windows File Server. Mount the Amazon FSx file system to each Windows instance.
C.
Configure a file system by using Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS). Mount the EFS file system to each Windows instance.
D.
Configure an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume with the required size. Attach each EC2 instance to the volume. Mount the file system within the volume to each Windows instance.

Answer: B

Explanation:
Option B: Configure Amazon FSx for Windows File Server. This service provides a fully managed Windows file system that can be easily shared across multiple EC2 Windows instances. It offers high performance and supports Windows applications that require file storage.
Option A is incorrect because AWS Storage Gateway in volume gateway mode is not designed for shared file systems.
Option C is incorrect because while Amazon EFS can be mounted to multiple instances, it is a Linux-based file system and may not be suitable for Windows applications.
Option D is incorrect because attaching and mounting an Amazon EBS volume to multiple instances simultaneously is not supported.

Question 98
A company is developing an ecommerce application that will consist of a load-balanced front end, a container-based application, and a relational database. A solutions architect needs to create a highly available solution that operates with as little manual intervention as possible.
Which solutions meet these requirements? (Choose two.)
A.
Create an Amazon RDS DB instance in Multi-AZ mode.
B.
Create an Amazon RDS DB instance and one or more replicas in another Availability Zone.
C.
Create an Amazon EC2 instance-based Docker cluster to handle the dynamic application load.
D.
Create an Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) cluster with a Fargate launch type to handle the dynamic application load.
E.
Create an Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) cluster with an Amazon EC2 launch type to handle the dynamic application load.

Answer: AD

Explanation:
https://containersonaws.com/introduction/ec2-or-aws-fargate/
A.(O) multi-az <= 'little intervention'
B.(X) read replica <= Promoting a read replica to be a standalone DB instance
You can promote a read replica into a standalone DB instance. When you promote a read replica, the DB instance is rebooted before it becomes available.
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_ReadRepl.html
C.(X) use Amazon ECS instead of EC2-based docker for little human intervention
D.(O) Amazon ECS on AWS Fargate : AWS Fargate is a technology that you can use with Amazon ECS to run containers without having to manage servers or clusters of Amazon EC2 instances.
E.(X) EC2 launch type
The EC2 launch type can be used to run your containerized applications on Amazon EC2 instances that you register to your Amazon ECS cluster and manage yourself.

Question 99
A company uses Amazon S3 as its data lake. The company has a new partner that must use SFTP to upload data files. A solutions architect needs to implement a highly available SFTP solution that minimizes operational overhead.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A.
Use AWS Transfer Family to configure an SFTP-enabled server with a publicly accessible endpoint. Choose the S3 data lake as the destination.
B.
Use Amazon S3 File Gateway as an SFTP server. Expose the S3 File Gateway endpoint URL to the new partner. Share the S3 File Gateway endpoint with the new partner.
C.
Launch an Amazon EC2 instance in a private subnet in a VPInstruct the new partner to upload files to the EC2 instance by using a VPN. Run a cron job script, on the EC2 instance to upload files to the S3 data lake.
D.
Launch Amazon EC2 instances in a private subnet in a VPC. Place a Network Load Balancer (NLB) in front of the EC2 instances. Create an SFTP listener port for the NLB. Share the NLB hostname with the new partner. Run a cron job script on the EC2 instances to upload files to the S3 data lake.

Answer: A

Explanation:
AWS Transfer Family securely scales your recurring business-to-business file transfers to AWS Storage services using SFTP, FTPS, FTP, and AS2 protocols.

Question 100
A company needs to store contract documents. A contract lasts for 5 years. During the 5-year period, the company must ensure that the documents cannot be overwritten or deleted. The company needs to encrypt the documents at rest and rotate the encryption keys automatically every year.
Which combination of steps should a solutions architect take to meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead? (Choose two.)
A.
Store the documents in Amazon S3. Use S3 Object Lock in governance mode.
B.
Store the documents in Amazon S3. Use S3 Object Lock in compliance mode.
C.
Use server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed encryption keys (SSE-S3). Configure key rotation.
D.
Use server-side encryption with AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer managed keys. Configure key rotation.
E.
Use server-side encryption with AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer provided (imported) keys. Configure key rotation.

Answer: BD

Explanation:
Originally answered B and C due to least operational overhead. after research its bugging me that the s3 key rotation is determined based on AWS master Key rotation which cannot guarantee the key is rotated with in a 365 day period. stated as "varies" in the documentation. also its impossible to configure this in the console.
KMS-C is a tick box in the console to turn on annual key rotation but requires more operational overhead than SSE-S3.
C - will not guarantee the questions objectives but requires little overhead.
D - will guarantee the questions objective with more overhead.

B: S3 Compliance Mode ensures no one can overwrite or delete the object.
D: Customer-managed KMS Key: (must be enabled) automatic every 1 year
Options not right:
A: Governance mode allows override and delete.
C: SSE-S3 customer do not have control on rotation of keys(Which is once a year in our requirement)
E: As per AWS Documentation, Customer Imported keys cannot be auto rotated.

Question 101
A company has a three-tier web application that is deployed on AWS. The web servers are deployed in a public subnet in a VPC. The application servers and database servers are deployed in private subnets in the same VPC. The company has deployed a third-party virtual firewall appliance from AWS Marketplace in an inspection VPC. The appliance is configured with an IP interface that can accept IP packets.
A solutions architect needs to integrate the web application with the appliance to inspect all traffic to the application before the traffic reaches the web server.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?
A.
Create a Network Load Balancer in the public subnet of the application's VPC to route the traffic to the appliance for packet inspection.
B.
Create an Application Load Balancer in the public subnet of the application's VPC to route the traffic to the appliance for packet inspection.
C.
Deploy a transit gateway in the inspection VPConfigure route tables to route the incoming packets through the transit gateway.
D.
Deploy a Gateway Load Balancer in the inspection VPC. Create a Gateway Load Balancer endpoint to receive the incoming packets and forward the packets to the appliance.

Answer: D

Explanation:
Gateway Load Balancer is a new type of load balancer that operates at layer 3 of the OSI model and is built on Hyperplane, which is capable of handling several thousands of connections per second. Gateway Load Balancer endpoints are configured in spoke VPCs originating or receiving traffic from the Internet. This architecture allows you to perform inline inspection of traffic from multiple spoke VPCs in a simplified and scalable fashion while still centralizing your virtual appliances.
